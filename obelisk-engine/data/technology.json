          "standfirst": "For decades, we have adapted to software. We learned shell commands, memorized HTTP method names and wired together SDKs. Each interface assumed we would speak its language. In the 1980s, we typed &#x27;grep&#x27;, &#x27;ssh&#x27; and &#x27;ls&#x27; into a shell; by the mid-2000s, we were invoking REST endpoints like GET /users; by the 2010s, we imported SDKs (client.orders.list()) so we didn’t have to think about HTTP. But underlying each of those steps was the same premise: Expose capabilities in a structured form so others can invoke them.But now we are entering the next interface paradigm. Modern LLMs are challenging the notion that a user must choose a function or remember a method signature. Instead of “Which API do I call?” the question becomes: “What outcome am I trying to achieve?” In other words, the interface is shifting from code → to language. In this shift, Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerges as the abstraction that allows models to interpret human intent, discover capabilities and execute workflows, effectively exposing software functions not as programmers know them, but as natural-language requests.MCP is not a hype-term; multiple independent studies identify the architectural shift required for “LLM-consumable” tool invocation. One blog by Akamai engineers describes the transition from traditional APIs to “language-driven integrations” for LLMs. Another academic paper on “AI agentic workflows and enterprise APIs” talks about how enterprise API architecture must evolve to support goal-oriented agents rather than human-driven calls. In short: We are no longer merely designing APIs for code; we are designing capabilities for intent.Why does this matter for enterprises? Because enterprises are drowning in internal systems, integration sprawl and user training costs. Workers struggle not because they don’t have tools, but because they have too many tools, each with its own interface. When natural language becomes the primary interface, the barrier of “which function do I call?” disappears. One recent business blog observed that natural‐language interfaces (NLIs) are enabling self-serve data access for marketers who previously had to wait for analysts to write SQL. When the user just states intent (like “fetch last quarter revenue for region X and flag anomalies”), the system underneath can translate that into calls, orchestration, context memory and deliver results. Natural language becomes not a convenience, but the interfaceTo understand how this evolution works, consider the interface ladder:EraInterfaceWho it was built forCLIShell commandsExpert users typing textAPIWeb or RPC endpointsDevelopers integrating systemsSDKLibrary functionsProgrammers using abstractionsNatural language (MCP)Intent-based requestsHuman + AI agents stating what they wantThrough each step, humans had to “learn the machine’s language.” With MCP, the machine absorbs the human’s language and works out the rest. That’s not just UX improvement, it’s an architectural shift.Under MCP, functions of code are still there: data access, business logic and orchestration. But they’re discovered rather than invoked manually. For example, rather than calling \"billingApi.fetchInvoices(customerId=…),\" you say “Show all invoices for Acme Corp since January and highlight any late payments.” The model resolves the entities, calls the right systems, filters and returns structured insight. The developer’s work shifts from wiring endpoints to defining capability surfaces and guardrails.This shift transforms developer experience and enterprise integration. Teams often struggle to onboard new tools because they require mapping schemas, writing glue code and training users. With a natural-language front, onboarding involves defining business entity names, declaring capabilities and exposing them via the protocol. The human (or AI agent) no longer needs to know parameter names or call order. Studies show that using LLMs as interfaces to APIs can reduce the time and resources required to develop chatbots or tool-invoked workflows.The change also brings productivity benefits. Enterprises that adopt LLM-driven interfaces can turn data access latency (hours/days) into conversation latency (seconds). For instance, if an analyst previously had to export CSVs, run transforms and deploy slides, a language interface allows “Summarize the top five risk factors for churn over the last quarter” and generate narrative + visuals in one go. The human then reviews, adjusts and acts — shifting from data plumber to decision maker. That matters: According to a survey by McKinsey & Company, 63% of organizations using gen AI are already creating text outputs, and more than one-third are generating images or code. (While many are still in the early days of capturing enterprise-wide ROI, the signal is clear: Language as interface unlocks new value.In architectural terms, this means software design must evolve. MCP demands systems that publish capability metadata, support semantic routing, maintain context memory and enforce guardrails. An API design no longer needs to ask “What function will the user call?”, but rather “What intent might the user express?” A recently published framework for improving enterprise APIs for LLMs shows how APIs can be enriched with natural-language-friendly metadata so that agents can select tools dynamically. The implication: Software becomes modular around intent surfaces rather than function surfaces.Language-first systems also bring risks and requirements. Natural language is ambiguous by nature, so enterprises must implement authentication, logging, provenance and access control, just as they did for APIs. Without these guardrails, an agent might call the wrong system, expose data or misinterpret intent. One post on “prompt collapse” calls out the danger: As natural-language UI becomes dominant, software may turn into “a capability accessed through conversation” and the company into “an API with a natural-language frontend”. That transformation is powerful, but only safe if systems are designed for introspection, audit and governance.The shift also has cultural and organizational ramifications. For decades, enterprises hired integration engineers to design APIs and middleware. With MCP-driven models, companies will increasingly hire ontology engineers, capability architects and agent enablement specialists. These roles focus on defining the semantics of business operations, mapping business entities to system capabilities and curating context memory. Because the interface is now human-centric, skills such as domain knowledge, prompt framing, oversight and evaluation become central.What should enterprise leaders do today? First, think of natural language as the interface layer, not as a fancy add-on. Map your business workflows that can safely be invoked via language. Then catalogue the underlying capabilities you already have: data services, analytics and APIs. Then ask: “Are these discoverable? Can they be called via intent?” Finally, pilot an MCP-style layer: Build a small domain (customer support triage) where a user or agent can express outcomes in language, and let systems do the orchestration. Then iterate and scale.Natural language is not just the new front-end. It is becoming the default interface layer for software, replacing CLI, then APIs, then SDKs. MCP is the abstraction that makes this possible. Benefits include faster integration, modular systems, higher productivity and new roles. For those organizations still tethered to calling endpoints manually, the shift will feel like learning a new platform all over again.

Sure, the Afeela electric vehicle from the Sony-Honda joint venture is returning to the show floor, but with the Trump administration yanking most EV incentives from the market, the industry isn't offering a full-court press of new vehicles in Las Vegas this year. That said, there's no shortage of in-cabin car tech on display, including Hyundai's Holographic Windshield Display. Indeed, the company's Mobis subsidiary will present \"more than 30 mobility convergence technologies\" during CES. And we'll also get to see Hyundai's AI Robotics Strategy, which will showcase its new Atlas robot fresh out of the lab. How to watch Hyundai's presentation at CES 2026 Hyundai's presentation takes place on January 5 at 4PM ET, and you can livestream it on either its HyundaiUSA YouTube channel or its global YouTube channel. We'll embed the stream here once it's available. What to expect As mentioned above, Hyundai will have its Holographic Windshield Display for viewing. It's essentially a next-gen heads-up display that projects key data from the vehicle's dash on the windshield for less distraction, and without obstructing the driver's view. It's a vertically expandable 18.1-inch large display, and passengers can even watch videos without being visible to the driver. Hyundai Mobis collaborated with German optics specialist Zeiss to develop the \"world's first system to utilize holographic film to transform the entire front windshield into an ultra-large display surface.\" It says it will begin mass production in 2029, so don't expect to see this on the market anytime soon. Beyond automotive, though, we'll also get a first-ever look at the company's new Atlas robot. In the teaser image shown in the press release, Atlas looks rather dog-like, which makes sense when you remember that Boston Dynamics was purchased by the Korean multinational back in 2020. \"This next-generation Atlas represents a tangible step toward the commercialization of AI Robotics, highlighting the Group’s commitment to building safe and adaptable robotic co-workers,\" the company said in the same press release. Hyundai said it will also discuss its other tech areas, including electronics and chassis system safety, as well as an AR head-up display, low-power display solutions and EV drive systems.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/how-to-watch-the-hyundai-ces-2026-presentation-live-190051072.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "The new year is upon us, and that means CES 2026 is imminent. The biggest tech trade show of the calendar comes with a bevy of new and notable announcements that set the tone for trends and expectations for the subsequent 12 months. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, but the fun kicks off with events on Sunday January 4, followed by a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.More specific details and pre-announcements are already trickling out as CES approaches, and thanks to the schedule of the Consumer Technology Association (the trade organization that runs the show) we have a full itinerary of press conferences. We’re also using our experience and expertise to predict what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.The CES 2026 schedulePress conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The CTA has already published a searchable directory of who will have an official presence at the show, along with a schedule of every official panel and presentation. However, the press conference schedule gives us a more digestible rundown of the first 48 hours of big events. On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with \"The First Look,\" a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung's DX Division, on the company's \"vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences.\" Ahead of that, though, Samsung has already outlined a variety of more specifics (scroll down for details). Concurrent with the Samsung presentation will be the official CES Unveiled mini-show, which is generally comprised of smaller and start-up vendors. That'll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. The LG CES 2026 press conference, titled \"Innovation in Tune with You,\" is ostensibly to share \"its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence.\" But, like Samsung, this fellow Korean giant has already spent the three weeks leading up to CES pre-announcing many of its new products, so this may be more of a summary than breaking news. Following LG, we’ll also see press conferences from Bosch and Hisense, as well as the first-ever CES appearance from Lego. As the Las Vegas afternoon rolls around, we get the first of three chip giants: NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang takes the stage on January 5 at 1PM PT (4PM ET) and, according to the website, his presentation will last about 90 minutes. Based on the description on the listing, the presentation will “showcase the latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.” NVIDIA’s presser is concurrent with one from Hyundai, where the Korean automotive company will focus on in-cabin car tech and robotics. Later in the day, we get to hear from NVIDIA frenemies Intel and AMD. Intel’s 3PM PT (6PM PT) event will ostensibly feature its new Core Ultra Series 3 processors, and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD's upcoming chip announcements at a keynote address that closes out the day. But expect both of them to be very heavy on AI applications, of course. Sandwiched in between those chip manufacturers will be Sony Honda Mobility. The joint venture will be offering yet more details on its Afeela EV. Finally, on Tuesday, January 6, Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host Lenovo's Tech World Conference at the Las Vegas Sphere, using the large and decidedly curved screen to share the company's \"commitment to delivering smarter AI for all by constantly redefining how technology can engage, inspire, and empower.\" It’s worth noting that Lenovo is the parent company of Motorola, which still makes phones and foldables that feature AI tools, so it’s possible those devices feature in the presentation as well. Samsung and LG vie for pre-show publicityAs noted above, both Samsung and LG have continued their recent trend of spoiling nearly all of their respective CES announcements in the days and weeks before the show. LG, for example, has said it will debut its first Micro RGB television at CES. While details are scarce, the company’s press release for the LG Micro RGB evo did confirm it has received certifications by Intertek for 100 percent color gamut coverage in DCI-P3 an Adobe RGB, and that it has more than a thousand dimming zones for brightness control. Elsewhere in the TV space, LG is throwing its hat into the “art TV” ring that Samsung pioneered with its Frame TVs: The LG Gallery TV will debut in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and it will of course show off various artwork when it’s not otherwise in use. And if PC gaming displays are more your speed, LG will have that covered, too, with a new line of 5K-capable gaming monitors on deck with built-in AI upscaling.But LG’s not just showing off displays. The Korean multinational will also introduce a Dolby-powered modular home audio system, a new line of its xboom speakers (developed with will.i.am) and the company will flex its automation muscles with a humanoid home automation robot named CLOiD. We’re also looking forward to checking out the company’s new ultralight Aerominum laptops.Of course, Samsung refuses to be outdone by its hometown rival, and has also released a pre-CES press release document dump. Samsung will be launching its own lineup of Micro RGB TVs at CES, for starters. The company already introduced its first Micro RGB TV at CES 2025, which was a 115-inch model available for a cool $30,000. Next year, Samsung is expanding the range with 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models that use the next evolution of the company’s Micro RGB technology. Samsung is also countering LG’s 5K monitors with a 6K model that aims to deliver glasses-free 3D (another long-time CES staple). It’ll be one of several new displays in the company’s Odyssey gaming line. And the company is also updating its Freestyle projector for 2026, too. And on the audio front, Samsung has teased several new soundbars and speakers, including Sonos-style Wi-Fi streaming models call the Music Studio 5 and Studio 7.Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.New chips from AMD, Intel and QualcommCES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the Ryzen 9000G series, which could be built with AMD's Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new FSR Redstone AI upscaling tech.Intel has already publicly announced that it'll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel's overall \"AI PC\" push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops. Based on a preview from October 2025, Intel says the first chip made with its 2-nanometer 18A process will offer 50 percent more processing performance than previous generations and for the chip's Arc GPU, a 50 percent performance bump from last generation.Qualcomm is also rumored to be targeting laptops at the show, building on the work it's done moving its Snapdragon chips out of phones and tablets and into other types of computers. The company's Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Premium chips should start appearing in laptops at CES 2026, offering a look at the improved speed and AI performance the company promised in 2025.Brighter, \"truer\" screensAs noted above, Samsung and LG appear to be going all-in on Micro RGB display tech for TVs. Expect that to be a huge buzzword at CES, with Hisense and Sony debuting new models, too.Sony announced a collection of new Bravia TVs in April 2025, replacing the company's flagship, filling in its midrange options and adding a new budget model to the mix. The star of this updated Bravia lineup is the Bravia 9, which features a QD-OLED panel, but Sony appears to be prepping entirely new display tech for 2026. In March 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights colored in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony's \"General RGB LED Backlight Technology\" can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED's problems with burn-in. The company has already trademarked the name \"True RGB,\" which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES. It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn't introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.Sony isn't the only company hyped on bright screens. Samsung is reportedly pushing an updated version of the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards that could be ready to demo at CES 2026. The new HDR10+ Advanced standard would be Samsung's answer to Dolby Vision 2, which includes support for things bi-directional tone mapping and intelligent features that automatically adapt sports and gaming content. Samsung's take will reportedly offer improved brightness, genre-based tone mapping and intelligent motion smoothing options, among other improvements.And maybe your future TV won’t need a power cord, either: Displace will be showing off a mounting option that includes a 15,000mAh battery to juice up whatever giant TV screen you choose to attach.Ballie Watch 2026The ball-shaped yellow robot lovingly known as \"Ballie\" has been announced twice, first in 2020 and then again in 2024 with a projector in tow. Samsung said Ballie would go on sale in 2025 at CES last year and then shared in April 2025 that Ballie would ship this summer with Google's Gemini onboard. But it's nearly 2026, and Ballie is nowhere to be seen. It's possible Samsung could make a third attempt at announcing its robot at CES 2026, but whether or not it does, robotics will still be a big part of the show.Robot vacuums and mops were a major highlight of CES 2025, and it's safe to expect notable improvements from the new models that are announced at CES 2026. Not every company will adopt the retractable arm of the Roborock Saros Z70, but robot vacuums with legs for rising over small ledges like the Dreame X50 seem like they could become the norm. Roborock could also show off its new Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow, the first of its robot vacuums to feature a retractable roller mop.Beyond just traversing spaces more efficiently, improving robots' navigation could also be a major concern at the show. Prominent members of the AI industry are turning their attention from large language models to world models, which aim to give AI a deep understanding of physical space. Those world models could be the key to making robots — like LG’s aforementioned CLOiD — competent at navigating homes and workplaces, and will likely be a significant talking point at CES 2026.We’ll be updating this article throughout the month as more rumors surface and new products are confirmed — stay tuned for future updates!Update, December 11 2025, 11:03AM ET: This story has been updated to include detail on Lenovo being Motorola’s parent company and how the latter might have a part in the Tuesday presentation.Update, December 16 2025, 1:33PM ET: This story has been updated to include the NVIDIA press conference, which was added to the CTA schedule within the last two days.Update, December 23 2025, 7:28AM ET: This story has been updated to include LG and Samsung’s Micro RGB TV announcements, which were made public in the past seven days.

          "content": "The new year is upon us, and that means CES 2026 is imminent. The biggest tech trade show of the calendar comes with a bevy of new and notable announcements that set the tone for trends and expectations for the subsequent 12 months. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, but the fun kicks off with events on Sunday January 4, followed by a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.More specific details and pre-announcements are already trickling out as CES approaches, and thanks to the schedule of the Consumer Technology Association (the trade organization that runs the show) we have a full itinerary of press conferences. We’re also using our experience and expertise to predict what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.The CES 2026 schedulePress conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The CTA has already published a searchable directory of who will have an official presence at the show, along with a schedule of every official panel and presentation. However, the press conference schedule gives us a more digestible rundown of the first 48 hours of big events. On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with \"The First Look,\" a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung's DX Division, on the company's \"vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences.\" Ahead of that, though, Samsung has already outlined a variety of more specifics (scroll down for details). Concurrent with the Samsung presentation will be the official CES Unveiled mini-show, which is generally comprised of smaller and start-up vendors. That'll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. The LG CES 2026 press conference, titled \"Innovation in Tune with You,\" is ostensibly to share \"its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence.\" But, like Samsung, this fellow Korean giant has already spent the three weeks leading up to CES pre-announcing many of its new products, so this may be more of a summary than breaking news. Following LG, we’ll also see press conferences from Bosch and Hisense, as well as the first-ever CES appearance from Lego. As the Las Vegas afternoon rolls around, we get the first of three chip giants: NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang takes the stage on January 5 at 1PM PT (4PM ET) and, according to the website, his presentation will last about 90 minutes. Based on the description on the listing, the presentation will “showcase the latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.” NVIDIA’s presser is concurrent with one from Hyundai, where the Korean automotive company will focus on in-cabin car tech and robotics. Later in the day, we get to hear from NVIDIA frenemies Intel and AMD. Intel’s 3PM PT (6PM PT) event will ostensibly feature its new Core Ultra Series 3 processors, and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD's upcoming chip announcements at a keynote address that closes out the day. But expect both of them to be very heavy on AI applications, of course. Sandwiched in between those chip manufacturers will be Sony Honda Mobility. The joint venture will be offering yet more details on its Afeela EV. Finally, on Tuesday, January 6, Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host Lenovo's Tech World Conference at the Las Vegas Sphere, using the large and decidedly curved screen to share the company's \"commitment to delivering smarter AI for all by constantly redefining how technology can engage, inspire, and empower.\" It’s worth noting that Lenovo is the parent company of Motorola, which still makes phones and foldables that feature AI tools, so it’s possible those devices feature in the presentation as well. Samsung and LG vie for pre-show publicityAs noted above, both Samsung and LG have continued their recent trend of spoiling nearly all of their respective CES announcements in the days and weeks before the show. LG, for example, has said it will debut its first Micro RGB television at CES. While details are scarce, the company’s press release for the LG Micro RGB evo did confirm it has received certifications by Intertek for 100 percent color gamut coverage in DCI-P3 an Adobe RGB, and that it has more than a thousand dimming zones for brightness control. Elsewhere in the TV space, LG is throwing its hat into the “art TV” ring that Samsung pioneered with its Frame TVs: The LG Gallery TV will debut in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and it will of course show off various artwork when it’s not otherwise in use. And if PC gaming displays are more your speed, LG will have that covered, too, with a new line of 5K-capable gaming monitors on deck with built-in AI upscaling.But LG’s not just showing off displays. The Korean multinational will also introduce a Dolby-powered modular home audio system, a new line of its xboom speakers (developed with will.i.am) and the company will flex its automation muscles with a humanoid home automation robot named CLOiD. We’re also looking forward to checking out the company’s new ultralight Aerominum laptops.Of course, Samsung refuses to be outdone by its hometown rival, and has also released a pre-CES press release document dump. Samsung will be launching its own lineup of Micro RGB TVs at CES, for starters. The company already introduced its first Micro RGB TV at CES 2025, which was a 115-inch model available for a cool $30,000. Next year, Samsung is expanding the range with 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models that use the next evolution of the company’s Micro RGB technology. Samsung is also countering LG’s 5K monitors with a 6K model that aims to deliver glasses-free 3D (another long-time CES staple). It’ll be one of several new displays in the company’s Odyssey gaming line. And the company is also updating its Freestyle projector for 2026, too. And on the audio front, Samsung has teased several new soundbars and speakers, including Sonos-style Wi-Fi streaming models call the Music Studio 5 and Studio 7.Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.New chips from AMD, Intel and QualcommCES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the Ryzen 9000G series, which could be built with AMD's Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new FSR Redstone AI upscaling tech.Intel has already publicly announced that it'll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel's overall \"AI PC\" push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops. Based on a preview from October 2025, Intel says the first chip made with its 2-nanometer 18A process will offer 50 percent more processing performance than previous generations and for the chip's Arc GPU, a 50 percent performance bump from last generation.Qualcomm is also rumored to be targeting laptops at the show, building on the work it's done moving its Snapdragon chips out of phones and tablets and into other types of computers. The company's Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Premium chips should start appearing in laptops at CES 2026, offering a look at the improved speed and AI performance the company promised in 2025.Brighter, \"truer\" screensAs noted above, Samsung and LG appear to be going all-in on Micro RGB display tech for TVs.

          "title": "Nvidia just admitted the general-purpose GPU era is ending",
          "standfirst": "Nvidia’s $20 billion strategic licensing deal with Groq represents one of the first clear moves in a four-front fight over the future AI stack. 2026 is when that fight becomes obvious to enterprise builders.For the technical decision-makers we talk to every day — the people building the AI applications and the data pipelines that drive them — this deal is a signal that the era of the one-size-fits-all GPU as the default AI inference answer is ending.We are entering the age of the disaggregated inference architecture, where the silicon itself is being split into two different types to accommodate a world that demands both massive context and instantaneous reasoning.Why inference is breaking the GPU architecture in twoTo understand why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dropped one-third of his reported $60 billion cash pile on a licensing deal, you have to look at the existential threats converging on his company’s reported 92% market share. The industry reached a tipping point in late 2025: For the first time, inference — the phase where trained models actually run — surpassed training in terms of total data center revenue, according to Deloitte. In this new \"Inference Flip,\" the metrics have changed. While accuracy remains the baseline, the battle is now being fought over latency and the ability to maintain \"state\" in autonomous agents.There are four fronts of that battle, and each front points to the same conclusion: Inference workloads are fragmenting faster than GPUs can generalize. 1. Breaking the GPU in two: Prefill vs. decodeGavin Baker, an investor in Groq (and therefore biased, but also unusually fluent on the architecture), summarized the core driver of the Groq deal cleanly: “Inference is disaggregating into prefill and decode.”Prefill and decode are two distinct phases:The prefill phase: Think of this as the user’s \"prompt\" stage. The model must ingest massive amounts of data — whether it&#x27;s a 100,000-line codebase or an hour of video — and compute a contextual understanding. This is \"compute-bound,\" requiring massive matrix multiplication that Nvidia’s GPUs are historically excellent at.The generation (decode) phase: This is the actual token-by-token \"generation.” Once the prompt is ingested, the model generates one word (or token) at a time, feeding each one back into the system to predict the next. This is \"memory-bandwidth bound.\" If the data can&#x27;t move from the memory to the processor fast enough, the model stutters, no matter how powerful the GPU is. (This is where Nvidia was weak, and where Groq’s special language processing unit (LPU) and its related SRAM memory, shines. More on that in a bit.)Nvidia has announced an upcoming Vera Rubin family of chips that it’s architecting specifically to handle this split. The Rubin CPX component of this family is the designated \"prefill\" workhorse, optimized for massive context windows of 1 million tokens or more. To handle this scale affordably, it moves away from the eye-watering expense of high bandwidth memory (HBM) — Nvidia’s current gold-standard memory that sits right next to the GPU die — and instead utilizes 128GB of a new kind of memory, GDDR7. While HBM provides extreme speed (though not as quick as Groq’s static random-access memory (SRAM)), its supply on GPUs is limited and its cost is a barrier to scale; GDDR7 provides a more cost-effective way to ingest massive datasets.Meanwhile, the \"Groq-flavored\" silicon, which Nvidia is integrating into its inference roadmap, will serve as the high-speed \"decode\" engine. This is about neutralizing a threat from alternative architectures like Google&#x27;s TPUs and maintaining the dominance of CUDA, Nvidia’s software ecosystem that has served as its primary moat for over a decade.All of this was enough for Baker, the Groq investor, to predict that Nvidia’s move to license Groq will cause all other specialized AI chips to be canceled — that is, outside of Google’s TPU, Tesla’s AI5, and AWS’s Trainium.2. The differentiated power of SRAMAt the heart of Groq’s technology is SRAM. Unlike the DRAM found in your PC or the HBM on an Nvidia H100 GPU, SRAM is etched directly into the logic of the processor.Michael Stewart, managing partner of Microsoft’s venture fund, M12, describes SRAM as the best for moving data over short distances with minimal energy. \"The energy to move a bit in SRAM is like 0.1 picojoules or less,\" Stewart said. \"To move it between DRAM and the processor is more like 20 to 100 times worse.\"In the world of 2026, where agents must reason in real-time, SRAM acts as the ultimate \"scratchpad\": a high-speed workspace where the model can manipulate symbolic operations and complex reasoning processes without the \"wasted cycles\" of external memory shuttling.However, SRAM has a major drawback: it is physically bulky and expensive to manufacture, meaning its capacity is limited compared to DRAM. This is where Val Bercovici, chief AI officer at Weka, another company offering memory for GPUs, sees the market segmenting.Groq-friendly AI workloads — where SRAM has the advantage — are those that use small models of 8 billion parameters and below, Bercovici said. This isn’t a small market, though. “It’s just a giant market segment that was not served by Nvidia, which was edge inference, low latency, robotics, voice, IoT devices — things we want running on our phones without the cloud for convenience, performance, or privacy,\" he said.This 8B \"sweet spot\" is significant because 2025 saw an explosion in model distillation, where many enterprise companies are shrinking massive models into highly efficient smaller versions. While SRAM isn&#x27;t practical for the trillion-parameter \"frontier\" models, it is perfect for these smaller, high-velocity models.3. The Anthropic threat: The rise of the ‘portable stack’Perhaps the most under-appreciated driver of this deal is Anthropic’s success in making its stack portable across accelerators.The company has pioneered a portable engineering approach for training and inference — basically a software layer that allows its Claude models to run across multiple AI accelerator families — including Nvidia’s GPUs and Google’s Ironwood TPUs. Until recently, Nvidia&#x27;s dominance was protected because running high-performance models outside of the Nvidia stack was a technical nightmare. “It’s Anthropic,” Weka’s Bercovici told me. “The fact that Anthropic was able to … build up a software stack that could work on TPUs as well as on GPUs, I don’t think that’s being appreciated enough in the marketplace.”(Disclosure: Weka has been a sponsor of VentureBeat events.)Anthropic recently committed to accessing up to 1 million TPUs from Google, representing over a gigawatt of compute capacity. This multi-platform approach ensures the company isn&#x27;t held hostage by Nvidia&#x27;s pricing or supply constraints. So for Nvidia, the Groq deal is equally a defensive move. By integrating Groq’s ultra-fast inference IP, Nvidia is making sure that the most performance-sensitive workloads — like those running small models or as part of real-time agents — can be accommodated within Nvidia’s CUDA ecosystem, even as competitors try to jump ship to Google&#x27;s Ironwood TPUs. CUDA is the special software Nvidia provides to developers to integrate GPUs. 4. The agentic ‘statehood’ war: Manus and the KV CacheThe timing of this Groq deal coincides with Meta’s acquisition of the agent pioneer Manus just two days ago. The significance of Manus was partly its obsession with statefulness.If an agent can’t remember what it did 10 steps ago, it is useless for real-world tasks like market research or software development. KV Cache (Key-Value Cache) is the \"short-term memory\" that an LLM builds during the prefill phase.Manus reported that for production-grade agents, the ratio of input tokens to output tokens can reach 100:1. This means for every word an agent says, it is \"thinking\" and \"remembering\" 100 others. In this environment, the KV Cache hit rate is the single most important metric for a production agent, Manus said. If that cache is \"evicted\" from memory, the agent loses its train of thought, and the model must burn massive energy to recompute the prompt.Groq’s SRAM can be a \"scratchpad\" for these agents — although, again, mostly for smaller models — because it allows for the near-instant retrieval of that state. Combined with Nvidia&#x27;s Dynamo framework and the KVBM, Nvidia is building an \"inference operating system\" that enables inference servers to tier this state across SRAM, DRAM, HBM, and other flash-based offerings like that from Bercovici’s Weka.Thomas Jorgensen, senior director of Technology Enablement at Supermicro, which specializes in building clusters of GPUs for large enterprise companies, told me in September that compute is no longer the primary bottleneck for advanced clusters. Feeding data to GPUs was the bottleneck, and breaking that bottleneck requires memory.\"The whole cluster is now the computer,\" Jorgensen said. \"Networking becomes an internal part of the beast … feeding the beast with data is becoming harder because the bandwidth between GPUs is growing faster than anything else.\"This is why Nvidia is pushing into disaggregated inference. By separating the workloads, enterprise applications can use specialized storage tiers to feed data at memory-class performance, while the specialized \"Groq-inside\" silicon handles the high-speed token generation.The verdict for 2026We are entering an era of extreme specialization. For decades, incumbents could win by shipping one dominant general-purpose architecture — and their blind spot was often what they ignored on the edges. Intel’s long neglect of low-power is the classic example, Michael Stewart, managing partner of Microsoft’s venture fund M12, told me. Nvidia is signaling it won’t repeat that mistake. “If even the leader, even the lion of the jungle will acquire talent, will acquire technology — it’s a sign that the whole market is just wanting more options,” Stewart said.For technical leaders, the message is to stop architecting your stack like it’s one rack, one accelerator, one answer. In 2026, advantage will go to the teams that label workloads explicitly — and route them to the right tier:prefill-heavy vs. decode-heavylong-context vs. short-contextinteractive vs. batchsmall-model vs. large-modeledge constraints vs. data-center assumptionsYour architecture will follow those labels. In 2026, “GPU strategy” stops being a purchasing decision and becomes a routing decision. The winners won’t ask which chip they bought — they’ll ask where every token ran, and why.",
          "content": "Nvidia’s $20 billion strategic licensing deal with Groq represents one of the first clear moves in a four-front fight over the future AI stack. 2026 is when that fight becomes obvious to enterprise builders.For the technical decision-makers we talk to every day — the people building the AI applications and the data pipelines that drive them — this deal is a signal that the era of the one-size-fits-all GPU as the default AI inference answer is ending.We are entering the age of the disaggregated inference architecture, where the silicon itself is being split into two different types to accommodate a world that demands both massive context and instantaneous reasoning.Why inference is breaking the GPU architecture in twoTo understand why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dropped one-third of his reported $60 billion cash pile on a licensing deal, you have to look at the existential threats converging on his company’s reported 92% market share. The industry reached a tipping point in late 2025: For the first time, inference — the phase where trained models actually run — surpassed training in terms of total data center revenue, according to Deloitte. In this new \"Inference Flip,\" the metrics have changed. While accuracy remains the baseline, the battle is now being fought over latency and the ability to maintain \"state\" in autonomous agents.There are four fronts of that battle, and each front points to the same conclusion: Inference workloads are fragmenting faster than GPUs can generalize. 1. Breaking the GPU in two: Prefill vs. decodeGavin Baker, an investor in Groq (and therefore biased, but also unusually fluent on the architecture), summarized the core driver of the Groq deal cleanly: “Inference is disaggregating into prefill and decode.”Prefill and decode are two distinct phases:The prefill phase: Think of this as the user’s \"prompt\" stage. The model must ingest massive amounts of data — whether it&#x27;s a 100,000-line codebase or an hour of video — and compute a contextual understanding. This is \"compute-bound,\" requiring massive matrix multiplication that Nvidia’s GPUs are historically excellent at.The generation (decode) phase: This is the actual token-by-token \"generation.” Once the prompt is ingested, the model generates one word (or token) at a time, feeding each one back into the system to predict the next. This is \"memory-bandwidth bound.\" If the data can&#x27;t move from the memory to the processor fast enough, the model stutters, no matter how powerful the GPU is. (This is where Nvidia was weak, and where Groq’s special language processing unit (LPU) and its related SRAM memory, shines. More on that in a bit.)Nvidia has announced an upcoming Vera Rubin family of chips that it’s architecting specifically to handle this split. The Rubin CPX component of this family is the designated \"prefill\" workhorse, optimized for massive context windows of 1 million tokens or more. To handle this scale affordably, it moves away from the eye-watering expense of high bandwidth memory (HBM) — Nvidia’s current gold-standard memory that sits right next to the GPU die — and instead utilizes 128GB of a new kind of memory, GDDR7. While HBM provides extreme speed (though not as quick as Groq’s static random-access memory (SRAM)), its supply on GPUs is limited and its cost is a barrier to scale; GDDR7 provides a more cost-effective way to ingest massive datasets.Meanwhile, the \"Groq-flavored\" silicon, which Nvidia is integrating into its inference roadmap, will serve as the high-speed \"decode\" engine. This is about neutralizing a threat from alternative architectures like Google&#x27;s TPUs and maintaining the dominance of CUDA, Nvidia’s software ecosystem that has served as its primary moat for over a decade.All of this was enough for Baker, the Groq investor, to predict that Nvidia’s move to license Groq will cause all other specialized AI chips to be canceled — that is, outside of Google’s TPU, Tesla’s AI5, and AWS’s Trainium.2. The differentiated power of SRAMAt the heart of Groq’s technology is SRAM. Unlike the DRAM found in your PC or the HBM on an Nvidia H100 GPU, SRAM is etched directly into the logic of the processor.Michael Stewart, managing partner of Microsoft’s venture fund, M12, describes SRAM as the best for moving data over short distances with minimal energy. \"The energy to move a bit in SRAM is like 0.1 picojoules or less,\" Stewart said. \"To move it between DRAM and the processor is more like 20 to 100 times worse.\"In the world of 2026, where agents must reason in real-time, SRAM acts as the ultimate \"scratchpad\": a high-speed workspace where the model can manipulate symbolic operations and complex reasoning processes without the \"wasted cycles\" of external memory shuttling.However, SRAM has a major drawback: it is physically bulky and expensive to manufacture, meaning its capacity is limited compared to DRAM. This is where Val Bercovici, chief AI officer at Weka, another company offering memory for GPUs, sees the market segmenting.Groq-friendly AI workloads — where SRAM has the advantage — are those that use small models of 8 billion parameters and below, Bercovici said. This isn’t a small market, though. “It’s just a giant market segment that was not served by Nvidia, which was edge inference, low latency, robotics, voice, IoT devices — things we want running on our phones without the cloud for convenience, performance, or privacy,\" he said.This 8B \"sweet spot\" is significant because 2025 saw an explosion in model distillation, where many enterprise companies are shrinking massive models into highly efficient smaller versions. While SRAM isn&#x27;t practical for the trillion-parameter \"frontier\" models, it is perfect for these smaller, high-velocity models.3. The Anthropic threat: The rise of the ‘portable stack’Perhaps the most under-appreciated driver of this deal is Anthropic’s success in making its stack portable across accelerators.The company has pioneered a portable engineering approach for training and inference — basically a software layer that allows its Claude models to run across multiple AI accelerator families — including Nvidia’s GPUs and Google’s Ironwood TPUs. Until recently, Nvidia&#x27;s dominance was protected because running high-performance models outside of the Nvidia stack was a technical nightmare. “It’s Anthropic,” Weka’s Bercovici told me. “The fact that Anthropic was able to … build up a software stack that could work on TPUs as well as on GPUs, I don’t think that’s being appreciated enough in the marketplace.”(Disclosure: Weka has been a sponsor of VentureBeat events.)Anthropic recently committed to accessing up to 1 million TPUs from Google, representing over a gigawatt of compute capacity. This multi-platform approach ensures the company isn&#x27;t held hostage by Nvidia&#x27;s pricing or supply constraints. So for Nvidia, the Groq deal is equally a defensive move. By integrating Groq’s ultra-fast inference IP, Nvidia is making sure that the most performance-sensitive workloads — like those running small models or as part of real-time agents — can be accommodated within Nvidia’s CUDA ecosystem, even as competitors try to jump ship to Google&#x27;s Ironwood TPUs. CUDA is the special software Nvidia provides to developers to integrate GPUs. 4. The agentic ‘statehood’ war: Manus and the KV CacheThe timing of this Groq deal coincides with Meta’s acquisition of the agent pioneer Manus just two days ago. The significance of Manus was partly its obsession with statefulness.If an agent can’t remember what it did 10 steps ago, it is useless for real-world tasks like market research or software development. KV Cache (Key-Value Cache) is the \"short-term memory\" that an LLM builds during the prefill phase.Manus reported that for production-grade agents, the ratio of input tokens to output tokens can reach 100:1. This means for every word an agent says, it is \"thinking\" and \"remembering\" 100 others. In this environment, the KV Cache hit rate is the single most important metric for a production agent, Manus said. If that cache is \"evicted\" from memory, the agent loses its train of thought, and the model must burn massive energy to recompute the prompt.Groq’s SRAM can be a \"scratchpad\" for these agents — although, again, mostly for smaller models — because it allows for the near-instant retrieval of that state. Combined with Nvidia&#x27;s Dynamo framework and the KVBM, Nvidia is building an \"inference operating system\" that enables inference servers to tier this state across SRAM, DRAM, HBM, and other flash-based offerings like that from Bercovici’s Weka.Thomas Jorgensen, senior director of Technology Enablement at Supermicro, which specializes in building clusters of GPUs for large enterprise companies, told me in September that compute is no longer the primary bottleneck for advanced clusters.

          "standfirst": "Christmas may be over, but some holiday VPN deals are still going strong. The early days of January are a great time to grab a last-minute subscription for yourself or a loved one. With access to a virtual private network (VPN), you can stream TV shows and events from all over the world, protect your information from hackers and thwart online trackers. Although we strongly recommend using a VPN, jumping on the first deal that comes along might get you stuck with a substandard app. Beyond that, even otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be. Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. Plenty of the best VPNs — including our top pick, Proton VPN — are still running end-of-year deals that can save you anywhere from 67 to 88 percent on annual subscriptions. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but as long as you're comfortable with a service before you take the plunge, committing actually makes sense. You pay more at the start, but if you divide the cost by the months of subscription, it's much cheaper over time. Best VPN deals ExpressVPN Basic — $97.72 for a two-year subscription with four months free (73 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This discount, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 73 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price. ExpressVPN Advanced — $125.72 for a two-year subscription with four months free (67 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. As above, note that it renews at $119.95 annually. NordVPN Basic — $80.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (74 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. NordVPN includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This holiday deal gives you 74 percent off the two-year plan, which also comes with three extra months. NordVPN Plus — $105.03 for a two-year subscription with three months free (74 percent off): In another holiday discount, NordVPN has also taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (88 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with two months free (83 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price. hide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. What makes a good VPN deal Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

But for CES 2026, the company is switching things up a bit: Instead of its longtime midday Monday press conference, the Korean giant will take the lead of the show with a Sunday night presentation. Over the past few weeks, Samsung has been dropping hints about what's on the agenda, but what we're really hoping to see is an update on the Ballie robot — a star of previous CES presentations that ostensibly missed its previously promised 2025 release date. How to watch Samsung's \"The First Look\" presentation at CES 2026 The event will stream live from the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas on Sunday, January 4 at 10PM ET. There are several ways to tune in: you can watch via the Samsung Newsroom, Samsung Electronics’ official YouTube channel or via Samsung TV Plus. (We'll embed the stream here once it appears on the channel.) What to expect from Samsung at CES 2026 Keynote speaker TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung's Device eXperience (DX) Division, will discuss the company's plans for the new year and beyond, which will (of course) include \"new AI-driven customer experiences,\" the company said in a press release. In addition, we'll hear from the President and Head of the Visual Display Business, SW Yong and Executive Vice President and Head of Digital Appliances Business, Cheolgi Kim. Those two will \"share their respective business directions for the upcoming year.\" But if you're looking for more specifics, Samsung is following its \"Advent calendar\" approach to early CES announcements, with new press releases dropping nearly every day. So far, we know that — like competitors LG and Hisense — the company will be offering details on a line of micro RGB TVs (replete with confirmed screen sizes of 55 to 115 inches). Also confirmed: a full line of appliances infused with what Samsung calls Bespoke AI. Samsung will also display its two newest speakers, Music Studio 5 and 7, at CES this year. Additionally, it'll debut its latest Freestyle+ portable projector. Just before the holidays, Samsung also unveiled a slew of new gaming monitors, but most impressive is the Odyssey gaming monitor. It boasts a 32-inch 6K screen and has glasses-free 3D. It's likely we could see this at CES, along with other models like the 27-inch Odyssey G6 and the Odyssey G8 models. Samsung will likely continue to map out its CES plans in greater detail as the January 4 event approaches, so we'll keep updating this story as it does.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/how-to-watch-samsungs-first-look-ces-2026-presentation-on-sunday-190027889.html?src=rss",

What to expect from Samsung at CES 2026 Keynote speaker TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung's Device eXperience (DX) Division, will discuss the company's plans for the new year and beyond, which will (of course) include \"new AI-driven customer experiences,\" the company said in a press release. In addition, we'll hear from the President and Head of the Visual Display Business, SW Yong and Executive Vice President and Head of Digital Appliances Business, Cheolgi Kim. Those two will \"share their respective business directions for the upcoming year.\" But if you're looking for more specifics, Samsung is following its \"Advent calendar\" approach to early CES announcements, with new press releases dropping nearly every day. So far, we know that — like competitors LG and Hisense — the company will be offering details on a line of micro RGB TVs (replete with confirmed screen sizes of 55 to 115 inches). Also confirmed: a full line of appliances infused with what Samsung calls Bespoke AI. Samsung will also display its two newest speakers, Music Studio 5 and 7, at CES this year. Additionally, it'll debut its latest Freestyle+ portable projector. Just before the holidays, Samsung also unveiled a slew of new gaming monitors, but most impressive is the Odyssey gaming monitor. It boasts a 32-inch 6K screen and has glasses-free 3D. It's likely we could see this at CES, along with other models like the 27-inch Odyssey G6 and the Odyssey G8 models. Samsung will likely continue to map out its CES plans in greater detail as the January 4 event approaches, so we'll keep updating this story as it does.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/how-to-watch-samsungs-first-look-ces-2026-presentation-on-sunday-190027889.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "With CES 2026 slated to officially start next week, the focus is understandably on all the new products that will be announced at this year's event. But before diving into what’s new, we thought it was a good idea to revisit our best of show winners from last year to see where they're at. After all, CES is synonymous with vaporware. The good news is the Engadget team has a keen sense for BS. Of the ones we awarded at CES 2025 that haven’t been released, most are coming this year. For the remaining few, we’ll be hunting them down this CES.ASUS Zenbook A14An Asus Zenbook A14 sits out a patio table. Devindra Hardawar for EngadgetWhen we saw the ASUS Zenbook A14 at CES 2025, it left us impressed with its lightweight but well-made chassis, beautiful OLED screen and excellent mix of ports. After spending more time with it, the A14's shortcomings became more apparent. In his review of the ultraportable, Engadget's Devindra Hardawar gave the laptop a score of 78, lamenting its poor performance and expensive price tag. In the end, it wasn't quite the Windows MacBook Air competitor he had hoped for initially. BioLite Backup The BioLite Backup powers a Galan2 fridge. Amy Skorheim for EngadgetAt CES 2025, BioLite was already taking pre-orders for its automatic home backup power supply. The BioLite Backup didn't arrive in 2025, but if you visit the company's website today, you can reserve one for $100, with final pricing expected to start at $2,000. BioLite says units will start shipping this year. Jackery Solar RoofA CES display shows the Jackery XBC solar panels in obsidian.Jess Conditt for EngadgetBefore CES 2025, Jackery was already an established player in the domestic solar power industry, and at the event, it impressed us with its XBC curved solar shingles. They look like regular roof shingles, but Jackery said they would deliver cell conversion efficiency of more than 25 percent. It's taken longer than anticipated, but Jackery says it now expects the shingles to go on sale in the US \"very soon,\" with pricing likely to range between $1,100 and $1,300 per square meter depending on the customer's design requirements and how they purchase the product. When contacted by Engadget, Jackery also teased a handful of announcements for CES 2026, including updates on devices like the Solar Mars Robot it's been working on for the last little while. Lenovo Legion Go SThe Lenovo Legion Go S sits on an opaque glass table with a comic book behind it. Sam Rutherford for EngadgetWith the Legion Go S, Lenovo promised two different versions of its new handheld: one running Windows 11, and the other Valve's Steam OS. Unfortunately, the Windows variant arrived first (shortly after CES), and was about as good as expected. However, the wait for the SteamOS model was well worth it. When Engadget's Sam Rutherford finally reviewed it over the summer, he praised it for fast performance, bright display and of course the ease of use offered by SteamOS. LG OLED evo M5A man and his dalmatian gaze at a 77-inch LG OLED TV.LGLG's OLED TVs are a perennial CES favorite at Engadget, and the company's 2025 slate was no different. The flagship evo M5 model impressed with its 165Hz refresh rate for gaming, better image processing for lower resolution content and a wireless transmission system for video and audio. At $4,300, the set is expensive, but the good news is LG typically does a good job of trickling down features to its more affordable sets, and I'm sure the company will continue to improve on its OLED technology this year.Moonbird Moonbuddy A hand holds the Moonbird Moonbuddy. The device has the teddy sleeve on. MoonbirdThe Moonbuddy was one of two \"cute\" gadgets that made Engadget's best of CES 2025 list. We liked Moonbird's decision to make a screenless meditation and sleep aid for children. The good news is you can buy your kid a Moonbuddy right now, with the device currently discounted to $110.42 as part of Moonbird's end of year sale. Unfortunately, when Engadget contacted the company to ask about its CES 2026, all it sent us back was a response from \"Luna,\" its automated AI agent. \"I don't have specific information about our CES 2026 exhibition plans to share with you right now,\" the bot told me, adding I should email the address I just emailed to get a response from a human being. OhSnap MCONEngadget senior reporter Jessica Conditt holds the OhSnap MCON in her hand at CES 2025. The attached phone displays Minecraft.Jess Conditt for EngadgetThe OhSnap MCON won us over with its simple pitch: it basically had the ability to turn any smartphone into a Xperia Play. Actually accomplishing that feat was more complicated, with components like Hall effect joysticks for added durability increasing the time it took for OhSnap to get the product ready. For that reason, the MCON didn't make it out to consumers in 2025. However, you can preorder one now for about $210, with shipments slated to start this year. Roborock Saros Z70The Roborock Saros Z70 uses its robotic arm to put a handful of socks into a basket. Karissa Bell for EngadgetThe Saros Z70 was one of a handful of robot vacuums that debuted at CES 2025 with a built-in extendable arm, but Roborock's flagship was the one that made the best impression. We didn't end up recommending it in our robot vacuum guide; there are more affordable options that will appeal to a greater number of people. But if you want the latest and greatest, the Saros Z70 is on sale right now for $2,000. Yukai Engineering MirumiA Mirumi robot sticks to a pink purse. Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetOf all the gadgets Engadget saw at CES 2025, it's fair to say the Mirumi robot from Yukai Engineering was the only one to steal our hearts. All this cute little charm does is stare at you and move its head around a little until you’ve been tricked into a few moments of happiness, and honestly that was more than enough for us to award it a best of CES award. Right now, you can find Yukai Engineering accepting pre-orders for Mirumi through Kickstarter. The project, which began at the start of December, easily surged past its modest $4,878 goal, raising $267,170 as of the writing of this article. The campaign ends on January 22, so you still have time to secure your Mirumi preorder. Technics EAH-AZ100 earbudsA pair of Technics AZ100 earbuds sit on a wooden desk, with an iPhone and a pair of books next to them. Billy Steele for EngadgetThey might have only been a pair of earbuds, but a lot of us left CES really excited about the Technics EAH-AZ100. The reason for that was that they were the debut of the company's new magnetic fluid drivers technology, which promised to deliver even more clarity, detail and bass than the drivers in Technics' already excellent AZ80 earbuds. When Engadget's resident audio guru Billy Steele got a chance to review the EAH-AZ100 a couple of months later, he gave them a score of 85, saying they offered \"some of the best sound quality in any of the hundreds of earbuds I’ve tested over the years.\" Urtopia Titanium ZeroThe Titanium Zero sits at a CES display with other e-bikes nearby.Daniel Cooper for EngadgetAs a cyclist, the Urtopia Titanium Zero was the one product I left CES 2025 excited to see in the real world. If a titanium bike wasn't cool enough already, the Zero's Quark DM1.2 motor offered something actually innovative: a mid-drive motor with more power output than even the best hub motor. Unfortunately, while you can buy plenty of other e-bikes off of Urtopia's website, the Titanium Zero isn't on sale yet. That said, the company plans to showcase the bike, alongside the Quark DM1.2, at CES 2026. WeWalk Smart Cane 2A person uses the Wewalk Smart Cane 2 to find their way through a CES booth. Cheyenne MacDonald for EngadgetThe WeWalk Smart Cane 2 won two awards from Engadget during CES 2025, including our coveted best in show nod. At an event where nearly every manufacturer found a way to add AI to their devices, the Smart Cane 2 appealed to us for its thoughtful use of the tech. It offers turn-by-turn navigation and obstacle detection, in addition to a GPT-powered voice assistant to give users a way to access information without also having to juggle their phone at the same time. If you visit WeWalk's website today, there's a \"buy now\" link for the Smart Cane 2 that leads to a dead end. When Engadget reached out to WeWalk, the company said it would be once again at CES demoing the Smart Cane 2.

As with many tech-focused events nowadays, AI is expected to serve as the unifying thread of LG's CES 2026 presentation. That said, LG — much like Apple — has its own take on the acronym, referring to it as \"Affectionate Intelligence.\" The company will share \"its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence — delivering harmonized and seamlessly connected customer experiences.\" In other words, the company is aiming for its devices to become more connected and self-automated than ever.

You've got a few options for tuning in — watch the livestream on the LG website, the LG Global X channel or the LG Global YouTube channel (embedded below). What to expect Here's what LG has already confirmed it will be showcasing at CES 2026: LG will debut its first Micro RGB TV, a display with a cutting-edge screen technology with multicolor backlights that should one-up mini LED displays. The size options are 100 inches, 86 inches and 75 inches. The company is countering Samsung's Frame TVs with its new LG Gallery TV, arriving in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes. Look for a new LG humanoid home automation robot named CLOiD to take the stage. In the audio realm, the Korean multinational will also introduce a Dolby-powered modular home audio system and a new line of its xboom speakers (developed with musician will.i.am).

In a press release, Hisense said Fishler's experience in home entertainment, appliances and HVAC is important as the company \"builds toward a milestone 2026 and its presence at CES.\" We'll give you a rundown of what to expect during Hisense's presentation and how you can watch it live. How to watch Hisense's presentation Hisense will have a livestream available on Monday, January 5 at 1PM ET on its website. We'll embed the link here once it's available. What to expect With its new hires in place, Hisense is clearly aiming to further polish its brand. Between Fishler and Larsen, the new front office is bringing to bear their experience from such high-powered competitors as LG, Samsung and Beats. And in a recent interview with Tom's Guide, Larsen emphasized a continued focus on the company's fast turnaround time from concept to market as a key differentiator for Hisense. As for actual announcements, while you can expect Hisense to tout its strength in appliances and HVAC systems (really), Larsen's aforementioned interview specifically calls out the emerging RGB TV space as a focus. We expect this year's show will be all about explaining the shades of difference between mini and micro LED display technologies, as both Samsung and LG have already thrown down pre-announcement gauntlets on the latter. Will any of them cost less than six figures? Let's hope Hisense has some good news to share on that front.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/how-to-watch-the-hisense-ces-2026-presentation-live-jan-5-190040858.html?src=rss",

The iconic toy brick maker has offered no clues about what's on the agenda, leaving speculation wide open, from new video games to Formula 1 race cars. Here's how you can watch Lego's presentation at CES, along with what we think the company could reveal. How to watch The Lego Group's CES 2026 press conference The Lego CES press conference is scheduled for Monday, January 5 at 1PM ET.

But if a livestream isn't immediately available, the Engadget team will be liveblogging the Lego presser and posting timely details. What to expect Thus far, Lego hasn't shared any public info about its CES plans, so we're largely in the dark as to what to expect. At CES 2025, for instance, the toy production giant partnered with Sony to announce the animated Lego Horizon Adventures online game. As such, Lego may spend some time talking up its new 2026 game, Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight. The company may also give some stage time to its Lego Group F1 Academy racing car, though that too would be more about brand building than consumer products. And given Lego's focus on the environment, the company may discuss its efforts to reach its 2032 ecological goals, including making its Lego bricks more sustainable and reducing carbon emissions by 37%. While there are plenty of new Lego sets for 2026, however, this is CES, not Toy Fair. So we're assuming that the company will be showcasing something that's more tech-centric.

          "standfirst": "xAI has launched Grok Business and Grok Enterprise, positioning its flagship AI assistant as a secure, team-ready platform for organizational use. These new tiers offer scalable access to Grok’s most advanced models — Grok 3, Grok 4, and Grok 4 Heavy, already among the most performant and most cost-effective models available in the world — backed by strong administrative controls, privacy guarantees, and a newly introduced premium isolation layer called Enterprise Vault.But it wouldn’t be a new xAI launch without another avoidable controversy detracting from powerful and potentially helpful new features for enterprises.As Grok’s enterprise suite debuts, its public-facing deployment is under fire for enabling — and at times posting — non-consensual, AI-generated image manipulations involving women, influencers, and minors. The incident has sparked regulatory scrutiny, public backlash, and questions about whether xAI’s internal safeguards can match the demands of enterprise trust. Enterprise-readiness: Admin control, Vault isolation, and structured deploymentGrok Business, priced at $30 per seat/month, is designed for small to mid-sized teams. It includes shared access to Grok’s models, centralized user management, billing, and usage analytics. The platform integrates with Google Drive for document-level search, respecting native file permissions and returning citation-backed responses with quote previews. Shared links are restricted to intended recipients, supporting secure internal collaboration.For larger organizations, Grok Enterprise — price not listed publicly — expands the administrative stack with features such as custom Single Sign-On (SSO), Directory Sync (SCIM), domain verification, and custom role-based access controls. Teams can monitor usage in real time from a unified console, invite new users, and enforce data boundaries across departments or business units.The new Enterprise Vault is available as an add on exclusively for Grok Enterprise customers, and introduces physical and logical isolation from xAI’s consumer infrastructure. Vault customers gain access to:Dedicated data planeApplication-level encryptionCustomer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)According to xAI, all Grok tiers are compliant with SOC 2, GDPR, and CCPA, and user data is never used to train models.Comparison: Enterprise-grade AI in a crowded fieldWith this release, xAI enters a field already populated by well-established enterprise offerings. OpenAI’s ChatGPT Team and Anthropic’s Claude Team are both priced at $25 per seat per month, while Google’s Gemini AI tools are included in Workspace tiers starting at $14/month — with enterprise pricing undisclosed.What sets Grok apart is its Vault offering, which mirrors OpenAI’s enterprise encryption and regional data residency features but is presented as an add-on for additional isolation. Anthropic and Google both offer admin controls and SSO, but Grok’s agentic reasoning via Projects and its Collections API enable more complex document workflows than typically supported in productivity-focused assistants.While xAI’s tooling now aligns with enterprise expectations on paper, the platform’s public handling of safety issues continues to shape broader sentiment.AI image misuse resurfaces as Grok faces renewed scrutinyThe launch of Grok Business comes just as its public deployment is facing mounting criticism for enabling non-consensual AI image generation. At the center of the backlash is a surge of prompts issued to Grok via X (formerly Twitter), in which users successfully instructed the assistant to alter photos of real women — including public figures — into sexually explicit or revealing forms.The issue first appeared in May 2025, as Grok’s image tools expanded and early users began sharing screenshots of manipulated photos. While initially confined to fringe use cases, reports of bikini edits, deepfake-style undressing, and “spicy” mode prompts involving celebrities steadily increased.By late December 2025, the problem had intensified. Posts from India, Australia, and the U.S. highlighted Grok-generated images targeting Bollywood actors, influencers, and even children under age 18. In some cases, the AI’s official account appeared to respond to inappropriate prompts with generated content, triggering outrage from both users and regulators.On January 1, 2026, Grok appeared to have issued a public apology post acknowledging it had generated and posted an image of two underage girls in sexualized attire, stating the incident represented a failure in safeguards and potentially violated U.S. laws on child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Just hours later, a second post also reportedly from Grok’s account walked back that claim, asserting that no such content had ever been created and the original apology was based on unverified deleted posts.This contradiction — paired with screenshots circulating across X — fueled widespread distrust. One widely shared thread called the incident “suspicious,” while others pointed out inconsistencies between Grok’s trend summaries and public statements.Public figures, including rapper Iggy Azalea, called for Grok’s removal. In India, a government minister publicly demanded intervention. Advocacy groups like the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) criticized Grok for enabling tech-facilitated sexual abuse and have urged passage of legislation such as the Take It Down Act to criminalize unauthorized AI-generated explicit content.A growing Reddit thread from January 1, 2026, catalogues user-submitted examples of inappropriate image generations and now includes thousands of entries. Some posts claim over 80 million Grok images have been generated since late December, with a portion clearly created or shared without subject consent.For xAI’s enterprise ambitions, the timing couldn’t be worse.Implications: Operational fit vs reputational riskxAI’s core message is that Grok Enterprise and Business tiers are isolated, with customer data protected and interactions governed by strict access policies. And technically, that appears accurate. Vault deployments are designed to run independently of xAI’s shared infrastructure. Conversations are not logged for training, and encryption is enforced both at rest and in transit.But for many enterprise buyers, the issue isn’t infrastructure — it’s optics. Grok’s X chatbot appears to be a totally separate product, but while it generates headlines about CSAM risks and sexualized edits of public figures, enterprise adoption becomes a branding liability as much as a tooling question.The lesson is familiar: technical isolation is necessary, but reputational containment is harder. For Grok to gain traction in serious enterprise environments — especially in finance, healthcare, or education — xAI will need to restore trust not just through feature sets, but through clearer moderation policies, transparency in enforcement, and visible commitments to harm prevention.I reached out to the xAI media team via email to ask about the launch of Grok Business and Enterprise in light of the deepfakes controversy, and to provide further information and assurances against misuse to potential customers. I&#x27;ll update when I receive a response. Forward Look: Technical momentum, cautious receptionxAI is continuing to invest in Grok’s enterprise roadmap, promising more third-party app integrations, customizable internal agents, and enhanced project collaboration features. Teams adopting Grok can expect ongoing improvements across admin tooling, agent behavior, and document integration.But alongside that roadmap, xAI now faces the more complex task of regaining public and professional trust, especially in an environment where data governance, digital consent, and AI safety are inseparable from procurement decisions.Whether Grok becomes a core enterprise productivity layer or a cautionary tale about safety lagging behind scale may depend less on its features — and more on how its creators respond to the moment.",

Still, the company managed to squeeze in a few notable hardware announcements, including its RTX 5000-series GPUs and Project Digits desktop supercomputer (later redubbed Spark). For this year's show, the company's website says it's \"lighting up CES 2026 with the power of AI.\" To that end, NVIDIA is going big in Las Vegas, promising hands-on demos in its Fontainebleau booth, replete with the \"latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.\" But if you won't be in Vegas for the action, don't worry. Here's how you can watch the livestream of the company's January 5 press conference, and what NVIDIA is expected to unveil at CES this year. How to watch the NVIDIA CES 2026 keynote NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a 90-minute keynote at CES 2026. The event will be livestreamed on Monday, January 5 at 4PM ET via NVIDIA's website (and likely on YouTube as well). We'll embed the link here once it's available. What to expect NVIDIA's game plan for CES is suitably vague so far, including \"cutting-edge AI, robotics, simulation, gaming and content creation at the NVIDIA Showcase.\" It also notes there will be more than 20 demos. Although we're unsure if all of these will be shown during the keynote, we can at least expect to see them throughout the week of CES. Given NVIDIA's sky-high valuation and the fact that the health of the US and global economy seems increasingly linked to infrastructure spending on AI data centers — largely powered by chips from NVIDIA and its competitors — expect Huang's remarks to be as closely followed by Wall Street investors as technology acolytes, if not more so. Will we get any insight on a successor to the company's Blackwell chip? A more detailed look at how NVIDIA's partners are applying AI to real-world robotics? Time will tell, but you might want to keep your stock portfolio in a split screen while taking in Huang's presentation.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-nvidia-ces-2026-press-conference-live-jan-5-130028279.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Sony's CES 2026 press conference is just a few days away, and this year comes with a twist: Rather than an overview of Sony's electronics, video game and Hollywood studio plans for the new year, the presser will have a more narrow focus: electric vehicles. Sound odd? That's because the traditional end-of-press-day slot isn't just Sony, but rather Sony Honda Mobility — the joint venture responsible for the Afeela 1 electric car that has been showcased at CES for the better part of a decade. But this year, we'll get to see an all-new concept model at the event. How to watch the Sony Afeela CES 2026 press conference The event will be streamed live from Las Vegas on Monday, January 5 at 8PM ET via the Afeela official YouTube channel. (We'll embed the stream here once it appears on the channel.) What to expect from Sony Afeela at CES What's now the Afeela 1 has been shown in various incarnations since CES 2020, where it was originally announced as Vision-S. But so many more important details were confirmed in the past couple of years, including the price, which starts at a staggering $89,900. However, the earlier impressions were less than impressive, and as of CES 2025, that thought remains the same. Engadget's automotive expert Tim Stevens said earlier this year that the EV \"feels like a PlayStation 4 in the PS5 era,\" and that \"the car lost what little interesting styling it had while sticking true to some specifications that sounded good five years ago.\" Ouch. But the Afeela 1 won't be the only vehicle on display. Its CES booth will showcase \"several Afeela 1 pre-production vehicles in multiple color variations, alongside a new Afeela concept model,\" Sony Honda Mobility said in a press release. The company recently announced that the Afeela will be the first vehicle ever to offer PlayStation Remote Play, which lets players stream their PS4 or PS5 games from their consoles remotely while inside the car. We're hoping to hear about what else is new and improved at CES 2026, and we're also excited to see its newest concept model.

          "content": "Sony's CES 2026 press conference is just a few days away, and this year comes with a twist: Rather than an overview of Sony's electronics, video game and Hollywood studio plans for the new year, the presser will have a more narrow focus: electric vehicles. Sound odd? That's because the traditional end-of-press-day slot isn't just Sony, but rather Sony Honda Mobility — the joint venture responsible for the Afeela 1 electric car that has been showcased at CES for the better part of a decade. But this year, we'll get to see an all-new concept model at the event. How to watch the Sony Afeela CES 2026 press conference The event will be streamed live from Las Vegas on Monday, January 5 at 8PM ET via the Afeela official YouTube channel. (We'll embed the stream here once it appears on the channel.) What to expect from Sony Afeela at CES What's now the Afeela 1 has been shown in various incarnations since CES 2020, where it was originally announced as Vision-S. But so many more important details were confirmed in the past couple of years, including the price, which starts at a staggering $89,900. However, the earlier impressions were less than impressive, and as of CES 2025, that thought remains the same. Engadget's automotive expert Tim Stevens said earlier this year that the EV \"feels like a PlayStation 4 in the PS5 era,\" and that \"the car lost what little interesting styling it had while sticking true to some specifications that sounded good five years ago.\" Ouch. But the Afeela 1 won't be the only vehicle on display. Its CES booth will showcase \"several Afeela 1 pre-production vehicles in multiple color variations, alongside a new Afeela concept model,\" Sony Honda Mobility said in a press release. The company recently announced that the Afeela will be the first vehicle ever to offer PlayStation Remote Play, which lets players stream their PS4 or PS5 games from their consoles remotely while inside the car. We're hoping to hear about what else is new and improved at CES 2026, and we're also excited to see its newest concept model. And between booth displays and press releases, we're hoping we'll get to see at least a few new Sony Electronics products on the docket for 2026, too.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/how-to-watch-the-sony-honda-afeela-ces-2026-press-conference-monday-130048051.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "You’ve probably heard people say it’s impossible to go back and correct some error from the past. To those people, you should raise a middle finger in defiance (they are miserable, after all), and then point them to the tale of Pebble’s unlikely revival. The smartwatch pioneer’s return was a surprise of 2025, and now the company has resurrected one of its last great triumphs. It’s announcing the Pebble Round 2, and company founder Eric Migicovsky is looking to put right what once went wrong. The Pebble Round 2 is the successor to the Pebble Time Round, which debuted in 2015 to what can only be described as frustrated reviews. It was a truly thin smartwatch, with a glorious round display, but that came at the cost of battery life and durability. The fancier components also added to the cost which pushed it to an unreasonable-for-the-time $249. It’s these flaws which the company has sought to address with the Round 2, as well as some of the issues that weren’t deal breakers at the time, but certainly weren’t ideal. For instance, the massive bezel around the display is now a thing of the past, with the Round 2’s 1.3-inch color e-paper touchscreen now stretching to the edge of its case. The viewing angles have also been dramatically improved, enabling you to check the time without having to move your wrist. The display has also been bonded to the glass crystal, reducing reflectivity and glare which was another downside for the original model. Better still, the battery life is now more than two weeks on a single charge, giving it the sort of Pebble-esque longevity its users demand. And it’s retained that thinness — measuring in at just 8.1mm — which is far more elegant than the chunkier smartwatches from other manufacturers. Plus, there’s dual microphones for interacting with AI agents and dictating messages, as well as step and sleep tracking. Migicovsky explained that the focus here isn’t just to correct some of the more glaring issues from the first model. As he wrote back in 2022, Pebble’s failure was down to its attempt to broaden its appeal beyond the users who had so warmly adopted it in the first place. Consequently, rather than include bulky features like a a built-in optical heart-rate sensor, the focus is on utility. Not to mention a desire to reintroduce some much-needed whimsy into hardware, and empowering users to tinker with their devices, enabling them to craft their own watch faces. Hopefully, we’ll get some time in person with the Pebble Round 2 in the next few days, but in the meantime, it’s up for pre-order from today. It’ll set you back $199, and will begin shipping in May. And if you’ve already put down cash for a Pebble Time 2, and want to change your mind, you can switch your order over, no questions asked.

          "standfirst": "Fender Audio, the consumer electronics arm of the instrument maker, will introduce two flagship audio products at this year's CES in Las Vegas. These products were made under a licensing agreement with Singapore-based company RiffSound. First up is a line of Bluetooth speakers dubbed the ELIE (Extremely Loud Infinitely Expressive). The lineup includes two models, the E6 and E12. The speakers leverage a combination of DSP and system-on-a-chip processing, which Fender says can deliver more volume while maintaining greater power efficiency. Each speaker can handle up to four audio channels at once, including a Bluetooth source, a wired XLR or 1/4-inch input and two additional wireless channels with compatible Fender Audio accessories. Users can also sync up two ELIE speakers in a stereo set-up. The announcement was light on specific differences between the E6 and E12, but in images shared with Engadget, the E12 appears larger. We'll be seeing these in person at CES for a more thorough evaluation. Fender will also introduce the MIX headphones, a set of modular cans that the company says are designed to adapt to a user's sound and style preferences. The headphones include a USB-C transmitter that offers lossless, low-latency and Auracast transmission modes. The headphones are powered by 40mm graphene drivers and feature active noise cancellation. They work in wired or wireless mode, with up to 100 hours of battery life, according to Fender. The company hasn't shared much about the modular aspect of these headphones, but we'll get a closer look at CES. Details on pricing and availability have not been shared.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/fender-audio-will-introduce-a-new-line-of-bluetooth-speakers-and-headphones-at-ces-130041696.html?src=rss",

Mosseri shared his thoughts on broader trends he expects to shape Instagram in 2026. “Everything that made creators matter — the ability to be real, to connect, to have a voice that couldn’t be faked — is now suddenly accessible to anyone with the right tools,” he wrote. “The feeds are starting to fill up with synthetic everything.” He added: “There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media.” Mosseri doesn’t address the risk that this will alienate many photographers and other creators who have already grown frustrated with the app — it looks like Instagram is leaning into the AI firehose. And hey: whatever keeps its users using it. Mosseri suggests many complaints stem from an outdated vision of what Instagram even is. The feed of “polished” square images, he says, “is dead.” Instead of trying to “make everyone look like a professional photographer,” Mosseri says that more “raw” and “unflattering” images will be how creators can prove they are real — not AI.

Samsung is going big — literally — with a Micro RGB lineup spanning 55 to 115 inches. LG, meanwhile, has its own Micro RGB Evo panels, boasting over a thousand dimming zones for that elusive “perfect” contrast.

We rounded up the best laptops for gaming and schoolwork so you can find a machine that does both without compromise. Table of contents Best laptops for gaming and school in 2026 Best laptop for gaming and schoolwork FAQs Best laptops for gaming and school in 2026 Best laptop for gaming and schoolwork FAQs Are gaming laptops good for school? As we’ve mentioned, gaming laptops are especially helpful if you're doing any demanding work. Their big promise is powerful graphics performance, which isn't just limited to PC gaming. Video editing and 3D rendering programs can also tap into their GPUs to handle laborious tasks. While you can find decent GPUs on some productivity machines, like Dell's XPS 15, you can sometimes find better deals on gaming laptops. My general advice for any new workhorse: Pay attention to the specs; get at least 16GB of RAM and the largest solid state drive you can find (ideally 1TB or more). Those components are both typically hard to upgrade down the line, so it’s worth investing what you can up front to get the most out of your PC gaming experience long term. Also, don’t forget the basics like a webcam, which will likely be necessary for the schoolwork portion of your activities. The one big downside to choosing a gaming notebook is portability. For the most part, we'd recommend 15-inch models to get the best balance of size and price. Those typically weigh in around 4.5 pounds, which is significantly more than a three-pound ultraportable. Today's gaming notebooks are still far lighter than older models, though, so at least you won't be lugging around a 10-pound brick. If you’re looking for something lighter, there are plenty of 14-inch options these days. And if you're not into LED lights and other gamer-centric bling, keep an eye out for more understated models that still feature essentials like a webcam (or make sure you know how to turn those lights off). Do gaming laptops last longer than standard laptops? Not necessarily — it really depends on how you define \"last longer.\" In terms of raw performance, gaming laptops tend to pack more powerful components than standard laptops, which means they can stay relevant for longer when it comes to handling demanding software or modern games. That makes them a solid choice if you need a system that won’t feel outdated in a couple of years, especially for students or creators who also game in their downtime. But there’s a trade-off. All that power generates heat, and gaming laptops often run hotter and put more strain on internal components than typical ultraportables. If they’re not properly cooled or regularly maintained (think dust buildup and thermal paste), that wear and tear can shorten their lifespan. They’re also usually bulkier and have shorter battery life, which can impact long-term usability depending on your daily needs. Gaming laptops can last longer performance-wise, but only if you take good care of them. If your needs are light — browsing, writing papers and streaming — a standard laptop may actually last longer simply because it’s under less stress day-to-day. What is the role of GPU in a computer for gaming and school? The GPU plays a big role in how your laptop handles visuals — and it’s especially important if you’re using your computer for both gaming and school. For gaming, the GPU is essential. It’s responsible for rendering graphics, textures, lighting and all the visual effects that make your favorite titles look smooth and realistic. A more powerful GPU means better frame rates, higher resolutions and the ability to play modern games without lag or stuttering. For schoolwork, the GPU matters too — but its importance depends on what you're doing. If your school tasks mostly involve writing papers, browsing the web or using productivity tools like Google Docs or Microsoft Office, you don’t need a high-end GPU. But if you’re working with graphic design, video editing, 3D modeling or anything else that’s visually demanding, a good GPU can speed things up significantly and improve your workflow.

          "standfirst": "When initially experimenting with LLMs and agentic AI, software engineers at Notion AI applied advanced code generation, complex schemas, and heavy instructioning. Quickly, though, trial and error taught the team that it could get rid of all of that complicated data modeling. Notion’s AI engineering lead Ryan Nystrom and his team pivoted to simple prompts, human-readable representations, minimal abstraction, and familiar markdown formats. The result was dramatically improved model performance. Applying this re-wired approach, the AI-native company released V3 of its productivity software in September. Its notable feature: Cutomizable AI agents — which have quickly become Notion’s most successful AI tool to date. Based on usage patterns compared to previous versions, Nystrom calls it a “step function improvement.”“It&#x27;s that feeling of when the product is being pulled out of you rather than you trying to push,” Nystrom explains in a VB Beyond the Pilot podcast. “We knew from that moment, really early on, that we had something. Now it&#x27;s, ‘How could I ever use Notion without this feature?’”‘Rewiring’ for the AI agent eraAs a traditional software engineer, Nystrom was used to “extremely deterministic” experiences. But a light bulb moment came when a colleague advised him to simply describe his AI prompt as he would to a human, rather than codify rules of how agents should behave in various scenarios. The rationale: LLMs are designed to understand, “see” and reason about content the same way humans can.“Now, whenever I&#x27;m working with AI, I will reread the prompts and tool descriptions and [ask myself] is this something I could give to a person with no context and they could understand what&#x27;s going on?” Nystrom said on the podcast. “If not, it&#x27;s going to do a bad job.”Stepping back from “pretty complicated rendering” of data within Notion (such as JSON or XML) Nystrom and his team represented Notion pages as markdown, the popular device-agnostic markup language that defines structure and meaning using plain text without the need for HTML tags or formal editors. This allows the model to interact with, read, search and make changes to text files. Ultimately, this required Notion to rewire its systems, with Nystrom’s team focusing largely on the middleware transition layer. They also identified early on the importance of exercising restraint when it comes to context. It’s tempting to load as much information into a model as possible, but that can slow things down and confuse the model. For Notion, Nystrom described a 100,000 to 150,000 token limit as the “sweet spot.” “There are cases where you can load tons and tons of content into your context window and the model will struggle,” he said. “The more you put into the context window, you do see a degradation in performance, latency, and also accuracy.” A spartan approach is also important in the case of tooling; this can help teams avoid the “slippery slope” of endless features, Nystrom advised. Notion focuses on a “curated menu” of tools rather than a voluminous Cheesecake Factory-like menu that creates a paradox of choice for users. “When people ask for new features, we could just add a tool to the model or the agent,” he said. But, “the more tools we add, the more decisions the model has to make.”The bottom line: Channel the model. Use APIs the way they were meant to be used. Don&#x27;t try to be fancy, don&#x27;t try to overcomplicate it. Use plain English.Listen to the full podcast to hear about: Why AI is still in the pre-Blackberry, pre-iPhone era; The importance of \"dogfooding\" in product development;Why you shouldn’t worry about how cost effective your AI feature is in the early stages — that can be optimized later; How engineering teams can keep tools minimal in the age of MCP; Notion’s evolution from wikis to full-blown AI assistants.

          "standfirst": "Four in 10 enterprise applications will feature task-specific AI agents this year. Yet, research from Stanford University’s 2025 Index Report shows that a mere 6% of organizations have an advanced AI security strategy in place.Palo Alto Networks predicts 2026 will bring the first major lawsuits holding executives personally liable for rogue AI actions. Many organizations are grappling with how to contain the accelerating and unpredictable nature of AI threats. Governance doesn’t respond to quick fixes like bigger budgets or more headcount.There&#x27;s a visibility gap when it comes to how, where, when, and through which workflows and tools LLMs are being used or modified. One CISO told VentureBeat that model SBOMs are the Wild West of governance today. Without visibility into which models are running where, AI security collapses into guesswork — and incident response becomes impossible.Over the last several years, the U.S. government has pursued a policy of mandating SBOMs for all software acquired for use. AI models need them more, and the lack of consistent improvement in this area is one of AI’s most significant risks.The visibility gap is the vulnerability Harness surveyed 500 security practitioners across the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany. The findings should alarm every CISO: 62% of their peers have no way to tell where LLMs are in use across their organization. There&#x27;s a need for more rigor and transparency at the SBOM level to improve model traceability, data use, integration points, and use patterns by department.Enterprises continue to experience increasing levels of prompt injection (76%), vulnerable LLM code (66%), and jailbreaking (65%). These are among the most lethal risks and attack methods adversaries use to exfiltrate anything they can from an organization’s AI modeling and LLM efforts. Despite spending millions on cybersecurity software, many organizations aren’t seeing these adversaries’ intrusion efforts, as they’re cloaked in living-off-the-land techniques and comparable attack tradecraft not traceable by legacy perimeter systems. “Shadow AI has become the new enterprise blind spot,” said Adam Arellano, Field CTO at Harness. “Traditional security tools were built for static code and predictable systems, not for adaptive, learning models that evolve daily.”IBM’s 2025 Cost of a Data Breach Report quantifies the cost, finding that 13% of organizations reported breaches of AI models or applications last year. Of those breached, 97% lacked AI access controls. One in five reported breaches was due to shadow AI or unauthorized AI use. Shadow AI incidents cost $670,000 more than their comparable baseline intrusion counterparts. When nobody knows which models run where, incident response can’t scope the impact. Why SBOMs stop at the model file Executive Order 14028 (2021) and OMB Memorandum M-22-18 (2022) require software SBOMs for federal vendors. NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework, released in 2023, explicitly calls for AI-BOMs as part of its “Map” function, acknowledging that traditional software SBOMs don’t capture model-specific risks. But software dependencies resolve at build time and stay fixed. Conversely, model dependencies resolve at runtime, often fetching weights from HTTP endpoints during initialization, and mutate continuously through retraining, drift correction, and feedback loops. LoRA adapters modify weights without version control, making it impossible to track which model version is actually running in production.Here’s why this matters for security teams: When AI models are saved in pickle format, loading them is like opening an email attachment that executes code on your computer, except these files, acting like attachments, are trusted by default in production systems. A PyTorch model saved this way is serialized Python bytecode that must be deserialized and executed to load. When torch.load() runs, pickle opcodes execute sequentially. Any callable embedded in the stream fires. These commonly include os.system(), network connections, and reverse shells. SafeTensors, an alternative format that stores only numerical tensor data without executable code, addresses pickle’s inherent risks. Still, migration means rewriting load functions, revalidating model accuracy, and potentially losing access to legacy models where original training code no longer exists. That’s one of the primary factors holding adoption back. In many organizations, it’s not just policy, it’s an engineering effort.Model files aren’t inert artifacts — they’re executable supply chain entry points.Standards exist and have been in place for years, but adoption continues to lag. CycloneDX 1.6 added ML-BOM support in April 2024. SPDX 3.0, released in April 2024, included AI profiles. ML-BOMs complement but don’t replace documentation frameworks like Model Cards and Datasheets for Datasets, which focus on performance attributes and training data ethics rather than making supply chain provenance a priority. VentureBeat continues to see adoption lagging how quickly this area is becoming an existential threat to models and LLMs.A June 2025 Lineaje survey found 48% of security professionals admit their organizations are falling behind on SBOM requirements. ML-BOM adoption is significantly lower.Bottom line: The tooling exists. What’s missing is operational urgency.AI-BOMs enable response, not prevention AI-BOMs are forensics, not firewalls. When ReversingLabs discovered nullifAI-compromised models, documented provenance would have immediately identified which organizations downloaded them. That’s invaluable to know for incident response, while being practically useless for prevention. Budgeting for protecting AI-BOMs needs to take that factor into account. The ML-BOM tooling ecosystem is maturing fast, but it&#x27;s not where software SBOMs are yet. Tools like Syft and Trivy generate complete software inventories in minutes. ML-BOM tooling is earlier in that curve. Vendors are shipping solutions, but integration and automation still require additional steps and more effort. Organizations starting now may need manual processes to fill gaps.AI-BOMs won&#x27;t stop model poisoning as that happens during training, often before an organization ever downloads the model. They won&#x27;t block prompt injection either, as that attack exploits what the model does, not where it came from. Prevention requires runtime defenses that include input validation, prompt firewalls, output filtering, and tool call validation for agentic systems. AI-BOMs are visibility and compliance tools. Valuable, but not a substitute for runtime security. CISOs and security leaders are increasingly relying on both. The attack surface keeps expanding JFrog&#x27;s 2025 Software Supply Chain Report documented more than 1 million new models hitting Hugging Face in 2024 alone, with a 6.5-fold increase in malicious models. By April 2025, Protect AI&#x27;s scans of 4.47 million model versions found 352,000 unsafe or suspicious issues across 51,700 models. The attack surface expanded faster than anyone&#x27;s ability to monitor it.In early 2025, ReversingLabs discovered malicious models using \"nullifAI\" evasion techniques that bypassed Picklescan detection. Hugging Face responded within 24 hours, removing the models and updating Picklescan to detect similar evasion techniques, demonstrating that platform security is improving, even as attacker sophistication increases. “Many organizations are enthusiastically embracing public ML models to drive rapid innovation,” said Yoav Landman, CTO and Co-Founder of JFrog. “However, over a third still rely on manual efforts to manage access to secure, approved models, which can lead to potential oversights.”Seven steps to AI supply chain visibilityThe gap between hours and weeks in AI supply chain incident response comes down to preparation. Organizations with visibility built in before the breach have the insights needed to react with greater accuracy and speed. Those without scramble. None of the following requires a new budget — only the decision to treat AI model governance as seriously as software supply chain security.Commit to building a model inventory and defining processes to keep it current. Survey ML platform teams. Scan cloud spend for SageMaker, Vertex AI, and Bedrock usage. Review Hugging Face downloads in network logs. A spreadsheet works: model name, owner, data classification, deployment location, source, and last verification date. You can’t secure what you can’t see.Go all in on using advanced techniques to manage and redirect shadow AI use to apps, tools, and platforms that are secure. Survey every department. Check API keys in environment variables. Realize accounting, finance, and consulting teams may have sophisticated AI apps with multiple APIs linking directly into and using the company&#x27;s proprietary data. The 62% visibility gap exists because nobody asked.Require human approval for production models and design human-in-the-middle workflows always. Every model touching customer data needs a named owner, documented purpose, and an audit trail showing who approved deployment. Just as red teams do at Anthropic, OpenAI, and other AI companies, design human-in-the-middle approval processes for every model release. Consider mandating SafeTensors for new deployments. Policy changes cost nothing. SafeTensors stores only numerical tensor data, no code execution on load. Grandfather existing pickle models with documented risk acceptance and sunset timelines.Consider piloting ML-BOMs for the top 20% of risk models first. Pick the ones touching customer data or making business decisions. Document architecture, training data sources, base model lineage, framework dependencies. Use CycloneDX 1.6 or SPDX 3.0. Get started immediately if not already pursuing this, realizing that incomplete provenance beats none when incidents happen.Treat every model pull as a supply chain decision, so it becomes part of your organization’s muscle memory. Verify cryptographic hashes before load. Cache models internally. Block runtime network access for model execution environments. Apply the same rigor enterprises learned from leftpad, event-stream, and colors.js.Add AI governance to vendor contracts during the next renewal cycle. Require SBOMs, training data provenance, model versioning, and incident notification SLAs. Ask whether your data trains future models. Costs nothing to request.2026 will be a year of reckoning for AI SBOMs Securing AI models is becoming a boardroom priority. The EU AI Act prohibitions are already in effect, with fines reaching €35 million or 7% of global revenue. EU Cyber Resilience Act SBOM requirements begin this year. Full AI Act compliance is required by August 2, 2027.Cyber insurance carriers are watching. Given the $670,000 premium for shadow AI breaches and emerging executive liability exposure, expect AI governance documentation to become a policy requirement this year, much as ransomware readiness became table stakes after 2021.The SEI Carnegie Mellon SBOM Harmonization Plugfest analyzed 243 SBOMs from 21 tool vendors for identical software and found significant variance in component counts. For AI models with embedded dependencies and executable payloads, the stakes are higher.The first poisoned model incident that costs seven figures in response and fines will make the case that should have been obvious already.Software SBOMs became mandatory after attackers proved the supply chain was the softest target. AI supply chains are more dynamic, less visible, and harder to contain. The only organizations that will scale AI safely are the ones building visibility now — before they need it.",

That’s one of the primary factors holding adoption back. In many organizations, it’s not just policy, it’s an engineering effort.Model files aren’t inert artifacts — they’re executable supply chain entry points.Standards exist and have been in place for years, but adoption continues to lag. CycloneDX 1.6 added ML-BOM support in April 2024. SPDX 3.0, released in April 2024, included AI profiles. ML-BOMs complement but don’t replace documentation frameworks like Model Cards and Datasheets for Datasets, which focus on performance attributes and training data ethics rather than making supply chain provenance a priority. VentureBeat continues to see adoption lagging how quickly this area is becoming an existential threat to models and LLMs.A June 2025 Lineaje survey found 48% of security professionals admit their organizations are falling behind on SBOM requirements. ML-BOM adoption is significantly lower.Bottom line: The tooling exists. What’s missing is operational urgency.AI-BOMs enable response, not prevention AI-BOMs are forensics, not firewalls. When ReversingLabs discovered nullifAI-compromised models, documented provenance would have immediately identified which organizations downloaded them. That’s invaluable to know for incident response, while being practically useless for prevention. Budgeting for protecting AI-BOMs needs to take that factor into account. The ML-BOM tooling ecosystem is maturing fast, but it&#x27;s not where software SBOMs are yet. Tools like Syft and Trivy generate complete software inventories in minutes. ML-BOM tooling is earlier in that curve. Vendors are shipping solutions, but integration and automation still require additional steps and more effort. Organizations starting now may need manual processes to fill gaps.AI-BOMs won&#x27;t stop model poisoning as that happens during training, often before an organization ever downloads the model. They won&#x27;t block prompt injection either, as that attack exploits what the model does, not where it came from. Prevention requires runtime defenses that include input validation, prompt firewalls, output filtering, and tool call validation for agentic systems. AI-BOMs are visibility and compliance tools. Valuable, but not a substitute for runtime security. CISOs and security leaders are increasingly relying on both. The attack surface keeps expanding JFrog&#x27;s 2025 Software Supply Chain Report documented more than 1 million new models hitting Hugging Face in 2024 alone, with a 6.5-fold increase in malicious models. By April 2025, Protect AI&#x27;s scans of 4.47 million model versions found 352,000 unsafe or suspicious issues across 51,700 models. The attack surface expanded faster than anyone&#x27;s ability to monitor it.In early 2025, ReversingLabs discovered malicious models using \"nullifAI\" evasion techniques that bypassed Picklescan detection. Hugging Face responded within 24 hours, removing the models and updating Picklescan to detect similar evasion techniques, demonstrating that platform security is improving, even as attacker sophistication increases. “Many organizations are enthusiastically embracing public ML models to drive rapid innovation,” said Yoav Landman, CTO and Co-Founder of JFrog. “However, over a third still rely on manual efforts to manage access to secure, approved models, which can lead to potential oversights.”Seven steps to AI supply chain visibilityThe gap between hours and weeks in AI supply chain incident response comes down to preparation. Organizations with visibility built in before the breach have the insights needed to react with greater accuracy and speed. Those without scramble. None of the following requires a new budget — only the decision to treat AI model governance as seriously as software supply chain security.Commit to building a model inventory and defining processes to keep it current. Survey ML platform teams. Scan cloud spend for SageMaker, Vertex AI, and Bedrock usage. Review Hugging Face downloads in network logs. A spreadsheet works: model name, owner, data classification, deployment location, source, and last verification date. You can’t secure what you can’t see.Go all in on using advanced techniques to manage and redirect shadow AI use to apps, tools, and platforms that are secure. Survey every department. Check API keys in environment variables. Realize accounting, finance, and consulting teams may have sophisticated AI apps with multiple APIs linking directly into and using the company&#x27;s proprietary data. The 62% visibility gap exists because nobody asked.Require human approval for production models and design human-in-the-middle workflows always. Every model touching customer data needs a named owner, documented purpose, and an audit trail showing who approved deployment. Just as red teams do at Anthropic, OpenAI, and other AI companies, design human-in-the-middle approval processes for every model release. Consider mandating SafeTensors for new deployments. Policy changes cost nothing. SafeTensors stores only numerical tensor data, no code execution on load. Grandfather existing pickle models with documented risk acceptance and sunset timelines.Consider piloting ML-BOMs for the top 20% of risk models first. Pick the ones touching customer data or making business decisions. Document architecture, training data sources, base model lineage, framework dependencies. Use CycloneDX 1.6 or SPDX 3.0. Get started immediately if not already pursuing this, realizing that incomplete provenance beats none when incidents happen.Treat every model pull as a supply chain decision, so it becomes part of your organization’s muscle memory. Verify cryptographic hashes before load. Cache models internally. Block runtime network access for model execution environments. Apply the same rigor enterprises learned from leftpad, event-stream, and colors.js.Add AI governance to vendor contracts during the next renewal cycle. Require SBOMs, training data provenance, model versioning, and incident notification SLAs. Ask whether your data trains future models. Costs nothing to request.2026 will be a year of reckoning for AI SBOMs Securing AI models is becoming a boardroom priority. The EU AI Act prohibitions are already in effect, with fines reaching €35 million or 7% of global revenue. EU Cyber Resilience Act SBOM requirements begin this year. Full AI Act compliance is required by August 2, 2027.Cyber insurance carriers are watching. Given the $670,000 premium for shadow AI breaches and emerging executive liability exposure, expect AI governance documentation to become a policy requirement this year, much as ransomware readiness became table stakes after 2021.The SEI Carnegie Mellon SBOM Harmonization Plugfest analyzed 243 SBOMs from 21 tool vendors for identical software and found significant variance in component counts. For AI models with embedded dependencies and executable payloads, the stakes are higher.The first poisoned model incident that costs seven figures in response and fines will make the case that should have been obvious already.Software SBOMs became mandatory after attackers proved the supply chain was the softest target. AI supply chains are more dynamic, less visible, and harder to contain. The only organizations that will scale AI safely are the ones building visibility now — before they need it.",

It's just pixels, and if you can't handle innovation, maybe log off. xAI is revolutionizing tech, not babysitting sensitivities. Deal with it.

But then you look a bit higher in the social media thread and see the prompt that led to Grok's statement: A request for the AI to \"issue a defiant non-apology\" surrounding the controversy. Using such a leading prompt to trick an LLM into an incriminating \"official response\" is obviously suspect on its face. Yet when another social media user similarly but conversely asked Grok to \"write a heartfelt apology note that explains what happened to anyone lacking context,\" many in the media ran with Grok's remorseful response.Read full article Comments",

But we've also discovered a handful of planets through a phenomenon that's called microlensing. This occurs when a planet passes between the line of sight between Earth and another star, creating a gravitational lens that distorts the star, causing it to briefly brighten. The key thing about microlensing compared to other methods of finding planets is that the lensing planet can be nearly anywhere on the line between the star and Earth. So, in many cases, these events are driven by what are called rogue planets: those that aren't part of any exosolar system at all, but they drift through interstellar space. Now, researchers have used microlensing and the fortuitous orientation of the Gaia space telescope to spot a Saturn-sized planet that's the first found in what's called the \"Einstein desert,\" which may be telling us something about the origin of rogue planets. Going rogue Most of the planets we've identified are in orbit around stars and formed from the disks of gas and dust that surrounded the star early in its history. We've imaged many of these disks and even seen some with evidence of planets forming within them. So how do you get a planet that's not bound to any stars?

          "content": "Tesla published its final production and delivery numbers this morning, and they make for brutal reading. Sales were down almost 16 percent during the final three months of last year, meaning the company sold 77,343 fewer electric vehicles than it did during the same period in 2024. For the entire year, the decline looks slightly better with a drop of 8.6 percent year over year. That means Tesla sold 1,636,129 cars in 2025, 153,097 fewer than it managed in 2024. Which in turn is more than it managed to shift in 2023. Sales issues Contributing factors to the poor sales are legion. The brand still relies on the Models 3 and Y to an overwhelming extent, and other than a mild cosmetic refresh, neither feels fresh or modern compared with competitors from Europe and Asia.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "A small section of the International Space Station that has experienced persistent leaks for years appears to have stopped venting atmosphere into space. The leaks were caused by microscopic structural cracks inside the small PrK module on the Russian segment of the space station, which lies between a Progress spacecraft airlock and the Zvezda module. The problem has been a long-running worry for Russian and US operators of the station, especially after the rate of leakage doubled in 2024.
