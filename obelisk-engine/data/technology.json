          "content": "Tesla shareholders voted Thursday to approve Elon Musk’s staggering new pay package, in a move aimed at retaining the controversial CEO’s leadership during a time of great upheaval for the automaker. Over 75 percent of shares voted in favor of the proposal. The vote gives Musk enormous sway over his electric vehicle company, as well as awards him with the largest corporate payout in history. The final tally is expected to be disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in a few days. Musk took the stage at the shareholder meeting in Austin to chants of “Elon! Elon!” and flanked by dancing Optimus robots. “What we’re about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,” he said. The proposed pay package, which was put forward by the board last September, would award Musk more than 423 million additional shares, increasing his stake to about 25 percent from its current level of 15 percent. In order to receive the full compensation, Musk would need to achieve a series of milestones, including raising Tesla’s market capitalization from its current $1.5 trillion to $8.5 trillion in 10 years. Musk must also put into service 1 million robotaxis and sell 12 million more cars, 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions, and 1 million humanoid robots. In the run-up to the vote, Tesla warned shareholders that a failure to approve the enormous payout would risk losing Musk to other endeavors. The compensation package is aimed at luring him back to the EV company, even though Musk seems more motivated by the idea of creating — and controlling — a “robot army.” Musk would need to achieve a series of milestones, including raising Tesla’s market capitalization from its current $1.5 trillion to $8.5 trillion in 10 years. The vote was opposed by some of Tesla’s largest shareholders, including Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, as well as some smaller public pension funds, such as the American Federation of Teachers and various New York City retirement systems. Major proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have also come out against the pay proposal. Musk’s current compensation package, valued at more than $50 billion, was invalidated by a Delaware court last year after a judge found that Tesla’s board lacked sufficient independence from the billionaire CEO. Shareholders had voted twice to approve the hefty compensation, but the judge still upheld her ruling blocking it. Tesla has appealed the decision to the Delaware Supreme Court. The ruling spurred Musk to engineer a proposal to move Tesla’s legal home from Delaware to Texas, which shareholders also approved. The new award comes as the board continues to push the message that Tesla is on the cusp of becoming a leader in AI and robotics, requiring Musk’s steady hand on the helm. In reality, Tesla’s position is shakier than ever. Musk’s support for President Donald Trump and his work at the Department of Government Efficiency to fire tens of thousands of federal workers and cancel humanitarian aid programs spawned a nationwide protest movement and a steep drop in sales. The expiration of the federal EV tax credit is expected to lead to an even further drop in sales. Whether Musk can achieve these audacious goals set out in the pay package seems increasingly at odds with his approach to the technology. Tesla rolled out its first robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, earlier this year — although the service fell short of Musk’s earlier predictions. The cars still all feature safety monitors, either in the driver or passenger seat — though Musk has said they could be removed by the end of the year. The company’s only new product since 2020, the Cybertruck, has widely been considered a consumer flop. And competition from other automakers, especially those in China, has been shrinking Tesla’s market share and sapping its resources.",

Before that, Rockstar planned to release the game in 2025. It will be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S. “When we set a date, we really do believe in it,” Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick tells The Game Business. “We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time.

Last week, Rockstar was accused of union busting after firing 30 to 40 employees. A Rockstar spokesperson told Bloomberg that it took action against a “small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum” and that “this was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”",

          "standfirst": "Engadget It doesn't look like Disney-owned channels including ABC and ESPN will be returning to YouTube TV anytime soon. The Walt Disney Co. pulled its channels from YouTube TV as of midnight on Oct. 30 after the two companies failed to reach new terms on their latest carriage agreement and the spat is showing no signs of a resolution yet. While big sporting events are often where the rubber meets the road on these channel blackouts, YouTube TV subscribers were unable to see any college football games on ABC or ESPN all weekend, and it's looking like this weekend will be just as frustrating for sports fans. YouTube TV had previously stated that if Disney’s channels remain off the platform for an extended period, customers will receive a $20 monthly credit. YouTube has confirmed this credit hasn't been activated yet for customers, but if and when it is, the discount provides little consolation if you want to watch this weekend's college games or your favorite shows like Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and Dancing with the Stars the night they air. If you do want to watch any live shows or sports this week, you'll need to seek out alternative viewing methods. And unfortunately for YouTube TV's negotiating position, there are plenty of options. One of the cheapest ways to watch ESPN is with a Sling Day Pass — for just $5/day, you can tune into any and all ESPN programming with no other commitments. If you want a full switch from YouTube TV, there's Hulu + Live TV, DirecTV, or Fubo, where you can watch all the Disney-owned channels. (Remember, unlike a lot of cable plans, you can easily pause or cancel YouTube TV or any of these alternatives, so long as you have month-to-month subscriptions.) Below, we've outlined some of your best options to watch ESPN, the Disney Channel, ABC and more, all pulled from our list of best live TV streaming services to cut cable, as well as a comprehensive list of which channels have been affected, and the biggest sporting events of the week that won't be available to YouTube TV subscribers. What games are on ESPN/ABC this week? If you're wondering what games you might miss as a result of the YouTubeTV/Disney blackout, here's a list of some upcoming sports you may not want to miss: College Football Thursday, Nov. 6 7:30 p.m. | Georgia Southern at Appalachian State | ESPN2 7:30 p.m. | UTSA at South Florida | ESPN Friday, Nov. 7 9 p.m. | Tulane at Memphis | ESPN Saturday, Nov. 8 12 p.m. | No. 5 Georgia at Mississippi State | ESPN 12 p.m. | No. 7 BYU at No. 8 Texas Tech | ABC 12 p.m. | SMU at Boston College | ACC Network 12 p.m. | James Madison at Marshall | ESPN2 12 p.m. | Southern Miss at Arkansas State | ESPNU 3:30 p.m. | No. 3 Texas A&M at No. 22 Missouri | ABC 3:30 p.m. | Syracuse at No. 18 Miami (Fla.) | ESPN 3:30 p.m. | Kansas at Arizona | ESPN2 4 p.m. | Auburn at No. 16 Vanderbilt | SEC Network 4 p.m. | Kennesaw State at New Mexico State | ESPN+ 4 p.m. | Georgia State at Coastal Carolina | ESPN+ 5 p.m. | Texas State at Louisiana | ESPN+ 7 p.m. | Wake Forest at No. 14 Virginia | ESPN 7 p.m. | Cal at No. 15 Louisville | ESPN2 7 p.m. | Florida State at Clemson | ACCN 7:30 p.m. | LSU at No. 4 Alabama | ABC 7:30 p.m. | Florida at Kentucky | SEC Network NFL Monday, Nov. 10 8:15 p.m. | Philadelphia Eagles vs. Green Bay Packers | ESPN/ABC Grab an ESPN bundle so you won't miss the NFL, NBA or any other games Get Hulu + Live TV at a great price Try Fubo free for a week and get $30 your first month Try DirecTV free for 5 days, and get $30 off your first month What about Sling \"day passes\"? You may have heard that Sling offers day, weekend and week passes to its streaming programming for as little as $5 per day. That is an option if you're looking for just some of the ESPN channels (the Sling Orange tier), but ABC isn't included. (If you're just looking to catch one of this week's big games, like Monday Night Football on ESPN, it's a great short-term solution.) If you want a longer-term solution, you can get both ESPN and ABC with Sling's Orange and Blue package ($30 a month to start, $61 thereafter), but you'll need to add on the Sports Extra package for ESPNU, which requires an additional charge.

          "content": "Engadget It doesn't look like Disney-owned channels including ABC and ESPN will be returning to YouTube TV anytime soon. The Walt Disney Co. pulled its channels from YouTube TV as of midnight on Oct. 30 after the two companies failed to reach new terms on their latest carriage agreement and the spat is showing no signs of a resolution yet. While big sporting events are often where the rubber meets the road on these channel blackouts, YouTube TV subscribers were unable to see any college football games on ABC or ESPN all weekend, and it's looking like this weekend will be just as frustrating for sports fans. YouTube TV had previously stated that if Disney’s channels remain off the platform for an extended period, customers will receive a $20 monthly credit. YouTube has confirmed this credit hasn't been activated yet for customers, but if and when it is, the discount provides little consolation if you want to watch this weekend's college games or your favorite shows like Abbott Elementary, Grey's Anatomy and Dancing with the Stars the night they air. If you do want to watch any live shows or sports this week, you'll need to seek out alternative viewing methods. And unfortunately for YouTube TV's negotiating position, there are plenty of options.

You can designate a specific contact and on which app you want to be able to contact them.During its Connect event, Meta previewed some updates for third-party apps that appear to allow developers to set their own wake words for the glasses when using their services.

          "standfirst": "Even as concern and skepticism grows over U.S. AI startup OpenAI&#x27;s buildout strategy and high spending commitments, Chinese open source AI providers are escalating their competition and one has even caught up to OpenAI&#x27;s flagship, paid proprietary model GPT-5 in key third-party performance benchmarks with a new, free model. The Chinese AI startup Moonshot AI’s new Kimi K2 Thinking model, released today, has vaulted past both proprietary and open-weight competitors to claim the top position in reasoning, coding, and agentic-tool benchmarks. Despite being fully open-source, the model now outperforms OpenAI’s GPT-5, Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Thinking mode), and xAI&#x27;s Grok-4 on several standard evaluations — an inflection point for the competitiveness of open AI systems.Developers can access the model via platform.moonshot.ai and kimi.com; weights and code are hosted on Hugging Face. The open release includes APIs for chat, reasoning, and multi-tool workflows.Users can try out Kimi K2 Thinking directly through its own ChatGPT-like website competitor and on a Hugging Face space as well. Modified Standard Open Source LicenseMoonshot AI has formally released Kimi K2 Thinking under a Modified MIT License on Hugging Face.The license grants full commercial and derivative rights — meaning individual researchers and developers working on behalf of enterprise clients can access it freely and use it in commercial applications — but adds one restriction:\"If the software or any derivative product serves over 100 million monthly active users or generates over $20 million USD per month in revenue, the deployer must prominently display &#x27;Kimi K2&#x27; on the product’s user interface.\"For most research and enterprise applications, this clause functions as a light-touch attribution requirement while preserving the freedoms of standard MIT licensing. It makes K2 Thinking one of the most permissively licensed frontier-class models currently available.A New Benchmark LeaderKimi K2 Thinking is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model built around one trillion parameters, of which 32 billion activate per inference. It combines long-horizon reasoning with structured tool use, executing up to 200–300 sequential tool calls without human intervention.According to Moonshot’s published test results, K2 Thinking achieved:44.9 % on Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE), a state-of-the-art score;60.2 % on BrowseComp, an agentic web-search and reasoning test;71.3 % on SWE-Bench Verified and 83.1 % on LiveCodeBench v6, key coding evaluations;56.3 % on Seal-0, a benchmark for real-world information retrieval.Across these tasks, K2 Thinking consistently outperforms GPT-5’s corresponding scores and surpasses the previous open-weight leader MiniMax-M2—released just weeks earlier by Chinese rival MiniMax AI.Open Model Outperforms Proprietary SystemsGPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 Thinking remain the leading proprietary “thinking” models. Yet in the same benchmark suite, K2 Thinking’s agentic reasoning scores exceed both: for instance, on BrowseComp the open model’s 60.2 % decisively leads GPT-5’s 54.9 % and Claude 4.5’s 24.1 %.K2 Thinking also edges GPT-5 in GPQA Diamond (85.7 % vs 84.5 %) and matches it on mathematical reasoning tasks such as AIME 2025 and HMMT 2025. Only in certain heavy-mode configurations—where GPT-5 aggregates multiple trajectories—does the proprietary model regain parity.That Moonshot’s fully open-weight release can meet or exceed GPT-5’s scores marks a turning point. The gap between closed frontier systems and publicly available models has effectively collapsed for high-end reasoning and coding.Surpassing MiniMax-M2: The Previous Open-Source BenchmarkWhen VentureBeat profiled MiniMax-M2 just a week and a half ago, it was hailed as the “new king of open-source LLMs,” achieving top scores among open-weight systems:τ²-Bench 77.2BrowseComp 44.0FinSearchComp-global 65.5SWE-Bench Verified 69.4Those results placed MiniMax-M2 near GPT-5-level capability in agentic tool use. Yet Kimi K2 Thinking now eclipses them by wide margins.Its BrowseComp result of 60.2 % exceeds M2’s 44.0 %, and its SWE-Bench Verified 71.3 % edges out M2’s 69.4 %. Even on financial-reasoning tasks such as FinSearchComp-T3 (47.4 %), K2 Thinking performs comparably while maintaining superior general-purpose reasoning.Technically, both models adopt sparse Mixture-of-Experts architectures for compute efficiency, but Moonshot’s network activates more experts and deploys advanced quantization-aware training (INT4 QAT). This design doubles inference speed relative to standard precision without degrading accuracy—critical for long “thinking-token” sessions reaching 256 k context windows.Agentic Reasoning and Tool UseK2 Thinking’s defining capability lies in its explicit reasoning trace. The model outputs an auxiliary field, reasoning_content, revealing intermediate logic before each final response. This transparency preserves coherence across long multi-turn tasks and multi-step tool calls.A reference implementation published by Moonshot demonstrates how the model autonomously conducts a “daily news report” workflow: invoking date and web-search tools, analyzing retrieved content, and composing structured output—all while maintaining internal reasoning state.This end-to-end autonomy enables the model to plan, search, execute, and synthesize evidence across hundreds of steps, mirroring the emerging class of “agentic AI” systems that operate with minimal supervision.Efficiency and AccessDespite its trillion-parameter scale, K2 Thinking’s runtime cost remains modest. Moonshot lists usage at:$0.15 / 1 M tokens (cache hit)$0.60 / 1 M tokens (cache miss)$2.50 / 1 M tokens outputThese rates are competitive even against MiniMax-M2’s $0.30 input / $1.20 output pricing—and an order of magnitude below GPT-5 ($1.25 input / $10 output).Comparative Context: Open-Weight AccelerationThe rapid succession of M2 and K2 Thinking illustrates how quickly open-source research is catching frontier systems. MiniMax-M2 demonstrated that open models could approach GPT-5-class agentic capability at a fraction of the compute cost. Moonshot has now advanced that frontier further, pushing open weights beyond parity into outright leadership.Both models rely on sparse activation for efficiency, but K2 Thinking’s higher activation count (32 B vs 10 B active parameters) yields stronger reasoning fidelity across domains. Its test-time scaling—expanding “thinking tokens” and tool-calling turns—provides measurable performance gains without retraining, a feature not yet observed in MiniMax-M2.Technical OutlookMoonshot reports that K2 Thinking supports native INT4 inference and 256 k-token contexts with minimal performance degradation. Its architecture integrates quantization, parallel trajectory aggregation (“heavy mode”), and Mixture-of-Experts routing tuned for reasoning tasks.In practice, these optimizations allow K2 Thinking to sustain complex planning loops—code compile–test–fix, search–analyze–summarize—over hundreds of tool calls. This capability underpins its superior results on BrowseComp and SWE-Bench, where reasoning continuity is decisive.Enormous Implications for the AI EcosystemThe convergence of open and closed models at the high end signals a structural shift in the AI landscape. Enterprises that once relied exclusively on proprietary APIs can now deploy open alternatives matching GPT-5-level reasoning while retaining full control of weights, data, and compliance.Moonshot’s open publication strategy follows the precedent set by DeepSeek R1, Qwen3, GLM-4.6 and MiniMax-M2 but extends it to full agentic reasoning. For academic and enterprise developers, K2 Thinking provides both transparency and interoperability—the ability to inspect reasoning traces and fine-tune performance for domain-specific agents.The arrival of K2 Thinking signals that Moonshot — a young startup founded in 2023 with investment from some of China&#x27;s biggest apps and tech companies — is here to play in an intensifying competition, and comes amid growing scrutiny of the financial sustainability of AI’s largest players. Just a day ago, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar sparked controversy after suggesting at WSJ Tech Live event that the U.S. government might eventually need to provide a “backstop” for the company’s more than $1.4 trillion in compute and data-center commitments — a comment widely interpreted as a call for taxpayer-backed loan guarantees.Although Friar later clarified that OpenAI was not seeking direct federal support, the episode reignited debate about the scale and concentration of AI capital spending. With OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and Google all racing to secure long-term chip supply, critics warn of an unsustainable investment bubble and “AI arms race” driven more by strategic fear than commercial returns — one that could \"blow up\" and take down the entire global economy with it if there is hesitation or market uncertainty, as so many trades and valuations have now been made in anticipation of continued hefty AI investment and massive returns. Against that backdrop, Moonshot AI’s and MiniMax’s open-weight releases put more pressure on U.S. proprietary AI firms and their backers to justify the size of the investments and paths to profitability. If an enterprise customer can just as easily get comparable or better performance from a free, open source Chinese AI model than they do with paid, proprietary AI solutions like OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5, Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Sonnet 4.5, or Google&#x27;s Gemini 2.5 Pro — why would they continue paying to access the proprietary models? Already, Silicon Valley stalwarts like Airbnb have raised eyebrows for admitting to heavily using Chinese open source alternatives like Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen over OpenAI&#x27;s proprietary offerings. For investors and enterprises, these developments suggest that high-end AI capability is no longer synonymous with high-end capital expenditure. The most advanced reasoning systems may now come not from companies building gigascale data centers, but from research groups optimizing architectures and quantization for efficiency.In that sense, K2 Thinking’s benchmark dominance is not just a technical milestone—it’s a strategic one, arriving at a moment when the AI market’s biggest question has shifted from how powerful models can become to who can afford to sustain them.What It Means for Enterprises Going ForwardWithin weeks of MiniMax-M2’s ascent, Kimi K2 Thinking has overtaken it—along with GPT-5 and Claude 4.5—across nearly every reasoning and agentic benchmark. The model demonstrates that open-weight systems can now meet or surpass proprietary frontier models in both capability and efficiency.For the AI research community, K2 Thinking represents more than another open model: it is evidence that the frontier has become collaborative. The best-performing reasoning model available today is not a closed commercial product but an open-source system accessible to anyone.",

This transparency preserves coherence across long multi-turn tasks and multi-step tool calls.A reference implementation published by Moonshot demonstrates how the model autonomously conducts a “daily news report” workflow: invoking date and web-search tools, analyzing retrieved content, and composing structured output—all while maintaining internal reasoning state.This end-to-end autonomy enables the model to plan, search, execute, and synthesize evidence across hundreds of steps, mirroring the emerging class of “agentic AI” systems that operate with minimal supervision.Efficiency and AccessDespite its trillion-parameter scale, K2 Thinking’s runtime cost remains modest. Moonshot lists usage at:$0.15 / 1 M tokens (cache hit)$0.60 / 1 M tokens (cache miss)$2.50 / 1 M tokens outputThese rates are competitive even against MiniMax-M2’s $0.30 input / $1.20 output pricing—and an order of magnitude below GPT-5 ($1.25 input / $10 output).Comparative Context: Open-Weight AccelerationThe rapid succession of M2 and K2 Thinking illustrates how quickly open-source research is catching frontier systems. MiniMax-M2 demonstrated that open models could approach GPT-5-class agentic capability at a fraction of the compute cost. Moonshot has now advanced that frontier further, pushing open weights beyond parity into outright leadership.Both models rely on sparse activation for efficiency, but K2 Thinking’s higher activation count (32 B vs 10 B active parameters) yields stronger reasoning fidelity across domains. Its test-time scaling—expanding “thinking tokens” and tool-calling turns—provides measurable performance gains without retraining, a feature not yet observed in MiniMax-M2.Technical OutlookMoonshot reports that K2 Thinking supports native INT4 inference and 256 k-token contexts with minimal performance degradation. Its architecture integrates quantization, parallel trajectory aggregation (“heavy mode”), and Mixture-of-Experts routing tuned for reasoning tasks.In practice, these optimizations allow K2 Thinking to sustain complex planning loops—code compile–test–fix, search–analyze–summarize—over hundreds of tool calls. This capability underpins its superior results on BrowseComp and SWE-Bench, where reasoning continuity is decisive.Enormous Implications for the AI EcosystemThe convergence of open and closed models at the high end signals a structural shift in the AI landscape. Enterprises that once relied exclusively on proprietary APIs can now deploy open alternatives matching GPT-5-level reasoning while retaining full control of weights, data, and compliance.Moonshot’s open publication strategy follows the precedent set by DeepSeek R1, Qwen3, GLM-4.6 and MiniMax-M2 but extends it to full agentic reasoning. For academic and enterprise developers, K2 Thinking provides both transparency and interoperability—the ability to inspect reasoning traces and fine-tune performance for domain-specific agents.The arrival of K2 Thinking signals that Moonshot — a young startup founded in 2023 with investment from some of China&#x27;s biggest apps and tech companies — is here to play in an intensifying competition, and comes amid growing scrutiny of the financial sustainability of AI’s largest players. Just a day ago, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar sparked controversy after suggesting at WSJ Tech Live event that the U.S. government might eventually need to provide a “backstop” for the company’s more than $1.4 trillion in compute and data-center commitments — a comment widely interpreted as a call for taxpayer-backed loan guarantees.Although Friar later clarified that OpenAI was not seeking direct federal support, the episode reignited debate about the scale and concentration of AI capital spending. With OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, and Google all racing to secure long-term chip supply, critics warn of an unsustainable investment bubble and “AI arms race” driven more by strategic fear than commercial returns — one that could \"blow up\" and take down the entire global economy with it if there is hesitation or market uncertainty, as so many trades and valuations have now been made in anticipation of continued hefty AI investment and massive returns. Against that backdrop, Moonshot AI’s and MiniMax’s open-weight releases put more pressure on U.S. proprietary AI firms and their backers to justify the size of the investments and paths to profitability. If an enterprise customer can just as easily get comparable or better performance from a free, open source Chinese AI model than they do with paid, proprietary AI solutions like OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5, Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Sonnet 4.5, or Google&#x27;s Gemini 2.5 Pro — why would they continue paying to access the proprietary models? Already, Silicon Valley stalwarts like Airbnb have raised eyebrows for admitting to heavily using Chinese open source alternatives like Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen over OpenAI&#x27;s proprietary offerings. For investors and enterprises, these developments suggest that high-end AI capability is no longer synonymous with high-end capital expenditure. The most advanced reasoning systems may now come not from companies building gigascale data centers, but from research groups optimizing architectures and quantization for efficiency.In that sense, K2 Thinking’s benchmark dominance is not just a technical milestone—it’s a strategic one, arriving at a moment when the AI market’s biggest question has shifted from how powerful models can become to who can afford to sustain them.What It Means for Enterprises Going ForwardWithin weeks of MiniMax-M2’s ascent, Kimi K2 Thinking has overtaken it—along with GPT-5 and Claude 4.5—across nearly every reasoning and agentic benchmark. The model demonstrates that open-weight systems can now meet or surpass proprietary frontier models in both capability and efficiency.For the AI research community, K2 Thinking represents more than another open model: it is evidence that the frontier has become collaborative. The best-performing reasoning model available today is not a closed commercial product but an open-source system accessible to anyone.",

We’re tracking all of the best Black Friday deals you can get right now so you don’t have to go searching for them.Engadget can help if you have tech on your shopping list this year. Here, we’ve curated the best Black Friday tech deals you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals to shop now Apple iPad mini for $399 ($100 off): Apple's smallest tablet, the iPad mini is the best option for those who prefer their tablet be roughly the size of a paperback book. The latest model runs on the A17 Pro chipset and has an upgraded 128GB of storage in the base configuration. It also supports the Apple Pencil Pro. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Google Pixel 9a for $499 (38 percent off): It doesn't get much better than the Pixel 9a if you're looking for a smartphone well under $1,000. It's our top pick for the best midrange smartphone on the market right now thanks to its simple yet excellent design, AMOLED display, strong battery life and solid camera array. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $199 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. Also available at Best Buy. Lego Disney advent calendar 2025 43253 for $40 (11 percent off): I probably don't need to tell you 'tis the season for advent calendars. Lego has a bunch, and this one in particular is on a good deal right now. Like most Lego advent calendars, this one includes a number of bricks and minifigs that, when put together, make a coherent, themed scene. EcoFlow Black Friday deals — get up to 80 percent off: Portable power stations are an investment, but they can be crucial pieces of tech during emergencies. The top pick from our friends at Yahoo Tech has been heavily discounted in this early Black Friday sale. You can pick up the EcoFlow Delta Pro 3 for $1,400 off, down to $2,299, or the power station with an extra battery bundled in for $2,699 off, down to $3,599. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Google TV Streamer 4K for $75 ($25 off): Our top pick for the best streaming device right now, the latest version of Google's streamer supports 4K video and an excellent, easy-to-use interface that will feel familiar to anyone who's seen a set with the Google TV technology built in.

Also available at Walmart. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Shark AI Ultra robot vacuum with 60-day self-emptying base for $300 (50 percent off): This is a version of one of our top picks for the best robot vacuums. We generally like Shark machines because they do a good job cleaning all types of flooring, produce accurate home maps and the companion app is pretty easy to use. This one in particularly comes with a self-emptying base that can hold up to 60 days worth of debris. Black Friday FAQs When is Black Friday 2025? Black Friday 2025 lands on November 28.

Amazon has the M4-powered, 13-inch MacBook Air for a record-low price of $749 right now. The 25 percent discount applies to multiple colors, too. We ranked this as our favorite Apple laptop in our list of the best MacBook computers. Heck, it's even our very favorite laptop. Full stop. The performance is exceptionally snappy, thanks to the M4 chip. We appreciated the upgraded battery life, which now lasts for around 18 hours per charge. That's well beyond a full day of work. The design is lightweight, but sturdy. This has become a hallmark for modern MacBook Air computers. The screen is both gorgeous and roomy, even though it's technically just a 13-inch panel. There's support for the P3 wide color gamut and it can reach up to 500 nits of brightness. This is a near-perfect laptop, but there are a couple of nitpicks. There's no USB-C port on the right side, limiting how users can arrange accessories on a desk. Also, the screen is capped with a 60Hz refresh rate. Another potential complication is the looming specter of the M5 chip. The company has already released the MacBook Pro M5, so a new MacBook Air is likely coming in the nearish future.

          "standfirst": "Two former Meta employees are launching a new AI-powered smart ring. Stream Ring is the debut product from Sandbar, and it’s available to pre-order right now. Sandbar describes Stream as \"your extended self,\" which is to say that it’s a deliberately minimalist smart ring that you can use to take voice notes and interact with a chatbot directly using the built-in touch-activated microphone. When you create a voice note, the Stream Ring uses haptic feedback to confirm that it’s been recorded. You hold the sensor to speak and tap it if you want to interrupt and start over. It can automatically transcribe your voice interactions, whether you’re simply compiling a grocery list on the go, asking it to fetch some information from the web, or having a more back-and-forth conversation with the device. These notes will appear in the Stream app via Bluetooth, which will be iOS-only at launch. Sandbar thinks a ring is the best form for its wearable to take as it’s always available and accessible, whatever you’re doing, so you easily can log a thought as soon as it pops into your head. It wants people to think of the Stream Ring as a \"mouse for voice,\" and says the mic will always be able to pick up your voice clearly in a noisy room. Crucially, it isn’t always listening either, only activating when you hold the touchpad. As for the chatbot, it’s designed by default to somewhat mimic your own voice using AI, a feature Sandbar calls Inner Voice. You can update it if you think it sounds off, or if the whole concept creeps you out you can also switch to a non-personalized voice. Away from the core voice note functionality, the Stream Ring can also be used to control media playback using gestures, and Sandbar says it’s compatible with any headphones. Sandbar will offer a free plan that includes unlimited notes but limits AI interactions. For $10 per month you can upgrade to a Stream Pro subscription (you get three months for free with a new purchase), which enables unlimited chats and immediate access to any new features. Sandbar says your data is encrypted at rest and in transit and it will not sell your information to other companies. You can also delete data stored in the app at any time. Other smart rings have promised a seamless interactive experience built around AI, and the Stream Ring isn’t going down the health tracking route that many other products in this increasingly crowded space market themselves on. But if the transcription feature works as reliably as advertised and Sandbar’s AI proves to be a genuinely useful assistant, the Stream Ring could be a useful accessory that doesn’t get in the way when it isn’t needed. The Stream Ring is available in sizes 5-13 and is designed to be worn on your index finger. Sandbar promises \"all-day battery life\" but doesn’t go into specifics. It’s expected to start shipping next summer in the US and costs $249.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/the-ai-powered-stream-ring-is-designed-for-on-the-fly-voice-notes-143530840.html?src=rss",

One of the best discounts at the moment is on the Delta Pro 3, which is 37 percent off and down to $2,299. That's the lowest we've seen it and, considering it typically costs $3,699, it's a great deal. Amazon's matching the sale price as well. The Delta Pro 3 topped Yahoo's list of the best portable power stations, and for very good reason. This thing is a beast. It boasts a 4,096Wh capacity, so it can power an average 500-watt refrigerator for over 24 hours. That's with continuous use. It can be stretched out to two or three days by only running the appliance during daylight hours. There's even a discounted bundle that includes an extra battery for $3,599. It includes four standard 120V AC outlets and a single 240V outlet. It could potentially be a temporary hub of a whole-home battery backup. There are numerous charging options here, including a standard AC outlet, solar panels and, interestingly, a cigarette lighter. The only potential downside here is the Delta Pro 3 really pushes the boundaries of what can be considered portable. It weighs 113 pounds, though it does have wheels and a telescoping handle. The Delta Pro 3 is just one of the products on sale right now. The Delta Pro Ultra, which is intended as a whole-home backup, is down to $3,999. This represents a savings of more than $2,000.

One of the best discounts we're tracking at the moment is on the M4-powered Mac Mini desktop — it's $100 off right now, down from $599 to $499. That applies to the 16GB of RAM/256GB SSD model, and it's pretty close to its all-time-low price. We gave the Mac mini M4 a 90 in our review, in part, because it packs an incredible amount of power into such a small design. It also has front facing USB-C and headphone ports, a first for the Mac mini lineup. Plus, it starts with 16GB of RAM, an upgrade from its predecessors. However, if you want more memory or storage, the other Mac Mini M4 models are also on sale. You can get 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD for $690, down from $799. Then there's the option for 24GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD at $890, down from $999. Plus, if you want to bundle in three years of AppleCare+, each model ends up being about $100 cheaper than normal. If you're looking to build a desktop setup from scratch, there's a small but notable discount on Apple's Magic Trackpad as well. It's down to $120, which is only seven percent off its usual price but it's the cheapest we've seen it.

If you use the code MONARCHVIP at checkout, you can get an annual plan for 50 percent off. It typically costs $100, but you can get 12 months of access for $50 with this code. There are some key caveats here. The discount is only for new users, and it can't be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web. You can't redeem it through the Monarch mobile app. We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it offers a great deal of customization and granularity, which outweighs our misgivings. On the main dashboard, you'll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you've set. There's also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what's been happening with your money that month. You'll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time. Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date. While it might take a little work to set up Monarch (and you might have to tweak things here and there), it's a detailed budgeting app that can help you keep better track of your income, expenditure and net worth. If you're a former Mint user (RIP), Monarch Money is a great alternative if you haven't yet found a Mint replacement. But it's worth mentioning that our favorite Mint replacement service, Quicken Simplifi, also has a sale going on right now.

          "title": "The gear I used to photograph Paul McCartney",
          "standfirst": "This story about Paul McCartney begins with one of his old bandmates. \"I'm not really Beatle George,\" the ever-philosophical George Harrison once said. \"For me, Beatle George was a suit or a shirt that I once wore. And the only problem is, for the rest of my life, people are going to look at that shirt and mistake it for me.\" On one hand, that’s, well, George being George. But his quote does speak to our need to mythologize the Beatles. It’s hard not to! The music is so exquisite, influential and timeless that we look for grand stories to tell about it. We want a stronger connection to it, so we pore over biographies, interviews and documentaries. We seek meaning and purpose in their story. Still, it must be surreal to be one of the four protagonists of that story. At some point, the narrative takes on a life of its own that may not reflect your experience. McCartney alluded to that in the 2013 song \"Early Days.\" \"Now everybody seems to have their own opinion on who did this and who did that,\" he sang. \"But as for me, I don't see how they can remember when they weren't where it was at.\" So, I’ll try not to mythologize the Beatles too much as I describe my experience photographing Sir Paul McCartney last month. I will, of course, fail spectacularly at that mission. The crowd ranged from seniors to teens in Sgt. Pepper costumes. Will Shanklin for Engadget Months before I watched him play for nearly three hours in front of 15,000 fans (at age 83!) at Albuquerque’s Isleta Amphitheater, I sent a press request to his team. A few days before the concert, I learned that my photography pass had been approved. Once it sank in, I screamed and giggled, not unlike the teenagers in Ed Sullivan's audience. (Don't judge those gals until you've been near a Beatle!) But there wasn’t much time to soak up the excitement. Without any real cameras on hand — my iPhone 17 Pro certainly wasn’t going to cut it — and only a few days to prepare, some quick decisions were in order. After enough internal debate to make my head spin off its axis, I settled on an oddball combination. For the body, I went with the Canon EOS R50, an ultra-compact mirrorless with a 24-megapixel APS-C sensor. Was it the best one available? Not at all. But instead of renting a $3,000 camera, I decided to buy something in my budget that I'll enjoy using for years. I'd already eyed it after handling a display model and reading Steve Dent's review. Plus, it created a fun challenge: How can a sub-$800 consumer-facing camera stand up to the unique demands of concert photography? The lens, on the other hand, is no place to mess around. So I rented the Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8 L IS USM, a gargantuan, professional-grade telephoto one. (It's the precursor to this $2,399 one.) This choice was simple: It was by far the most concert-appropriate lens available to rent. It maintains sharpness and contrast across its long zoom range, its autofocus is fast and its f/2.8 aperture is crucial for the unique demands of stage lighting. Put the tiny camera and ginormous lens together (with this $38 adapter), and you get the odd couple you see below. To say this sucker was front-weighted would be an understatement. \"She's so heavy...\" Will Shanklin for Engadget Camera in hand (and Beatles hoodie equipped), I took my position in the tight press pen. The photography area was about 150 yards from the stage and didn’t allow for lateral movement, so ideas for creative compositions were set aside. My only option was to push that glass out to 200mm (or close to it) and fire away. Save those composition ideas for when it's time to crop. When photographing someone like Sir Paul, you ideally want an image that captures not only the man and the musician, but also that larger-than-life myth. It should be something grand that you’d want to hang on your wall. No pressure! Sir Paul's first number was the John Lennon-penned classic \"Help!\" Until this year's leg of the Got Back tour, McCartney hadn't played the song in full since 1990. We can only speculate about his reasons for pulling it out of his bag now. But I feel like the song's desperate pleas gain new poignancy in 2025. I can't count the times I've wanted to cry out to someone — anyone! — to \"Please, please help me\" after reading the news. We were huddled close enough together that I was glad I wore these $16 kneepads under my jeans. When the crowd in front of us settled down a bit, I kneeled to give my photographer cohorts more elbow room. My right knee bounced pleasantly onto the cozy leg pillow. Will Shanklin for Engadget With one song already down, the R50's burst mode was getting a workout. The stock Canon battery was still going strong, but I had these two third-party spares stashed in this camera bag to swap out if necessary. (I didn't end up needing them, despite snapping over 600 photos.) McCartney transitioned into his second number, \"Coming Up,\" the first track from 1980's McCartney II. That LP was ahead of its time, embracing synths, drum machines and other studio tricks before they became commonplace. Contemporary critics didn’t care much for it, but it later became a cult classic. That combination illustrates something about his solo career: always experimenting, sometimes misunderstood, but ultimately vindicated. Two songs were over in a flash. Macca addressed the crowd, and picture time was over. Off to leave my camera with security, and claim the faraway lawn seat I bought long before I knew I'd have press access. The rest of McCartney's set included a perfect balance of Beatles, Wings and solo numbers. (There was even an old Quarrymen song, \"In Spite of All the Danger.\") As you can see in the photos, he started on his trademark Höfner bass. But he moved on to piano, acoustic and electric guitars and ukulele. The latter was for his beautiful rendition of Harrison's \"Something.\" That number wasn’t the only point that moved me. The most notable was where he teamed with Lennon on \"I've Got a Feeling.\" Present-day McCartney singing with 1969 Lennon, who appeared on the giant screen above (via the restored rooftop concert footage in Get Back), was profound. \"I love that one because I get to sing with John again,\" he said. Will Shanklin for Engadget Sir Paul strikes me as someone who’s always looking forward. But the Got Back tour is a chance to look back. It lets us, the romanticizing fans, join him on the long and winding road from the Quarrymen to today. The entire production made me feel like a passenger on his journey. I could go on. But you don't need me to elevate Paul McCartney's musical legacy any more than you need me to explain Michael Jordan's basketball skills or Meryl Streep's acting chops. Listen to the music — and catch his tour if you can — and you'll feel it. As for the photos, my favorite is the one at the top of this article. (I also included a color version in the gallery below.) It’s the only one that (to me) captures the man, musician and myth as he plays his Höfner bass. Out of more than 600 rapidly-fired photos, one that feels just right is good enough for me. But even if they all sucked, who cares! Decades from now, I'll tell everyone at the old folks' home that, when I was young (and my heart was an open book), I snapped some pictures of Sir Paul McCartney. The story may grow more inflated by then, and maybe I’ll invent new details. But perhaps I can be forgiven for a bit of mythologizing.

Plus, it created a fun challenge: How can a sub-$800 consumer-facing camera stand up to the unique demands of concert photography? The lens, on the other hand, is no place to mess around. So I rented the Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8 L IS USM, a gargantuan, professional-grade telephoto one. (It's the precursor to this $2,399 one.) This choice was simple: It was by far the most concert-appropriate lens available to rent. It maintains sharpness and contrast across its long zoom range, its autofocus is fast and its f/2.8 aperture is crucial for the unique demands of stage lighting. Put the tiny camera and ginormous lens together (with this $38 adapter), and you get the odd couple you see below. To say this sucker was front-weighted would be an understatement. \"She's so heavy...\" Will Shanklin for Engadget Camera in hand (and Beatles hoodie equipped), I took my position in the tight press pen. The photography area was about 150 yards from the stage and didn’t allow for lateral movement, so ideas for creative compositions were set aside. My only option was to push that glass out to 200mm (or close to it) and fire away. Save those composition ideas for when it's time to crop. When photographing someone like Sir Paul, you ideally want an image that captures not only the man and the musician, but also that larger-than-life myth. It should be something grand that you’d want to hang on your wall. No pressure! Sir Paul's first number was the John Lennon-penned classic \"Help!\" Until this year's leg of the Got Back tour, McCartney hadn't played the song in full since 1990. We can only speculate about his reasons for pulling it out of his bag now. But I feel like the song's desperate pleas gain new poignancy in 2025. I can't count the times I've wanted to cry out to someone — anyone! — to \"Please, please help me\" after reading the news. We were huddled close enough together that I was glad I wore these $16 kneepads under my jeans. When the crowd in front of us settled down a bit, I kneeled to give my photographer cohorts more elbow room. My right knee bounced pleasantly onto the cozy leg pillow. Will Shanklin for Engadget With one song already down, the R50's burst mode was getting a workout. The stock Canon battery was still going strong, but I had these two third-party spares stashed in this camera bag to swap out if necessary. (I didn't end up needing them, despite snapping over 600 photos.) McCartney transitioned into his second number, \"Coming Up,\" the first track from 1980's McCartney II. That LP was ahead of its time, embracing synths, drum machines and other studio tricks before they became commonplace. Contemporary critics didn’t care much for it, but it later became a cult classic. That combination illustrates something about his solo career: always experimenting, sometimes misunderstood, but ultimately vindicated. Two songs were over in a flash. Macca addressed the crowd, and picture time was over. Off to leave my camera with security, and claim the faraway lawn seat I bought long before I knew I'd have press access. The rest of McCartney's set included a perfect balance of Beatles, Wings and solo numbers. (There was even an old Quarrymen song, \"In Spite of All the Danger.\") As you can see in the photos, he started on his trademark Höfner bass. But he moved on to piano, acoustic and electric guitars and ukulele. The latter was for his beautiful rendition of Harrison's \"Something.\" That number wasn’t the only point that moved me. The most notable was where he teamed with Lennon on \"I've Got a Feeling.\" Present-day McCartney singing with 1969 Lennon, who appeared on the giant screen above (via the restored rooftop concert footage in Get Back), was profound. \"I love that one because I get to sing with John again,\" he said. Will Shanklin for Engadget Sir Paul strikes me as someone who’s always looking forward. But the Got Back tour is a chance to look back. It lets us, the romanticizing fans, join him on the long and winding road from the Quarrymen to today. The entire production made me feel like a passenger on his journey. I could go on. But you don't need me to elevate Paul McCartney's musical legacy any more than you need me to explain Michael Jordan's basketball skills or Meryl Streep's acting chops. Listen to the music — and catch his tour if you can — and you'll feel it. As for the photos, my favorite is the one at the top of this article. (I also included a color version in the gallery below.) It’s the only one that (to me) captures the man, musician and myth as he plays his Höfner bass. Out of more than 600 rapidly-fired photos, one that feels just right is good enough for me. But even if they all sucked, who cares! Decades from now, I'll tell everyone at the old folks' home that, when I was young (and my heart was an open book), I snapped some pictures of Sir Paul McCartney. The story may grow more inflated by then, and maybe I’ll invent new details. But perhaps I can be forgiven for a bit of mythologizing.

          "standfirst": "One of the best streaming devices you can get today is deeply discounted on Amazon ahead of Black Friday. The Google TV Streamer is going for just $75 right now — the lowest price we've seen it hit yet. The device normally costs $100. The Amazon deal applies to both color options, White and the soft gray Haze. The Google TV Streamer is our top pick for an all-in-one streaming device. It has a faster processor than Google's previous streaming devices (22 percent faster, according to the company), so you can switch between apps and different media without lagging. It also has more storage and memory, at 32GB and 4GB, respectively. Google TV streamer has an intuitive interface and keeps all of your favorite content from different streaming apps organized in one menu. It also seamlessly integrates Google Home, allowing you to control your smart home devices from a slideout panel on the TV. The 4K streamer comes in a set-top wedge design, rather than the dongle of Chromecasts past, but you'll have to pick up an HDMI cable separately if you don't already have one you can use. It comes with a small remote that you can ping by pressing a button on the streamer for when you inevitably misplace it. In her review of the device, Engadget's Amy Skorheim called the Google TV streamer \"a full-featured, competent device with an interface that’s better than most at pulling together all the disparate threads of a streaming experience.\" One of its only downsides is the relatively high cost at $100, so don't let this deal go to waste. In addition to the streaming device, Google has a bunch of other tech on sale for Black Friday. The entry-level Nest thermostat is on sale for $90 right now, and the Nest Wi-Fi Pro 6E router has dropped to $120 for a single-pack; that's 40 percent off.

          "title": "Google debuts AI chips with 4X performance boost, secures Anthropic megadeal worth billions",
          "standfirst": "Google Cloud is introducing what it calls its most powerful artificial intelligence infrastructure to date, unveiling a seventh-generation Tensor Processing Unit and expanded Arm-based computing options designed to meet surging demand for AI model deployment — what the company characterizes as a fundamental industry shift from training models to serving them to billions of users.The announcement, made Thursday, centers on Ironwood, Google&#x27;s latest custom AI accelerator chip, which will become generally available in the coming weeks. In a striking validation of the technology, Anthropic, the AI safety company behind the Claude family of models, disclosed plans to access up to one million of these TPU chips — a commitment worth tens of billions of dollars and among the largest known AI infrastructure deals to date.The move underscores an intensifying competition among cloud providers to control the infrastructure layer powering artificial intelligence, even as questions mount about whether the industry can sustain its current pace of capital expenditure. Google&#x27;s approach — building custom silicon rather than relying solely on Nvidia&#x27;s dominant GPU chips — amounts to a long-term bet that vertical integration from chip design through software will deliver superior economics and performance.Why companies are racing to serve AI models, not just train themGoogle executives framed the announcements around what they call \"the age of inference\" — a transition point where companies shift resources from training frontier AI models to deploying them in production applications serving millions or billions of requests daily.\"Today&#x27;s frontier models, including Google&#x27;s Gemini, Veo, and Imagen and Anthropic&#x27;s Claude train and serve on Tensor Processing Units,\" said Amin Vahdat, vice president and general manager of AI and Infrastructure at Google Cloud. \"For many organizations, the focus is shifting from training these models to powering useful, responsive interactions with them.\"This transition has profound implications for infrastructure requirements. Where training workloads can often tolerate batch processing and longer completion times, inference — the process of actually running a trained model to generate responses — demands consistently low latency, high throughput, and unwavering reliability. A chatbot that takes 30 seconds to respond, or a coding assistant that frequently times out, becomes unusable regardless of the underlying model&#x27;s capabilities.Agentic workflows — where AI systems take autonomous actions rather than simply responding to prompts — create particularly complex infrastructure challenges, requiring tight coordination between specialized AI accelerators and general-purpose computing.Inside Ironwood&#x27;s architecture: 9,216 chips working as one supercomputerIronwood is more than incremental improvement over Google&#x27;s sixth-generation TPUs. According to technical specifications shared by the company, it delivers more than four times better performance for both training and inference workloads compared to its predecessor — gains that Google attributes to a system-level co-design approach rather than simply increasing transistor counts.The architecture&#x27;s most striking feature is its scale. A single Ironwood \"pod\" — a tightly integrated unit of TPU chips functioning as one supercomputer — can connect up to 9,216 individual chips through Google&#x27;s proprietary Inter-Chip Interconnect network operating at 9.6 terabits per second. To put that bandwidth in perspective, it&#x27;s roughly equivalent to downloading the entire Library of Congress in under two seconds.This massive interconnect fabric allows the 9,216 chips to share access to 1.77 petabytes of High Bandwidth Memory — memory fast enough to keep pace with the chips&#x27; processing speeds. That&#x27;s approximately 40,000 high-definition Blu-ray movies&#x27; worth of working memory, instantly accessible by thousands of processors simultaneously. \"For context, that means Ironwood Pods can deliver 118x more FP8 ExaFLOPS versus the next closest competitor,\" Google stated in technical documentation.The system employs Optical Circuit Switching technology that acts as a \"dynamic, reconfigurable fabric.\" When individual components fail or require maintenance — inevitable at this scale — the OCS technology automatically reroutes data traffic around the interruption within milliseconds, allowing workloads to continue running without user-visible disruption.This reliability focus reflects lessons learned from deploying five previous TPU generations. Google reported that its fleet-wide uptime for liquid-cooled systems has maintained approximately 99.999% availability since 2020 — equivalent to less than six minutes of downtime per year.Anthropic&#x27;s billion-dollar bet validates Google&#x27;s custom silicon strategyPerhaps the most significant external validation of Ironwood&#x27;s capabilities comes from Anthropic&#x27;s commitment to access up to one million TPU chips — a staggering figure in an industry where even clusters of 10,000 to 50,000 accelerators are considered massive.\"Anthropic and Google have a longstanding partnership and this latest expansion will help us continue to grow the compute we need to define the frontier of AI,\" said Krishna Rao, Anthropic&#x27;s chief financial officer, in the official partnership agreement. \"Our customers — from Fortune 500 companies to AI-native startups — depend on Claude for their most important work, and this expanded capacity ensures we can meet our exponentially growing demand.\"According to a separate statement, Anthropic will have access to \"well over a gigawatt of capacity coming online in 2026\" — enough electricity to power a small city. The company specifically cited TPUs&#x27; \"price-performance and efficiency\" as key factors in the decision, along with \"existing experience in training and serving its models with TPUs.\"Industry analysts estimate that a commitment to access one million TPU chips, with associated infrastructure, networking, power, and cooling, likely represents a multi-year contract worth tens of billions of dollars — among the largest known cloud infrastructure commitments in history.James Bradbury, Anthropic&#x27;s head of compute, elaborated on the inference focus: \"Ironwood&#x27;s improvements in both inference performance and training scalability will help us scale efficiently while maintaining the speed and reliability our customers expect.\"Google&#x27;s Axion processors target the computing workloads that make AI possibleAlongside Ironwood, Google introduced expanded options for its Axion processor family — custom Arm-based CPUs designed for general-purpose workloads that support AI applications but don&#x27;t require specialized accelerators.The N4A instance type, now entering preview, targets what Google describes as \"microservices, containerized applications, open-source databases, batch, data analytics, development environments, experimentation, data preparation and web serving jobs that make AI applications possible.\" The company claims N4A delivers up to 2X better price-performance than comparable current-generation x86-based virtual machines.Google is also previewing C4A metal, its first bare-metal Arm instance, which provides dedicated physical servers for specialized workloads such as Android development, automotive systems, and software with strict licensing requirements.The Axion strategy reflects a growing conviction that the future of computing infrastructure requires both specialized AI accelerators and highly efficient general-purpose processors. While a TPU handles the computationally intensive task of running an AI model, Axion-class processors manage data ingestion, preprocessing, application logic, API serving, and countless other tasks in a modern AI application stack.Early customer results suggest the approach delivers measurable economic benefits. Vimeo reported observing \"a 30% improvement in performance for our core transcoding workload compared to comparable x86 VMs\" in initial N4A tests. ZoomInfo measured \"a 60% improvement in price-performance\" for data processing pipelines running on Java services, according to Sergei Koren, the company&#x27;s chief infrastructure architect.Software tools turn raw silicon performance into developer productivityHardware performance means little if developers cannot easily harness it. Google emphasized that Ironwood and Axion are integrated into what it calls AI Hypercomputer — \"an integrated supercomputing system that brings together compute, networking, storage, and software to improve system-level performance and efficiency.\"According to an October 2025 IDC Business Value Snapshot study, AI Hypercomputer customers achieved on average 353% three-year return on investment, 28% lower IT costs, and 55% more efficient IT teams.Google disclosed several software enhancements designed to maximize Ironwood utilization. Google Kubernetes Engine now offers advanced maintenance and topology awareness for TPU clusters, enabling intelligent scheduling and highly resilient deployments. The company&#x27;s open-source MaxText framework now supports advanced training techniques including Supervised Fine-Tuning and Generative Reinforcement Policy Optimization.Perhaps most significant for production deployments, Google&#x27;s Inference Gateway intelligently load-balances requests across model servers to optimize critical metrics. According to Google, it can reduce time-to-first-token latency by 96% and serving costs by up to 30% through techniques like prefix-cache-aware routing.The Inference Gateway monitors key metrics including KV cache hits, GPU or TPU utilization, and request queue length, then routes incoming requests to the optimal replica. For conversational AI applications where multiple requests might share context, routing requests with shared prefixes to the same server instance can dramatically reduce redundant computation.The hidden challenge: powering and cooling one-megawatt server racksBehind these announcements lies a massive physical infrastructure challenge that Google addressed at the recent Open Compute Project EMEA Summit. The company disclosed that it&#x27;s implementing +/-400 volt direct current power delivery capable of supporting up to one megawatt per rack — a tenfold increase from typical deployments.\"The AI era requires even greater power delivery capabilities,\" explained Madhusudan Iyengar and Amber Huffman, Google principal engineers, in an April 2025 blog post. \"ML will require more than 500 kW per IT rack before 2030.\"Google is collaborating with Meta and Microsoft to standardize electrical and mechanical interfaces for high-voltage DC distribution. The company selected 400 VDC specifically to leverage the supply chain established by electric vehicles, \"for greater economies of scale, more efficient manufacturing, and improved quality and scale.\"On cooling, Google revealed it will contribute its fifth-generation cooling distribution unit design to the Open Compute Project. The company has deployed liquid cooling \"at GigaWatt scale across more than 2,000 TPU Pods in the past seven years\" with fleet-wide availability of approximately 99.999%.Water can transport approximately 4,000 times more heat per unit volume than air for a given temperature change — critical as individual AI accelerator chips increasingly dissipate 1,000 watts or more.Custom silicon gambit challenges Nvidia&#x27;s AI accelerator dominanceGoogle&#x27;s announcements come as the AI infrastructure market reaches an inflection point. While Nvidia maintains overwhelming dominance in AI accelerators — holding an estimated 80-95% market share — cloud providers are increasingly investing in custom silicon to differentiate their offerings and improve unit economics.Amazon Web Services pioneered this approach with Graviton Arm-based CPUs and Inferentia / Trainium AI chips. Microsoft has developed Cobalt processors and is reportedly working on AI accelerators. Google now offers the most comprehensive custom silicon portfolio among major cloud providers.The strategy faces inherent challenges. Custom chip development requires enormous upfront investment — often billions of dollars. The software ecosystem for specialized accelerators lags behind Nvidia&#x27;s CUDA platform, which benefits from 15+ years of developer tools. And rapid AI model architecture evolution creates risk that custom silicon optimized for today&#x27;s models becomes less relevant as new techniques emerge.Yet Google argues its approach delivers unique advantages. \"This is how we built the first TPU ten years ago, which in turn unlocked the invention of the Transformer eight years ago — the very architecture that powers most of modern AI,\" the company noted, referring to the seminal \"Attention Is All You Need\" paper from Google researchers in 2017.The argument is that tight integration — \"model research, software, and hardware development under one roof\" — enables optimizations impossible with off-the-shelf components.Beyond Anthropic, several other customers provided early feedback. Lightricks, which develops creative AI tools, reported that early Ironwood testing \"makes us highly enthusiastic\" about creating \"more nuanced, precise, and higher-fidelity image and video generation for our millions of global customers,\" said Yoav HaCohen, the company&#x27;s research director.Google&#x27;s announcements raise questions that will play out over coming quarters. Can the industry sustain current infrastructure spending, with major AI companies collectively committing hundreds of billions of dollars? Will custom silicon prove economically superior to Nvidia GPUs? How will model architectures evolve?For now, Google appears committed to a strategy that has defined the company for decades: building custom infrastructure to enable applications impossible on commodity hardware, then making that infrastructure available to customers who want similar capabilities without the capital investment.As the AI industry transitions from research labs to production deployments serving billions of users, that infrastructure layer — the silicon, software, networking, power, and cooling that make it all run — may prove as important as the models themselves.And if Anthropic&#x27;s willingness to commit to accessing up to one million chips is any indication, Google&#x27;s bet on custom silicon designed specifically for the age of inference may be paying off just as demand reaches its inflection point.",

The software ecosystem for specialized accelerators lags behind Nvidia&#x27;s CUDA platform, which benefits from 15+ years of developer tools. And rapid AI model architecture evolution creates risk that custom silicon optimized for today&#x27;s models becomes less relevant as new techniques emerge.Yet Google argues its approach delivers unique advantages. \"This is how we built the first TPU ten years ago, which in turn unlocked the invention of the Transformer eight years ago — the very architecture that powers most of modern AI,\" the company noted, referring to the seminal \"Attention Is All You Need\" paper from Google researchers in 2017.The argument is that tight integration — \"model research, software, and hardware development under one roof\" — enables optimizations impossible with off-the-shelf components.Beyond Anthropic, several other customers provided early feedback. Lightricks, which develops creative AI tools, reported that early Ironwood testing \"makes us highly enthusiastic\" about creating \"more nuanced, precise, and higher-fidelity image and video generation for our millions of global customers,\" said Yoav HaCohen, the company&#x27;s research director.Google&#x27;s announcements raise questions that will play out over coming quarters. Can the industry sustain current infrastructure spending, with major AI companies collectively committing hundreds of billions of dollars? Will custom silicon prove economically superior to Nvidia GPUs? How will model architectures evolve?For now, Google appears committed to a strategy that has defined the company for decades: building custom infrastructure to enable applications impossible on commodity hardware, then making that infrastructure available to customers who want similar capabilities without the capital investment.As the AI industry transitions from research labs to production deployments serving billions of users, that infrastructure layer — the silicon, software, networking, power, and cooling that make it all run — may prove as important as the models themselves.And if Anthropic&#x27;s willingness to commit to accessing up to one million chips is any indication, Google&#x27;s bet on custom silicon designed specifically for the age of inference may be paying off just as demand reaches its inflection point.",

          "standfirst": "A Wi-Fi mesh system is one of the best upgrades you can make to improve your home’s internet coverage, especially if you’ve ever struggled with dead zones, buffering or dropped video calls. Unlike a single router that broadcasts from one central point, a mesh system uses multiple access points spread throughout your space to blanket your entire home with a strong, seamless Wi-Fi signal. Whether you're working on multiple laptops, streaming 4K video in the living room or gaming online in the basement, a mesh setup helps ensure you get reliable Wi-Fi wherever you are.These systems are designed to handle the demands of modern households, offering features like dual-band or even tri-band connectivity to balance your bandwidth across devices, and automatic updates to keep your firmware current. Many also support high-speed internet plans and include options for a wired connection if you need extra stability for gaming or work. With easy setup, smart app controls and long-term future-proofing, the best mesh Wi-Fi router systems can eliminate the need for clunky Wi-Fi extenders and give you fast, dependable Wi-Fi connections across your whole home. Table of contents Best mesh Wi-Fi systems for 2025 What to look for in a mesh Wi-Fi system Other mesh Wi-Fi router systems we tested How we test Wi-Fi routers Mesh Wi-Fi system FAQs Best mesh Wi-Fi systems for 2025 What to look for in a mesh Wi-Fi system Linksys’ CEO Jonathan Bettino told Engadget why mesh systems are an “advancement in Wi-Fi technology” over buying a single point router. With one transmitter, the signal can degrade the further away from the router you go, or the local environment isn’t ideal. “You can have a small [home], but there’s thick walls [...] or things in the way that just interfere with your wireless signal,” he said. Historically, the solution to a home’s Wi-Fi dead zone was to buy a Wi-Fi extender but Bettino said the hardware has both a “terrible user experience” and one of the highest return rates of any consumer electronics product. Mesh Wi-Fi, by comparison, offers “multiple nodes that can be placed anywhere in your home,” says Bettino, resulting in “ubiquitous Wi-Fi” that feels as if you have a “router in every room.” Rather than having one main router in your home, having a “router in every room” is the biggest selling point for mesh Wi-Fi given how reliant we all are on the internet. Each node is in constant contact with each other, broadcasting a single, seamless network to all of your connected devices. There’s no separate network for the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, just a single name that you connect to. It’s a good time to buy a mesh Wi-Fi system since the latest standard, Wi-Fi 6E, represents a big leap in the technology. Matt MacPherson, Cisco's Chief Technology Officer for Wireless, said Wi-Fi 6E is a big “inflection point,” using much more of the wireless spectrum than its predecessors. “If you’re using that spectrum with a Wi-Fi 6 [device],” he said, “you’re going to get significant gains [in speed.]” MacPherson added Wi-Fi 6E will likely “carry you for a long time” thanks to the fact its “top throughputs now typically exceed what people can actually connect their home to.” In short, with a top theoretical per-stream speed of 1.2 Gbps, Wi-Fi 6E is fast enough to outrun all but the fastest internet service. What do all these Wi-Fi numbers and letters mean? I’m sorry folks, we need to get boringly technical for one paragraph, but I promise you it’s worth it. Wi-Fi is governed by International Standard IEEE 802.11, and every few years a letter gets added onto that name when the technology evolves and improves. Until 2019, routers were sold under their IEEE name, leaving users to pick through the word soup of a product labeled 802.11 b/g/a/n/ac and so on. Mercifully, wiser heads opted to rebrand the letters as numbers, so rather than 802.11 b/g/a/n/ac, we have Wi-Fi 1, 2, 3 4 and 5. Right now, we’re in the middle of one of those Wi-Fi generations, with most of the gear on sale right now supporting either Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6E. What’s the difference between Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E? Wi-Fi uses chunks of the radio frequency spectrum, with Wi-Fi 6 using the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands to pump data around. In fact, back in the old days, it was likely your home router would offer you the choice of the 2.4GHz or the 5GHz network, as separate bands to access. These days, all of the spectrums are tied together as one thing, and Wi-Fi 6E has the added ability to use the 6GHz band as well. That’s a big chunk of extra wireless real estate that isn’t as cluttered up as the 2.4 and 5GHz bands. You’re going to talk about wireless frequencies now, aren’t you. Each Wi-Fi band had tradeoffs, because the slower radio frequencies have greater range but less speed. 2.4GHz signals will travel a long way in your home but aren’t quick, while 6GHz is blisteringly fast but can be defeated by a sturdy brick wall. A lot of Wi-Fi-enabled gear you own, like smart home products, only use the 2.4GHz band because the range is better and it’s a lot cheaper. But it means that the band is also overcrowded and slow, making it great for your doorbell and robovac, but lackluster for Twitch streaming. So, what am I looking for? Right now, the market is full of mature Wi-Fi 6 and 6E devices, and most new systems available to buy are capable of taking advantage of the faster speeds they offer. This guide focuses on Wi-Fi 6E gear since it’s what we think it’s more than enough to satisfy almost everyone’s at-home Wi-Fi needs. What about Wi-Fi 7? We’re now seeing the first generation of Wi-Fi 7 devices available to buy, but we don’t recommend you do so immediately. The Wi-Fi 7 standard is still so new that there’s little to no reason for you to rush out and buy one for your home. The hardware is tremendously expensive and while Wi-Fi 7 will, eventually, offer some great benefits over 6E, it’s not as transformative an upgrade as 6E. Not to mention, Wi-Fi 7 is so new that almost none of your home’s devices will be able to take advantage of its big-ticket features. I’d estimate you won’t need to worry about upgrading to Wi-Fi 7 for at least five years, if not longer. Range and speed All Wi-Fi routers boast a theoretical broadcast range and a theoretical top speed, and in some cases external antennas to boost signal directionality — but these figures don’t mean much. After all, manufacturers can’t control your ISP’s real speed, the materials and layout of your home or where you put your Wi-Fi gear. Raw speed isn’t everything, either, and you likely need a lot less than the internet speeds your provider is advertising. What matters more is how consistent your connection is between rooms and across devices.. After all, Netflix needs just 15 Mbps to push a single 4K video stream to your home. As cool as it is to say you’ve got all these hundreds of Mbps, factors like latency and reliability are far more crucial to a happy internet life. And unless you have Gigabit internet that can reach speeds of up to 1 Gbps, you won’t need a mesh router that offers that spec. Backhaul Mesh Wi-Fi systems work by connecting every hardware node to a single wireless network, letting them all communicate with each other. Imagine four people in a busy, noisy restaurant all trying to order their dinner from a weary staff member, all at once. Now imagine, while this is going on, that four more people at that same table are also trying to tell a funny anecdote. It’s no surprise that it might take a long time for the right information to reach its intended destination. To combat this, higher-end mesh routers offer dedicated wireless backhaul; a slice of the spectrum for node-to-node communication. So rather than everyone talking at once in the same space, the conversations are essentially separated, reducing the invisible clutter in the air. Because there’s less confusing cross-chatter, everything moves faster, offering a significant performance boost to those systems. Connectivity These days, even your washing machine can have a wireless connection, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore the joys of wired internet. No matter how fast Wi-Fi is, a hard line will always be faster, and some gear, like Philips’ Hue bridge, still needs an ethernet connection. Plenty of routers can also use these hard connections as backhaul, eliminating further wireless clutter. It’s convenient for spread-out systems and power users, but it will mean running more wires through your home. The most common standard is Cat 5e, or gigabit ethernet which, unsurprisingly, has a top speed of 1 Gigabit per second (Gbps). Since Ethernet cables are backward compatible, you should be able to easily find one that works with your system. However, to get the most out of your mesh routers, it’s worth investing in an Ethernet cable that meets the standard your router uses — if it’s Cat 5e, use a Cat 5e cable. You can check your router’s specs via the manufacturer’s website to be sure. Flexibility and scalability Mesh routers enable you to add (or subtract) modules from your home network to suit your needs. D-Link’s Alan Jones said users should “check how scalable the prospective product is” before you buy. This sense of scale doesn’t just apply to the number of nodes on the network, but how many simultaneous connections it can handle. It’s also worth looking at ASUS’ AiMesh products, which can combine mesh Wi-Fi gear and its standard “spider” Wi-Fi routers. If you’ve got a tricky part of your home, you can bolt on an ultra-power standalone Wi-Fi router to a compatible mesh. Placement Mesh networks replace one big piece of hardware with a series of identical nodes that you scatter around your home. You connect one to your modem (usually over ethernet), and then scatter the rest around the place for the best coverage. A good rule of thumb is to place each node no more than two rooms away from the last one, rather than sticking them at the far ends of your home. Bear in mind, every physical obstacle between a Wi-Fi node, its siblings and your devices will hurt your overall performance. You should aim to place them, at the very least, at waist height on furniture in open air, without too many obstructions. The reason many mesh Wi-Fi products are designed to look like an inoffensive white doodad is so you don’t feel compelled to hide them behind your TV. Other mesh Wi-Fi router systems we tested Amazon Eero Pro 7 Eero built its reputation on easy to use yet powerful mesh systems that offer a lot of good in a relatively small and affordable package. Setup is effortless, the app running things is clean and simple, and you get the added benefit of backwards compatibility with older hardware. Sadly, the issue with every Eero system is that so many basic management features, like parental controls, are paywalled behind the company’s Eero Plus subscription for $100 a year. Amazon Eero 6E Eero Pro 6E is an “easy” device, the sort a total novice can set up on their own and thrive with for years on end. There’s little brainwork required to get things set up, and the app has a clean UI with plenty of hand-holding. But, as with the Eero Pro 7, the fact that so many basic management tools are paywalled irks me, especially since you can get plenty of them for free with Google’s rival offering. Netgear Orbi 960 The Orbi 96T0 (RBKE963) is Netgear’s flagship mesh Wi-Fi product, which the company calls the “world’s most powerful Wi-Fi 6E system.” It’s also one of the most expensive consumer-level kits on the market, setting you back $1,499.99 for a three pack. It's a fantastic piece of gear, but it's worth saying that the subset of people who could, would or should buy it remains far smaller than you might expect. Ultimately, I feel that if you’re paying luxury prices, you should expect a luxury product. There were plenty of times during testing that I went looking for a feature that was either only available via the web client, or behind a paywall. While, yes, much of your cash is going to the superlative hardware, but for this sort of money, the fact you have to pay extra for some table-stakes features is insulting. If you’re looking for a new Wi-Fi system and aren’t prepared to spend almost $1,500, it’s worth considering our other top picks for the best Wi-Fi routers and mesh systems. How we test Wi-Fi routers My home covers around 2,200 square feet across three stories with the office on the third floor. It’s relatively long and thin, with the living room at the front of the house, the kitchen at the back and the three bedrooms on the first floor. Its age means there are a lot of solid brick walls, old-school lathe and plaster as well as aluminum foil-backed insulation boards to help with energy efficiency. There are two major Wi-Fi dead zones in the house: The bathroom and the third bedroom behind it, since there’s lots of old and new pipework in the walls and floors. For mesh routers with two nodes, I place the first in my living room, connected via ethernet to my cable modem with the second on the first floor landing in the (ostensible) center of the house. For three-node sets, the third goes in my kitchen, which I’ve found is the optimal layout to get the bulk of my house covered in Wi-Fi. Fundamentally, my home poses enough challenges that if it succeeds here, it stands a very good chance of succeeding in your place. Each mesh is judged on ease of setup, Wi-Fi coverage, reliability, speed and any additional features that it advertises. I look at how user-friendly each companion app is from the perspective of a novice rather than an expert given you shouldn’t need to be a network engineer to do this sort of thing. Tests I do include checking for dead zones, moving from room to room to measure consistency of connectivity and streaming multiple videos at once to replicate common usage patterns. Mesh Wi-Fi system FAQs This is the section of our mesh Wi-Fi buyer’s guide where we talk about the stuff that most people just glide past. If you’re not familiar with technology, it can be intimidating if people talk about these things as if you’re expected to already know. So here’s a very simple, very basic rundown of some of the stuff you might have missed in very basic terms. What’s the difference between a Wi-Fi router and a mesh router? A Wi-Fi router is a box that usually sits close to wherever the internet comes into your home and pumps out information over radio waves. A mesh router, meanwhile, is a set of smaller devices, one of which sits next to your internet connection while the rest are scattered around your home. A single Wi-Fi router is great if your home is small, your needs aren’t too demanding, or if your home doesn’t have many radio-blocking obstructions that mean those signals can’t reach every corner of your home. But, much like standing next to a radio transmitter and then walking away from it in a straight line, after a while, the signal will degrade. That’s the problem a mesh system is designed to solve, since it will take the signal from your modem and pump to the other mesh devices, known as nodes, in your home. That way, instead of having one big router in one part of your home, you have several small ones that ensure you have good Wi-Fi connectivity all over. It also helps ensure that there’s no risk of dropping your connection as you move around — a mesh router system makes it easy to, for instance, walk from room to room watching Netflix and know you won’t miss a single frame. What's the difference between a Wi-Fi extender and a mesh system? Oh boy. Wi-Fi extenders, or repeaters, are small devices designed to push Wi-Fi a little further than your Wi-Fi router can stretch. They’re cheap, compact and often come in the form of little boxes that sit on your plug sockets with the hope of pushing Wi-Fi to a signal-sparse corner of your home. They are, and I can’t put this delicately enough, often a big pile of rubbish and are often not worth your time. Especially since the price of mesh routers has fallen to within most people’s budgets. What is a wireless backhaul? As we explained above, mesh Wi-Fi systems work by connecting every hardware node to a single wireless network, letting them all communicate with each other. Imagine four people in a busy, noisy restaurant all trying to order their dinner from a weary staff member, all at once. Now imagine, while this is going on, that four more people at that same table are also trying to tell a funny anecdote. It’s no surprise that it might take a long time for the right information to reach its intended destination. To combat this, higher-end mesh routers offer dedicated wireless backhaul; a slice of the spectrum for node-to-node communication. So rather than everyone talking at once in the same space, the conversations are essentially separated, reducing the invisible clutter in the air. Because there’s less confusing cross-chatter, everything moves faster, offering a significant performance boost to those systems. Is it better to hard wire instead of using a mesh Wi-Fi system? This is a great question that doesn’t have a simple answer. It is (almost) always preferable to connect devices with a wire, in this case Ethernet, than to use Wi-Fi. The speeds are faster, it’s more reliable and your data is less vulnerable to the slings and arrows of the laws of physics. Hell, I spent about a year trying to work out how to build an iPhone to Ethernet connector back in the bad old days of Wi-Fi. But your ability to do so depends on your level of DIY skills and / or how much money you want to spend on contractors. Wiring your home for Ethernet if you don’t have the infrastructure already can be a costly and time-consuming process. Particularly if you don’t want ugly wires running along your baseboards and under your carpets or across your hardwood floors. If you’re building your own home or can do some serious DIY, then hard wiring is a fantastic thing to have. It goes wonderfully hand-in-glove with mesh networks too, since you’ll be able to hook up your nodes to the network for even better speeds. But if I’m honest, advances in Wi-Fi technology mean I’d only go for hard wiring if I really believed I needed the sort of speed it offers. Unless you’re a Twitch streamer running your own 24/7 content studio, it’s probably overkill. When we started renovating our 140-year-old home, I had Ethernet installed in the living room, the master and second bedroom and in my office, all at the front of the house. I can’t use it for my mesh since I’d need to put the wiring through the middle of the house. If I ever had the wiring done again, I would do so as I know I’ll instantly see a meaningful improvement in both my connection speed and reliability. But I wouldn’t spend several thousand pounds to have it done just for the sake of it.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html?src=rss",

But, as with the Eero Pro 7, the fact that so many basic management tools are paywalled irks me, especially since you can get plenty of them for free with Google’s rival offering. Netgear Orbi 960 The Orbi 96T0 (RBKE963) is Netgear’s flagship mesh Wi-Fi product, which the company calls the “world’s most powerful Wi-Fi 6E system.” It’s also one of the most expensive consumer-level kits on the market, setting you back $1,499.99 for a three pack. It's a fantastic piece of gear, but it's worth saying that the subset of people who could, would or should buy it remains far smaller than you might expect. Ultimately, I feel that if you’re paying luxury prices, you should expect a luxury product. There were plenty of times during testing that I went looking for a feature that was either only available via the web client, or behind a paywall. While, yes, much of your cash is going to the superlative hardware, but for this sort of money, the fact you have to pay extra for some table-stakes features is insulting. If you’re looking for a new Wi-Fi system and aren’t prepared to spend almost $1,500, it’s worth considering our other top picks for the best Wi-Fi routers and mesh systems. How we test Wi-Fi routers My home covers around 2,200 square feet across three stories with the office on the third floor. It’s relatively long and thin, with the living room at the front of the house, the kitchen at the back and the three bedrooms on the first floor. Its age means there are a lot of solid brick walls, old-school lathe and plaster as well as aluminum foil-backed insulation boards to help with energy efficiency. There are two major Wi-Fi dead zones in the house: The bathroom and the third bedroom behind it, since there’s lots of old and new pipework in the walls and floors. For mesh routers with two nodes, I place the first in my living room, connected via ethernet to my cable modem with the second on the first floor landing in the (ostensible) center of the house. For three-node sets, the third goes in my kitchen, which I’ve found is the optimal layout to get the bulk of my house covered in Wi-Fi. Fundamentally, my home poses enough challenges that if it succeeds here, it stands a very good chance of succeeding in your place. Each mesh is judged on ease of setup, Wi-Fi coverage, reliability, speed and any additional features that it advertises. I look at how user-friendly each companion app is from the perspective of a novice rather than an expert given you shouldn’t need to be a network engineer to do this sort of thing. Tests I do include checking for dead zones, moving from room to room to measure consistency of connectivity and streaming multiple videos at once to replicate common usage patterns. Mesh Wi-Fi system FAQs This is the section of our mesh Wi-Fi buyer’s guide where we talk about the stuff that most people just glide past. If you’re not familiar with technology, it can be intimidating if people talk about these things as if you’re expected to already know. So here’s a very simple, very basic rundown of some of the stuff you might have missed in very basic terms. What’s the difference between a Wi-Fi router and a mesh router? A Wi-Fi router is a box that usually sits close to wherever the internet comes into your home and pumps out information over radio waves. A mesh router, meanwhile, is a set of smaller devices, one of which sits next to your internet connection while the rest are scattered around your home. A single Wi-Fi router is great if your home is small, your needs aren’t too demanding, or if your home doesn’t have many radio-blocking obstructions that mean those signals can’t reach every corner of your home. But, much like standing next to a radio transmitter and then walking away from it in a straight line, after a while, the signal will degrade. That’s the problem a mesh system is designed to solve, since it will take the signal from your modem and pump to the other mesh devices, known as nodes, in your home. That way, instead of having one big router in one part of your home, you have several small ones that ensure you have good Wi-Fi connectivity all over. It also helps ensure that there’s no risk of dropping your connection as you move around — a mesh router system makes it easy to, for instance, walk from room to room watching Netflix and know you won’t miss a single frame. What's the difference between a Wi-Fi extender and a mesh system? Oh boy. Wi-Fi extenders, or repeaters, are small devices designed to push Wi-Fi a little further than your Wi-Fi router can stretch. They’re cheap, compact and often come in the form of little boxes that sit on your plug sockets with the hope of pushing Wi-Fi to a signal-sparse corner of your home. They are, and I can’t put this delicately enough, often a big pile of rubbish and are often not worth your time. Especially since the price of mesh routers has fallen to within most people’s budgets. What is a wireless backhaul? As we explained above, mesh Wi-Fi systems work by connecting every hardware node to a single wireless network, letting them all communicate with each other. Imagine four people in a busy, noisy restaurant all trying to order their dinner from a weary staff member, all at once. Now imagine, while this is going on, that four more people at that same table are also trying to tell a funny anecdote. It’s no surprise that it might take a long time for the right information to reach its intended destination. To combat this, higher-end mesh routers offer dedicated wireless backhaul; a slice of the spectrum for node-to-node communication. So rather than everyone talking at once in the same space, the conversations are essentially separated, reducing the invisible clutter in the air. Because there’s less confusing cross-chatter, everything moves faster, offering a significant performance boost to those systems. Is it better to hard wire instead of using a mesh Wi-Fi system? This is a great question that doesn’t have a simple answer. It is (almost) always preferable to connect devices with a wire, in this case Ethernet, than to use Wi-Fi. The speeds are faster, it’s more reliable and your data is less vulnerable to the slings and arrows of the laws of physics. Hell, I spent about a year trying to work out how to build an iPhone to Ethernet connector back in the bad old days of Wi-Fi. But your ability to do so depends on your level of DIY skills and / or how much money you want to spend on contractors. Wiring your home for Ethernet if you don’t have the infrastructure already can be a costly and time-consuming process. Particularly if you don’t want ugly wires running along your baseboards and under your carpets or across your hardwood floors. If you’re building your own home or can do some serious DIY, then hard wiring is a fantastic thing to have. It goes wonderfully hand-in-glove with mesh networks too, since you’ll be able to hook up your nodes to the network for even better speeds. But if I’m honest, advances in Wi-Fi technology mean I’d only go for hard wiring if I really believed I needed the sort of speed it offers. Unless you’re a Twitch streamer running your own 24/7 content studio, it’s probably overkill. When we started renovating our 140-year-old home, I had Ethernet installed in the living room, the master and second bedroom and in my office, all at the front of the house. I can’t use it for my mesh since I’d need to put the wiring through the middle of the house. If I ever had the wiring done again, I would do so as I know I’ll instantly see a meaningful improvement in both my connection speed and reliability. But I wouldn’t spend several thousand pounds to have it done just for the sake of it.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-mesh-wifi-system-130028701.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Whether you’re a true cord-cutter or you just want to watch the next season of Stranger Things when it drops, everyone’s on the lookout for streaming deals nowadays. Plenty have chosen VOD and live TV streaming services over traditional cable in recent years, but the savings that choice got you just a few years ago have somewhat evaporated now. Companies like Netflix, Disney, Max and others have been consistently raising prices to the point where you may question if streaming is even worth it anymore. We at Engadget still think so, for many reasons, but you can (and should) be smart with your money at the same time. Streaming deals are an option, even if they don’t come around with the same regularity as discounts on AirPods do. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Starz (one year) for $30 ($40 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $5 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Hulu + Live TV — $64.99/mo for 3 months ($25/mo off): New and eligible returning subscribers can get three months of Hulu + Live TV at a rate of $65 per month, which is much cheaper than the current $83-per-month rate and a whopping 27 percent off the new $90-per-month rate that kicks in on October 21. In addition to live TV content, unlimited DVR and access to more than 95 live TV channels, this service also includes Disney+ and ESPN Select, so you're essentially getting three separate streaming services under this umbrella. Just remember that your subscription will be billed at the new standard $90/month rate after the first three months. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. Spotify Premium Individual (one month) for $0 ($12 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Disney+ If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out who Pepe Silvia is when you look at Disney's streaming prices chart, you're not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here's a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing. Disney+ and Hulu bundle (with ads) — $13/month Disney+ and Hulu bundle (without ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (without ads on Disney+ and Hulu only) — $30/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (without ads) — $33/month Peacock TV Peacock doesn't have any streaming bundles available all year round, but you can save if you pay for one year upfront. Peacock Select (with ads) — $8/month or $80/year Peacock Premium (with ads) — $11/month or $110/year Peacock Premium Plus (without ads) — $17/month or $170/year Paramount+ Paramount+ used to bill its tier with Showtime as a sort of bundle, but it has since renamed its plans and focused the Showtime inclusion in its premium tier as just another bonus of paying for the higher priced plan. Paramount+ Essential (with ads) —$8/month or $60/year Paramount Premium (without ads) — $13/month or $120/year Student discounts on streaming services It pays to be a student — sometimes, at least. A number of streaming services have student discounts you can take advantage of as long as you're actively studying. What that translates to most of the time is being able to verify your student status and signing up with your .edu email address. HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.

          "title": "From prototype to production: What vibe coding tools must fix for enterprise adoption",
          "standfirst": "Presented by Salesforce Vibe coding — the fast-growing trend of using generative AI to spin up code from plain-language prompts — is quick, creative, and great for instant prototypes. But many argue that it&#x27;s not cut out for building production-ready business apps with the security, governance, and trusted infrastructure that enterprises require. In other words, a few saved hours in development can mean a future full of security vulnerabilities, endless maintenance, and scalability headaches, says Mohith Shrivastava, principal developer advocate at Salesforce.\"For rapid experimentation, building minimum viable products, and tackling creative challenges, vibe coding is a game-changer,\" Shrivastava says. \"However, that same speed and improvisational nature are exactly what makes its application in a professional, enterprise setting a topic of intense debate. And the skepticism from the developer community is 100% justified.\"Risks and rewards of vibe coding The excitement is all about speed: going from a rough idea to a working prototype in hours, not weeks, is a massive advantage. But as Shrivastava shared, developers have been vocal about the potential downsides.\"When you apply vibe coding indiscriminately to an entire application stack, you’re not just moving fast; you’re accumulating risk at an unprecedented rate,\" Shrivastava explains. \"The cons are significant.\" That includes potential security nightmares, as AI models don&#x27;t typically take into consideration the company&#x27;s specific security policies. They can easily introduce vulnerabilities like hardcoded secrets or use insecure, hallucinated packages. Then there’s the issue of what Shrivastava calls \"spaghetti code on steroids,\" or verbose code that lacks a coherent architectural pattern, creating a mountain of technical debt.Equally concerning is the illusion of progress: vibe coding may complete 80% of a feature in record time, but the remaining 20% — the edge cases, performance tuning, and compliance work — becomes exponentially harder.But does this mean vibe coding has no place in the enterprise?\"The idea that you can just vibe your way to a complex, secure, and maintainable enterprise application is a dangerous fantasy,\" Shrivastava says. \"But — the pros are undeniable if it&#x27;s used correctly. The key is not to avoid vibe coding, but to apply it intelligently in your enterprise.\"Red and green zones: Enterprise-grade vibe codingYou can&#x27;t, and you absolutely should not, vibe code your entire enterprise stack with just any generic tool, Shrivastava warns. But when paired with no-, low-, or pro-code tools that are built for the enterprise, many of the gaps can be addressed. An enterprise-grade vibe coding solution, for example, can automatically scan for security issues, flag performance bottlenecks, and provide a safety net. It’s also critical to understand which parts of an application suit this approach — and which demand a higher level of trust and control. Shrivastava divides the stack into red and green zones to illustrate.The green zone is the presentation layer, or the UI and UX. It’s ideal for vibe coding, where developers can move fast and iterate quickly without much risk. In contrast is the red zone, which covers the foundational pillars of an application, including business logic and data layers.Empowering developers in the green zoneDeveloper expertise remains the foundation for effective and safe vibe coding. But developers can be amplified by AI tools and emerging agents that are grounded in business context, connected to real applications, integrations, and data flows.\"A generic AI agent can&#x27;t grasp your company&#x27;s unique processes, but a context-aware tool can act as a powerful pair programmer, helping a developer draft complex logic or model data with greater speed and accuracy,\" Shrivastava says. \"It’s about making the expert developer more efficient, not trying to do their job for them.\"Some areas will always be high risk for ungoverned AI — especially infrastructure and security. Letting a generic AI agent configure firewalls or Identity and Access Management [IAM] policies without oversight, Shrivastava warns, is a recipe for disaster. The solution isn’t to avoid the red zone entirely, but to approach it with the right tools — ones that embed governance, security, and context from the ground up.\"The winning strategy is clear: Vibe code the green zone for agility, approach the red zone by augmenting your developers with powerful, context-aware tools, and never, ever DIY your core infrastructure with AI,\" he says.Embracing enterprise vibe codingTo harness the power of enterprise vibe coding, Salesforce developed Agentforce Vibes. This new vibe coding offering for the enterprise includes Agentforce, an autonomous AI agent built to collaborate like a pair programmer on the Salesforce Platform. It’s designed precisely to provide developers with the right tools for the job, covering both the green and red zones. For the green zone, it offers the speed and agility to rapidly build UIs and prototypes. But its true power lies in how it augments developers in the red zone.\"Enterprise vibe coding like Agentforce lets organizations take AI-assisted development to the organizational level, accelerating coding, testing, and deployment, while ensuring consistency, security, and performance,\" says Dan Fernandez, VP of product, developer services at Salesforce. \"It&#x27;s not about throwing away governance for speed; it’s about integrating AI into every stage of the application lifecycle to work smarter.\"Because Agentforce Vibes’ tooling is deeply integrated with your business context on the platform, it can safely assist with business logic and data modeling. Most importantly, it operates on a trusted platform. Instead of a DIY approach — jury-rigging a generic AI agent to handle your networking — developers build on a foundation that has security and governance built in, so they can innovate safely, knowing the most critical layers of the stack are secure and compliant.Major enterprises are putting vibe coding to work Agentforce Vibes users are now tapping the tool to build around 20 to 25% of their new code base, according to Salesforce data, and users are accepting around 1.2 million lines of agentic code per month. That includes companies like Coinbase, CGI, Grupo Globo, and one of the top five banks in the U.S., which is using Agentforce Vibes capabilities to develop production-ready apps faster. Agentforce Vibes is part of a suite of tools in Agentforce 360 that span from no-code and low-code to pro-code development. These tools are together helping customers develop and deploy at speeds previously unheard of.With the low-code Agent Builder in Agentforce, the Secret Escapes team was able to build, test, and launch their agent to support customer service in just two weeks, compared to the six months it had previously taken the company to build and train a bot. With Agentforce, 1-800Accountant autonomously resolved 70% of customer chat engagements during tax week in 2025, without writing a line of code, using Salesforce’s low-code tools and AI assistance. Meanwhile, media company Grupo Globo deployed agents to identify subscribers at risk of lapsing, offer personalized upgrades, cross-sell, and convert non-subscribers. As a result, Agentforce boosted Globo’s retention rates by 22% in less than three months.Innovation meets discipline Enterprise tools show that disciplined engineering and creative experimentation can coexist — and that balance, Shrivastava says, is the key to lasting innovation.\"Vibe coding is not a fad, but it&#x27;s also not a silver bullet that will replace disciplined software engineering,\" Shrivastava says. \"The smart path forward is a hybrid approach where human software skills are augmented with agentic intelligence. This balanced approach is how you get the best of both worlds: radical innovation at the edge and unwavering stability at the core.\"Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

And the skepticism from the developer community is 100% justified.\"Risks and rewards of vibe coding The excitement is all about speed: going from a rough idea to a working prototype in hours, not weeks, is a massive advantage. But as Shrivastava shared, developers have been vocal about the potential downsides.\"When you apply vibe coding indiscriminately to an entire application stack, you’re not just moving fast; you’re accumulating risk at an unprecedented rate,\" Shrivastava explains. \"The cons are significant.\" That includes potential security nightmares, as AI models don&#x27;t typically take into consideration the company&#x27;s specific security policies. They can easily introduce vulnerabilities like hardcoded secrets or use insecure, hallucinated packages. Then there’s the issue of what Shrivastava calls \"spaghetti code on steroids,\" or verbose code that lacks a coherent architectural pattern, creating a mountain of technical debt.Equally concerning is the illusion of progress: vibe coding may complete 80% of a feature in record time, but the remaining 20% — the edge cases, performance tuning, and compliance work — becomes exponentially harder.But does this mean vibe coding has no place in the enterprise?\"The idea that you can just vibe your way to a complex, secure, and maintainable enterprise application is a dangerous fantasy,\" Shrivastava says. \"But — the pros are undeniable if it&#x27;s used correctly. The key is not to avoid vibe coding, but to apply it intelligently in your enterprise.\"Red and green zones: Enterprise-grade vibe codingYou can&#x27;t, and you absolutely should not, vibe code your entire enterprise stack with just any generic tool, Shrivastava warns. But when paired with no-, low-, or pro-code tools that are built for the enterprise, many of the gaps can be addressed. An enterprise-grade vibe coding solution, for example, can automatically scan for security issues, flag performance bottlenecks, and provide a safety net. It’s also critical to understand which parts of an application suit this approach — and which demand a higher level of trust and control. Shrivastava divides the stack into red and green zones to illustrate.The green zone is the presentation layer, or the UI and UX. It’s ideal for vibe coding, where developers can move fast and iterate quickly without much risk. In contrast is the red zone, which covers the foundational pillars of an application, including business logic and data layers.Empowering developers in the green zoneDeveloper expertise remains the foundation for effective and safe vibe coding. But developers can be amplified by AI tools and emerging agents that are grounded in business context, connected to real applications, integrations, and data flows.\"A generic AI agent can&#x27;t grasp your company&#x27;s unique processes, but a context-aware tool can act as a powerful pair programmer, helping a developer draft complex logic or model data with greater speed and accuracy,\" Shrivastava says. \"It’s about making the expert developer more efficient, not trying to do their job for them.\"Some areas will always be high risk for ungoverned AI — especially infrastructure and security. Letting a generic AI agent configure firewalls or Identity and Access Management [IAM] policies without oversight, Shrivastava warns, is a recipe for disaster. The solution isn’t to avoid the red zone entirely, but to approach it with the right tools — ones that embed governance, security, and context from the ground up.\"The winning strategy is clear: Vibe code the green zone for agility, approach the red zone by augmenting your developers with powerful, context-aware tools, and never, ever DIY your core infrastructure with AI,\" he says.Embracing enterprise vibe codingTo harness the power of enterprise vibe coding, Salesforce developed Agentforce Vibes. This new vibe coding offering for the enterprise includes Agentforce, an autonomous AI agent built to collaborate like a pair programmer on the Salesforce Platform. It’s designed precisely to provide developers with the right tools for the job, covering both the green and red zones. For the green zone, it offers the speed and agility to rapidly build UIs and prototypes. But its true power lies in how it augments developers in the red zone.\"Enterprise vibe coding like Agentforce lets organizations take AI-assisted development to the organizational level, accelerating coding, testing, and deployment, while ensuring consistency, security, and performance,\" says Dan Fernandez, VP of product, developer services at Salesforce. \"It&#x27;s not about throwing away governance for speed; it’s about integrating AI into every stage of the application lifecycle to work smarter.\"Because Agentforce Vibes’ tooling is deeply integrated with your business context on the platform, it can safely assist with business logic and data modeling. Most importantly, it operates on a trusted platform. Instead of a DIY approach — jury-rigging a generic AI agent to handle your networking — developers build on a foundation that has security and governance built in, so they can innovate safely, knowing the most critical layers of the stack are secure and compliant.Major enterprises are putting vibe coding to work Agentforce Vibes users are now tapping the tool to build around 20 to 25% of their new code base, according to Salesforce data, and users are accepting around 1.2 million lines of agentic code per month. That includes companies like Coinbase, CGI, Grupo Globo, and one of the top five banks in the U.S., which is using Agentforce Vibes capabilities to develop production-ready apps faster. Agentforce Vibes is part of a suite of tools in Agentforce 360 that span from no-code and low-code to pro-code development. These tools are together helping customers develop and deploy at speeds previously unheard of.With the low-code Agent Builder in Agentforce, the Secret Escapes team was able to build, test, and launch their agent to support customer service in just two weeks, compared to the six months it had previously taken the company to build and train a bot. With Agentforce, 1-800Accountant autonomously resolved 70% of customer chat engagements during tax week in 2025, without writing a line of code, using Salesforce’s low-code tools and AI assistance. Meanwhile, media company Grupo Globo deployed agents to identify subscribers at risk of lapsing, offer personalized upgrades, cross-sell, and convert non-subscribers. As a result, Agentforce boosted Globo’s retention rates by 22% in less than three months.Innovation meets discipline Enterprise tools show that disciplined engineering and creative experimentation can coexist — and that balance, Shrivastava says, is the key to lasting innovation.\"Vibe coding is not a fad, but it&#x27;s also not a silver bullet that will replace disciplined software engineering,\" Shrivastava says. \"The smart path forward is a hybrid approach where human software skills are augmented with agentic intelligence. This balanced approach is how you get the best of both worlds: radical innovation at the edge and unwavering stability at the core.\"Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

          "standfirst": "By now, enterprises understand that retrieval augmented generation (RAG) allows applications and agents to find the best, most grounded information for queries. However, typical RAG setups could be an engineering challenge and also exhibit undesirable traits. To help solve this, Google released the File Search Tool on the Gemini API, a fully managed RAG system “that abstracts away the retrieval pipeline.” File Search removes much of the tool and application-gathering involved in setting up RAG pipelines, so engineers don’t need to stitch together things like storage solutions and embedding creators. This tool competes directly with enterprise RAG products from OpenAI, AWS and Microsoft, which also aim to simplify RAG architecture. Google, though, claims its offering requires less orchestration and is more standalone. “File Search provides a simple, integrated and scalable way to ground Gemini with your data, delivering responses that are more accurate, relevant and verifiable,” Google said in a blog post. Enterprises can access some features of File Search, such as storage and embedding generation, for free at query time. Users will begin paying for embeddings when these files are indexed at a fixed rate of $0.15 per 1 million tokens. Google’s Gemini Embedding model, which eventually became the top embedding model on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark, powers File Search. File Search and integrated experiences Google said File Search works “by handling the complexities of RAG for you.” File Search manages file storage, chunking strategies and embeddings. Developers can invoke File Search within the existing generateContent API, which Google said makes the tool easier to adopt. File Search uses vector search to “understand the meaning and context of a user’s query.” Ideally, it will find the relevant information to answer a query from documents, even if the prompt contains inexact words. The feature has built-in citations that point to the specific parts of a document it used to generate answers, and also supports a variety of file formats. These include PDF, Docx, txt, JSON and “many common programming language file types,\" Google says. Continuous RAG experimentation Enterprises may have already begun building out a RAG pipeline as they lay the groundwork for their AI agents to actually tap the correct data and make informed decisions. Because RAG represents a key part of how enterprises maintain accuracy and tap into insights about their business, organizations must quickly have visibility into this pipeline. RAG can be an engineering pain because orchestrating multiple tools together can become complicated. Building “traditional” RAG pipelines means organizations must assemble and fine-tune a file ingestion and parsing program, including chunking, embedding generation and updates. They must then contract a vector database like Pinecone, determine its retrieval logic, and fit it all within a model’s context window. Additionally, they can, if desired, add source citations. File Search aims to streamline all of that, although competitor platforms offer similar features. OpenAI’s Assistants API allows developers to utilize a file search feature, guiding an agent to relevant documents for responses. AWS’s Bedrock unveiled a data automation managed service in December. While File Search stands similarly to these other platforms, Google’s offering abstracts all, rather than just some, elements of the RAG pipeline creation. Phaser Studio, the creator of AI-driven game generation platform Beam, said in Google’s blog that it used File Search to sift through its library of 3,000 files.“File Search allows us to instantly surface the right material, whether that’s a code snippet for bullet patterns, genre templates or architectural guidance from our Phaser ‘brain’ corpus,” said Phaser CTO Richard Davey. “The result is ideas that once took days to prototype now become playable in minutes.”Since the announcement, several users expressed interest in using the feature.",

Increasingly, it’s running directly where data is created — in devices, sensors, and networks at the edge. This shift toward on-device intelligence is being driven by latency, privacy, and cost concerns that companies are confronting as they continue their investments in AI. For leadership teams, the opportunity is clear, says Chris Bergey, SVP and GM, of Arm’s Client Business: Invest in AI-first platforms that complement cloud usage, deliver real-time responsiveness, and protect sensitive data. \"With the explosion of connected devices and the rise of IoT, edge AI provides a significant opportunity for organizations to gain a competitive edge through faster, more efficient AI,\" Bergey explains. \"Those who move first aren’t just improving efficiency, they’re redefining what customers expect. AI is becoming a differentiator in trust, responsiveness, and innovation. The sooner a business makes AI central to its workflows, the faster it compounds that advantage.\" Use cases: Deploying AI where data livesEnterprises are discovering that edge AI isn’t just a performance boost — it’s a new operational model. Processing locally means less dependency on the cloud and faster, safer decision-making in real time. For instance, a factory floor can analyze equipment data instantly to prevent downtime, while a hospital can run diagnostic models securely on-site. Retailers are deploying in-store analytics using vision systems while logistic companies are using on-device AI to optimize fleet operations. Instead of sending vast data volumes to the cloud, organizations can analyze and act on insights where they emerge. The result is a more responsive, privacy-preserving, and cost-effective AI architecture.The consumer expectation: Immediacy and trustWorking with Alibaba’s Taobao team, the largest Chinese ecommerce platform, Arm (Nasdaq:Arm) enabled on-device product recommendations that update instantly without depending on the cloud. This helped online shoppers find what they need faster while keeping browsing data private.Another example comes from consumer tech: Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasses, which blend cloud and on-device AI. The glasses handle quick commands locally for faster responses, while heavier tasks like translation and visual recognition are processed in the cloud.\"Every major technology shift has created new ways to engage and monetize,\" Bergey says. \"As AI capabilities and user expectations grow, more intelligence will need to move closer to the edge to deliver this kind of immediacy and trust that people now expect.\" This shift is also taking place with the tools people use every day. Assistants like Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini are blending cloud and on-device intelligence to bring generative AI closer to the user, delivering faster, more secure, and more context-aware experiences. That same principle applies across industries: the more intelligence you move safely and efficiently to the edge, the more responsive, private, and valuable your operations become. Building smarter for scaleThe explosion of AI at the edge demands not only smarter chips but smarter infrastructure. By aligning compute power with workload demands, enterprises can reduce energy consumption while maintaining high performance. This balance of sustainability and scale is fast becoming a competitive differentiator.\"Compute needs, whether in the cloud or on-premises, will continue to rise sharply. The question becomes, how do you maximize value from that compute?\" he said. \"You can only do this by investing in compute platforms and software that scale with your AI ambitions. The real measure of progress is enterprise value creation, not raw efficiency metrics.\"The intelligent foundationThe rapid evolution of AI models, especially those powering edge inferencing, multimodal applications, and low-latency responses, demands not just smarter algorithms, but a foundation of highly performant, energy-efficient hardware. As workloads grow more diverse and distributed, legacy architectures designed for traditional workloads are no longer adequate. The role of CPUs is evolving, and they now sit at the center of increasingly heterogenous systems that deliver advanced on-device AI experiences. Thanks to their flexibility, efficiency, and mature software support, modern CPUs can run everything from classic machine learning to complex generative AI workloads. When paired with accelerators such as NPUs or GPUs, they intelligently coordinate compute across the system — ensuring the right workload runs on the right engine for maximum performance and efficiency. The CPU continues to be the foundation that enables scalable, efficient AI everywhere.Technologies like Arm’s Scalable Matrix Extension 2 (SME2) bring advanced matrix acceleration to Armv9 CPUs. Meanwhile, Arm KleidiAI, its intelligent software layer, is extensively integrated across leading frameworks to automatically boost performance for a wide range of AI workloads, from language models to speech recognition to computer vision, running on Arm-based edge devices — without needing developers to rewrite their code.\"These technologies ensure that AI frameworks can tap into the full performance of Arm-based systems without extra developer effort,\" he says. \"It’s how we make AI both scalable and sustainable: by embedding intelligence into the foundation of modern compute, so innovation happens at the speed of software, not hardware cycles.\"That democratization of compute power is also what will facilitate the next wave of intelligent, real-time experiences across the enterprise, not just in flagship products, but across entire device portfolios. The evolution of edge AI As AI moves from isolated pilots to full-scale deployment, the enterprises that succeed will be those that connect intelligence across every layer of infrastructure. Agentic AI systems will depend on this seamless integration — enabling autonomous processes that can reason, coordinate, and deliver value instantly.\"The pattern is familiar as in every disruptive wave, incumbents that move slowly risk being overtaken by new entrants,\" he says. \"The companies that thrive will be the ones that wake up every morning asking how to make their organization AI-first. As with the rise of the internet and cloud computing, those who lean in and truly become AI-enabled will shape the next decade.\"Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

          "standfirst": "Foursquare founder Dennis Crowley has unveiled his latest venture and yes, it's another location-based social app. But, rather than the check-ins Crowley first popularized more than 15 years ago, \"BeeBot\" has a very 2025 take on the concept. Instead, the app is an AI-powered \"DJ\" that can deliver contextual audio updates to your ears as you move through your day. Crowley describes BeeBot as an \"app for AirPods,\" though it will work with any type of headphones, as well as smart glasses with audio capabilities like Meta's. \"Whenever you put your AirPods in, it turns on,\" Crowley explains in a post on Medium. \"Whenever you take your AirPods out it turns off. And when it’s 'on' it’ll push you snippets of audio about the people, places, and events that are nearby.'To do this, you'll need to give the app access to your location and share a handful of \"keywords\" about your interests. You can also share your contacts to get updates from friends who are using the app. The BeeBot \"DJ,\" which of course has an AI voice, will then be able to talk to you as you throughout the dat and alert you to interesting events, landmarks or updates from friends who happen to be nearby. In some ways, it sounds like Crowley is trying to re-create some of the serendipitous IRL social interactions enabled by the original version of Foursquare. BeeBot doesn't have \"mayorships,\" badges or any of the gamification features that helped popularize FourSquare, but it's meant to have some of the \"same playful spirit,\" of OG Foursquare, according to Crowley. (Foursquare shut down its city guide app of the same name earlier this year, though its check-in app, Swarm, lives on.) And, because it's 2025, there's also a whole bunch of AI thrown in, including \"a mix of different LLMs\" and \"synthetic voices.\" The app is \"powered by a TikTok-style algorithm,\" Crowley says, \"but one that’s focused on what’s happening nearby and IRL.\" There also seems to be a bit of DNA from Marsbot, the short-lived (and IMO very underrated) chat-based app Foursquare launched in 2016 that could proactively provide personalized restaurant recommendations. While BeeBot isn't as heavily focused on neighborhood recommendations as Foursquare, it is meant to proactively let you know about nearby happenings you might be interested in or even a bit of gossip from friends. In addition to friends' status updates, the app will draw on local Substacks and newsletters for relevant info about a given area. Crowley says the DJ's audio cues may \"occasionally\" interrupt your music or podcast to give an update, though users should expect to hear these only a couple times throughout the day. BeeBot won't interrupt voice or video calls. BeeBot, which is the inaugural project of Crowley's new company Hopscotch Labs, is out now in the App Store, though it's still \"very much a work in progress,\" according to Crowley. \"I feel like the version of the product we’re sharing with folks today is kind of where Foursquare was when it launched at SXSW in 2009 – an interesting vision, a good-enough execution, but something that still needs to be shaped by the people using it to fully blossom.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-foursquare-founders-new-app-is-an-ai-powered-dj-for-neighborhood-updates-202326296.html?src=rss",

And, because it's 2025, there's also a whole bunch of AI thrown in, including \"a mix of different LLMs\" and \"synthetic voices.\" The app is \"powered by a TikTok-style algorithm,\" Crowley says, \"but one that’s focused on what’s happening nearby and IRL.\" There also seems to be a bit of DNA from Marsbot, the short-lived (and IMO very underrated) chat-based app Foursquare launched in 2016 that could proactively provide personalized restaurant recommendations. While BeeBot isn't as heavily focused on neighborhood recommendations as Foursquare, it is meant to proactively let you know about nearby happenings you might be interested in or even a bit of gossip from friends. In addition to friends' status updates, the app will draw on local Substacks and newsletters for relevant info about a given area. Crowley says the DJ's audio cues may \"occasionally\" interrupt your music or podcast to give an update, though users should expect to hear these only a couple times throughout the day. BeeBot won't interrupt voice or video calls. BeeBot, which is the inaugural project of Crowley's new company Hopscotch Labs, is out now in the App Store, though it's still \"very much a work in progress,\" according to Crowley. \"I feel like the version of the product we’re sharing with folks today is kind of where Foursquare was when it launched at SXSW in 2009 – an interesting vision, a good-enough execution, but something that still needs to be shaped by the people using it to fully blossom.\" This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-foursquare-founders-new-app-is-an-ai-powered-dj-for-neighborhood-updates-202326296.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Google Cloud has introduced a big update in a bid to keep AI developers on its Vertex AI platform for concepting, designing, building, testing, deploying and modifying AI agents in enterprise use cases.The new features, announced today, include additional governance tools for enterprises and expanding the capabilities for creating agents with just a few lines of code, moving faster with state-of-the-art context management layers and one-click deployment, as well as managed services for scaling production and evaluation, and support for identifying agents.Agent Builder, released last year during its annual Cloud Next event, provides a no-code platform for enterprises to create agents and connect these to orchestration frameworks like LangChain.Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK), which lets developers build agents “in under 100 lines of code,” can also be accessed through Agent Builder. “These new capabilities underscore our commitment to Agent Builder, and simplify the agent development process to meet developers where they are, no matter which tech stack they choose,” said Mike Clark, director of Product Management, Vertex AI Agent Builder. Build agents fasterPart of Google’s pitch for Agent Builder’s new features is that enterprises can bake in-orchestration even as they construct their agents. “Building an agent from a concept to a working product involves complex orchestration,” said Clark. The new capabilities, which are shipped with the ADK, include:SOTA context management layers including Static, Turn, User and Cache layers so enterprises have more control over the agents’ contextPrebuilt plugins with customizable logic. One of the new plugins allows agents to recognize failed tool calls and “self-heal” by retrying the task with a different approachAdditional language support in ADK, including Go, alongside Python and Java, that launched with ADKOne-click deployment through the ADK command line interface to move agents from a local environment to live testing with a single commandGovernance layerEnterprises require high accuracy; security; observability and auditability (what a program did and why); and steerability (control) in their production-grade AI agents.While Google had observability features in the local development environment at launch, developers can now access these tools through the Agent Engine managed runtime dashboard. The company said this brings cloud-based production monitoring to track token consumption, error rates and latency. Within this observability dashboard, enterprises can visualize the actions agents take and reproduce any issues. Agent Engine will also have a new Evaluation Layer to help “simulate agent performance across a vast array of user interactions and situations.”This governance layer will also include:Agent Identities that Google said give “agents their own unique, native identities within Google Cloud Model Armor, which would block prompt injections, screen tool calls and agent responsesSecurity Command Center, so admins can build an inventory of their agents to detect threats like unauthorized access“These native identities provide a deep, built-in layer of control and a clear audit trail for all agent actions. These certificate-backed identities further strengthen your security as they cannot be impersonated and are tied directly to the agent&#x27;s lifecycle, eliminating the risk of dormant accounts,” Clark said. The battle of agent builders It’s no surprise that model providers create platforms to build agents and bring them to production. The competition lies in how fast new tools and features are added.Google’s Agent Builder competes with OpenAI’s open-source Agent Development Kit, which enables developers to create AI agents using non-OpenAI models. Additionally, there is the recently announced AgentKit, which features an Agent Builder that enables companies to integrate agents into their applications easily. Microsoft has its Azure AI Foundry, launched last year around this time for AI agent creation, and AWS also offers agent builders on its Bedrock platform, but Google is hoping is suite of new features will help give it a competitive edge. However, it isn’t just companies with their own models that court developers to build their AI agents within their platforms. Any enterprise service provider with an agent library also wants clients to make agents on their systems. Capturing developer interest and keeping them within the ecosystem is the big battle between tech companies now, with features to make building and governing agents easier.",

          "standfirst": "Integrating AI models directly into extended detection and response (XDR) platforms is delivering breakthrough improvements in SOC investigation speed and accuracy.In an exclusive interview with VentureBeat, eSentire revealed that deploying Anthropic&#x27;s Claude across their Atlas XDR Platform compresses comprehensive threat investigations from five hours to seven minutes, delivering a 43x speed improvement, while matching senior SOC analyst decision-making with 95% accuracy.The typical enterprise SOC handles roughly 10,000 alerts daily, according to Dropzone AI&#x27;s research. SOC analysts tell VentureBeat that, on average, they can investigate just 22% to 25% of all alerts. Depending on how the SOC was configured and whether there&#x27;s too much reliance on legacy, non-integrated systems, false positives can reach 80%. The result: Critical threats go uninvestigated while analysts spend entire shifts on manual evidence-gathering workflows.\"We&#x27;re not looking to remove work but deliver better outcomes,\" Dustin Hillard, chief product and technology officer at eSentire, told VentureBeat. \"It really means understanding a threat better for our customers. When we say five hours of work in a few minutes, that&#x27;s 30 different evidence-gathering steps dynamically generated in the context of that specific security investigation.\"The breakthrough comes from integrating AI at the platform level. ESentire&#x27;s approach enables Anthropic&#x27;s Claude to orchestrate multi-tool workflows that correlate threat patterns across thousands of data points simultaneously, in essence replicating how senior analysts think but at machine speed.Platform integration represents XDR&#x27;s next evolution as AI adoption acceleratesSecurity copilots initially took aim at operational pains preventing SOC analysts from excelling at their work. They prove extremely useful for accelerating triage, alert de-duplication, noise suppression, firewall tuning and many other tasks. VentureBeat&#x27;s Security Copilot Guide, a comparative matrix of 16 vendors, reveals how copilots are designed to be tailored to the specific strengths of a given SOC&#x27;s analyst team.The next evolution moves beyond standalone copilots as major XDR vendors integrate third-party AI models directly into their platforms. ESentire&#x27;s approach with Anthropic&#x27;s Claude demonstrates how deeply-integrated AI can transform investigation workflows. The company&#x27;s DevOps and engineering teams discovered that platform-integrated AI can deliver comprehensive threat investigations matching senior SOC analyst decision-making with 95% accuracy, while reducing investigation time from five hours to under seven minutes, providing a 43x speed improvement.\"The ideal approach is typically to use AI as a force multiplier for human analysts rather than a replacement,\" Vineet Arora, CTO for WinWire, told VentureBeat. \"For example, AI can handle initial alert triage and routine responses to security issues, allowing analysts to focus their expertise on sophisticated threats and strategic work.\"eSentire&#x27;s Hillard noted: \"Earlier this year, around Claude 3.7, we started seeing the tool selection and the reasoning of conclusions across multiple evidence-gathering steps get to the point where it was matching our experts. That&#x27;s what really got us excited. We were hitting on something that would allow us to deliver better investigation quality for our customers, not just efficiency.\"The company compared Claude&#x27;s autonomous investigations against their most experienced Tier 3 SOC analysts across 1,000 diverse scenarios spanning ransomware, lateral movement, credential compromise and advanced persistent threats, finding that it achieved 95% alignment with expert judgment and 99.3% threat suppression on first contact.Multi-tool orchestration replicates senior analyst reasoning at machine speedeSentire&#x27;s DevOps and R&D teams integrated AI at the baseline of their Atlas XDR platform to deliver greater accuracy, speed and scale in SOC operations. Anthropic&#x27;s Claude handles the orchestration of multi-tool workflows that correlate threat patterns across thousands of data points. The system synthesizes evidence from endpoint telemetry, network traffic, log data, cloud environments, identity systems and vulnerability feeds simultaneously, all of which previously forced analysts into a series of serial investigation steps consuming entire shifts.Hillard explained that the deployment runs on Amazon Bedrock, with LangGraph providing the agentic orchestration framework that enables Anthropic&#x27;s Claude to select tools and reason through multi-step investigations dynamically. Each workflow inherits customer-specific access tokens that cascade through the Atlas Actions platform. By taking this approach, Hillard says every tool call, data query and vendor integration stays secure in tenant isolation.\"Using Bedrock was actually quite simple for us because we&#x27;ve been on AWS basically since the platform started,\" Hillard explained. \"The way Anthropic models are deployed within Bedrock makes everything locked tight in a way that we and our customers got comfortable with. A lot of our customers are critical infrastructure companies with extreme sensitivity around their data.\"When an incident triggers, a typical detection and response system has 15 minutes to contain it before lateral movement threatens broader infrastructure. That time window previously forced rapid-fire triage that precluded deep investigation. Hillard explains that Anthropic&#x27;s Claude is helping to turn that time pressure into an advantage by executing comprehensive evidence gathering across all telemetry sources — querying process trees, conducting log searches across stored telemetry, correlating related incidents from historical ticketing data and cross-referencing active threat intelligence.The Atlas XDR platform&#x27;s investigation process dynamically generates approximately 30 evidence-gathering steps tailored to each specific threat scenario across three dimensions: deeper analysis of security telemetry, context from related past incidents at the customer and threat landscape intelligence about what active threat actors are doing across eSentire&#x27;s entire customer base.Network effects amplify threat intelligence across customer deploymentsESentire&#x27;s Threat Response Unit uses Anthropic&#x27;s Claude to search across log, endpoint, network, cloud and identity data. When the team identifies emergent threat actor behaviors — through open-source intelligence or protecting critical infrastructure customers who see attacks first — they reflect those patterns against their 2,000-plus customers to identify repeated techniques before damage occurs.An attack against one customer strengthens defenses for all customers, as Claude enables the Atlas XDR platform to continually learn from new threats. Hillard told VentureBeat that the platform&#x27;s threat hunting stays ahead of commercial feeds 35% of the time and identifies threats never seen in commercial feeds 12% of the time.\"What used to take our experts a week to accomplish, they can now do in an hour,\" Hillard says. \"When they have a creative idea to test a new data analysis pattern, work that might have taken an engineering team a month to build, they can now do it directly in natural language.\"The velocity shift enables analysts to test hypotheses in hours rather than weeks, amplifying human expertise rather than replacing it. Hillard says the approach is working at scale across customers’ critical infrastructure deployments.Streamlined workflows prevent analyst burnout before it happensThe performance improvements address a growing workforce challenge before it becomes a crisis. SOC analysts tell VentureBeat the industry is decades away from a completely autonomous SOC, with many analysts relying on swivel chair integration (moving from one system to another to resolve alerts). This fragmented approach wastes time, introduces errors and contributes to analyst burnout.More than 70% of SOC analysts say they&#x27;re burned out, with 66% reporting that half their work is repetitive enough to be automated. In anonymous conversations VentureBeat conducts regularly via Signal, SOC analysts confide that a six-month to one-year tenure has become common. One analyst reported a 96% false positive rate in their environment — conditions that make effective threat detection nearly impossible.The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects information security analyst positions will grow 33% from 2023 to 2033, vastly outpacing the 4% average across all occupations. Using AI-based platforms to streamline SOC workflows represents a crucial strategy for enterprises to prevent burnout before it forces their best security talent to leave for less demanding roles.The strategic shift to platform-integrated AIAs enterprises face projected 33% growth in security analyst positions through 2033, platform-integrated AI offers a path to scale SOC operations without proportionally scaling headcount. The shift from five-hour investigations to seven-minute automated workflows doesn&#x27;t eliminate the need for senior analysts; it amplifies their expertise by enabling them to focus on sophisticated threat hunting and strategic work rather than repetitive evidence-gathering tasks.Platform-integrated AI represents a fundamental change in SOC economics. The 43x speed improvement that eSentire achieved demonstrates that AI can replicate elite analyst decision-making with 95% accuracy when integrated adequately at the platform level — not by replacing human expertise, but by automating the workflows that previously consumed entire shifts and left critical threats uninvestigated.The question for enterprise security leaders is how quickly organizations can integrate AI at the platform level to improve SOC performance before the combination of alert overload and manual workflows drives analysts to leave. For critical infrastructure protection, the ability to investigate threats 43 times faster while maintaining 95% accuracy while aligning with senior analysts represents the difference between staying ahead of adversaries and falling behind.",

          "content": "The Event Horizon Telescope only recently gave us the first images of the environment immediately surrounding a black hole. Since then, it has been boosting the resolution and filling in the details of an environment dominated by the most extreme gravity in the Universe. But which gravity are we talking about? Because of its incompatibility with quantum mechanics and our current inability to explain dark matter, people have proposed all sorts of variants of gravity that go beyond general relativity and clean up some of the physics’ awkwardness. It’s possible that the extreme environment near a black hole amplifies the differences among at least some of these hypotheses. So, a group of physicists decided to see whether any of those differences might be large enough that the next generation of telescopes might be able to rule out some potential replacements for relativity. Searching for subtlety Any replacement for general relativity faces an awkward challenge: General relativity does pretty well at explaining everything from the large-scale structure of the Universe to phenomena we can measure right here on Earth. So, any alternative theories would have to differ from relativity in very subtle ways that might be extremely difficult to detect.Read full article Comments",

You can also ask questions about the future, backed by new betting market data sources. The update, which is rolling out over the next several weeks, will add a Deep Research option to the Finance chatbot. The company claims that with the more powerful AI, users will be able to generate “fully cited” research reports on a given topic in just a few minutes. So you can expect an experience similar to Deep Research in the Gemini app—you give it a prompt, and then you come back later to see the result.

Through it all, there has been some progress. In 2016, a Soyuz-2 rocket launched from the first pad, “1S.” And eight years later, a second pad, “1A,” opened with a successful Angara rocket launch.

The Next Generation‘s seven-year run in the late ’80s and early ’90s represents a creative and cultural peak for the franchise, and a 2010s-era remaster that painstakingly re-scanned and upgraded all of the original footage and effects for high-definition TVs has kept the old episodes looking fresher than other ’90s Trek shows like Deep Space Nine and Voyager.Read full article Comments",

Google calls these chips Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs. “Project Suncatcher is a moonshot exploring a new frontier: equipping solar-powered satellite constellations with TPUs and free-space optical links to one day scale machine learning compute in space,” Google wrote in a blog post.Read full article Comments",

One of the samples, for instance, tracked under the name PromptLock, was part of an academic study analyzing how effective the use of large language models can be “to autonomously plan, adapt, and execute the ransomware attack lifecycle.” The researchers, however, reported the malware had “clear limitations: it omits persistence, lateral movement, and advanced evasion tactics” and served as little more than a demonstration of the feasibility of AI for such purposes. Prior to the paper’s release, security firm ESET said it had discovered the sample and hailed it as “the first AI-powered ransomware.” Don’t believe the hype Like the other four samples Google analyzed—FruitShell, PromptFlux, PromptSteal, and QuietVault—PromptLock was easy to detect, even by less-sophisticated endpoint protections that rely on static signatures. All samples also employed previously seen methods in malware samples, making them easy to counteract.

Losses in court left Google to make sweeping changes to the Play Store, but Google appeared poised to take the case all the way to the Supreme Court. That is unlikely now that Epic and Google have reached a settlement in the case. It still needs to be approved by the judge, but the agreement provides a framework for long-term changes to Android app distribution that would apply globally. Late last month, Google was forced to make the first round of mandated changes to the Play Store to comply with the court’s ruling. It grudgingly began allowing developers to direct users to alternative payment options and app downloads outside of Google’s ecosystem. By next summer, Google was supposed to open up Android to third-party app stores in a big way. These changes were only mandated for three years and in the United States. The new agreement includes a different vision for third-party stores on Android—one that Google finds more palatable and that still gives Epic what it wants. If approved, the settlement will lower Google’s standard fee for developers. There will also be new support in Android for third-party app stores that will reduce the friction of leaving the Google bubble. Under the terms of the settlement, Google will support these changes through at least June 2032.Read full article Comments",

Penn became one of just nine schools nationally to be offered a special “compact” with the federal government, which would give the feds broad control over the school and its speech in return for preferential access to federal funds. Penn declined to sign the deal. (Making the whole surreal situation stranger was the fact that one of Penn’s own wealthy boosters apparently helped the Trump administration write the compact.) In other words, Penn has become an obvious target of the Trump administration; now it has been targeted by a hacker claiming to share Trump and Musk’s grievances over affirmative action and “wokeness.”Read full article Comments",

Every atom is the same and should perform similarly every time. And since the qubits themselves can be moved around, it’s theoretically possible to entangle any atom or ion with any other in the system, allowing for a lot of flexibility in how algorithms and error correction are performed. This combination of consistent, high-fidelity performance with all-to-all connectivity has led many key demonstrations of quantum computing to be done on trapped-ion hardware. Unfortunately, the hardware has been held back a bit by relatively low qubit counts—a few dozen compared to the hundred or more seen in other technologies. But on Wednesday, a company called Quantinuum announced a new version of its trapped-ion hardware that significantly boosts the qubit count and uses some interesting technology to manage their operation. Trapped-ion computing Both neutral atom and trapped-ion computers store their qubits in the spin of the nucleus. That spin is somewhat shielded from the environment by the cloud of electrons around the nucleus, giving these qubits a relatively long coherence time. While neutral atoms are held in place by a network of lasers, trapped ions are manipulated via electromagnetic control based on the ion’s charge. This means that key components of the hardware can be built using standard electronic manufacturing, although lasers are still needed for manipulations and readout.Read full article Comments",
