          "standfirst": "Apple's most recent iPad release is the iPad Pro with the new M5 chip (we called it \"perhaps the most impressive piece of hardware Apple sells\" in our review). Despite being only weeks old, it already has a $50 discount on the base configuration, bringing it to $949. As for the other iPads, we're seeing a discount on the standard iPad with the A16 chip that drops it to $299. A handful of other Apple gear is on sale too, and we included those discounts below. There aren't nearly as many hot deals as there were for October Prime day — we're assuming most of the really steep discounts are being held in reserve for Black Friday — but until then, these are the best iPad deals we could find, along with other Apple discounts that are worth your time. Best iPad deals Apple iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch) for $949 ($50 off): Apple's newest iPad came out earlier this month and is already seeing a $50 discount. That makes the model with 256GB of storage and Wi-Fi connectivity $949 instead $999. Both the silver and black colorway are currently discounted. We gave the new iPad Pro an 85 in our review and called it more powerful and capable than ever. It has an amazing screen and the build is stunning. It's powerful enough to do just about anything a laptop can, but it's almost impossibly thin and portable. That said, it's probably overkill for most people, and the cost is almost prohibitively high. This discount makes it a little easier to take. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Apple iPad (A16, 256GB) for $399 ($50 off): This deal isn't an all-time low for the standard iPad model with 256GB of storage but it takes $50 off Apple's list price. Also at Best Buy. Apple iPad Air (11-inch, M3, 1TB) for $949 ($150 off MSRP): The most recent iPad Air is a relatively minor update, as the only major addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still recommend the Air over the base model in our iPad buying guide: Its display is laminated, more color-rich and better at fending off glare (though it's still 60Hz); its speakers are more robust; it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead. This deal is only for the maxed-out model with 1TB of storage, but it ties the lowest price we've seen all the same. Best Apple deals Apple Mac mini (M4) for $499 ($100 off): The newest version of Apple’s tiny desktop PC has a smaller overall footprint, a faster M4 chip, 16GB of RAM as standard (finally), two front-facing USB-C ports, an extra Thunderbolt 4 port and the ability to drive three external displays. It doesn't have any USB-A ports, however. We gave the M4 Pro model a review score of 90. This deal is for the entry-level version with a base M4 chip, 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD — we’ve seen it fall as low as $469 in the past, but this is still a decent savings. Also at Walmart. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The top-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a fine discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Walmart. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4, 512GB) for $999 ($200 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This discount ties the all-time low for the model with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS, 42mm) for $389 ($10 off): The latest flagship Apple Watch only hit store shelves last month, but Amazon is already selling it for $10 off. It doesn't show up as a percentage off, but you'll see some models listed at $389 instead of Apple's $399 MSRP. If you're new to Apple's wearables or are ready to upgrade from a Series 9 or older, this is a good model to grab. If you're coming from a Series 10, however, there's not much need to upgrade as the only major change from last year's model is a slightly larger battery and a tougher screen. Apple Watch SE 3 (GPS, 40mm) for $240 ($9 off): There's a similar stealth discount for the newest budget model, the Apple Watch SE 3, at Amazon. It normally goes for $249 — again, not a big discount, but better than nothing if you're looking to get onboard early. Apple gave this model some badly needed updates compared to its predecessor, including an always-on display, faster charging, better sensors and the same processor that you'll find in the new Apple Watch Series 11.

          "title": "How an Oregon court became the stage for a $115,000 showdown between Meta and Facebook creators",
          "standfirst": "Some of the most successful creators on Facebook aren't names you'd ever recognize. In fact, many of their pages don't have a face or recognizable persona attached. Instead, they run pages dedicated to memes, animal videos and yes, AI-generated photos and videos.The people behind these pages are experts at creating content that can catch Facebook's algorithm and go viral. Successful pages can generate tens of thousands of dollars a month from performance bonuses, revenue-sharing and other monetization programs that pay Facebook creators for popular content.For years, Meta fostered this industry of viral content on Facebook. As the company transformed Facebook's main feed into a \"discovery engine\" of recommended posts from random pages and accounts, creators supplied a stream of content crafted for the algorithm. But over the last year, some creators say this dynamic has broken down. Meta has penalized creators for the very same content it once rewarded. Other creators have seen Facebook's payment systems break down due to glitches and other errors.One creator has become so frustrated, he's filed dozens of lawsuits in small claims court against Meta over the last year. Some of those lawsuits are related to missing payments and account issues he's experienced, but he's also brought 23 cases related to other creators' Facebook pages. As several of those cases are now winding their way through small claims court, he hopes his actions will bring attention to what he says is a wider breakdown in Meta's relationship with Facebook creators.The cases shine a light on how Meta's lack of human-centered customer service can impact creators who rely on the platform. But it also offers a glimpse into the volatile dynamics of viral Facebook content. Mel Bouzad is a former photojournalist for Getty Images who for the past eight years has made his living running popular Facebook pages with names like \"The Meme Bros\" and \"FunkiestShitEver.\" He posts memes, travel content and AI-generated videos. Over the years, he's become an expert at figuring out what type of content is most likely to rack up views and comments on Facebook. \"It's basically jumping on the trends as they're happening,\" he explains. \"If you can jump on the trending topics right at the beginning, then you get the momentum, it kicks in the algorithm, and it sends your content viral. And if one post goes viral, the algorithm is going to send the next post viral, because it thinks the next post is going to get the same type of engagement.\" He's also learned little tricks for drawing more Facebook comments: adding a small error in a travel-focused listicle, or asking questions like \"what's the most boring state in America?\"Example of recent posts from one of Bouzad's travel-themed pages on Facebook.He estimates that at their peak, his pages collectively earned between $10,000 to $20,000 a month — primarily from performance bonuses and in-stream video ads — though they sometimes earned much more than that. Last September, 12 of his pages earned more than $68,0000 combined in performance bonuses, according to documents viewed by Engadget. But last year, five of his meme and travel pages were suddenly demonetized. The pages received a \"monetization policy violation,\" a vague, catch-all term that can describe many supposed infractions. After some digging, he discovered they had been flagged for allegedly operating in a country ineligible for Meta's monetization programs. \"To monetize, you must reside in an eligible country where the product or feature is available,\" a notice in the Facebook app said. \"You may lose your ability to monetize if you move to an ineligible location or if Facebook changes product eligibility.\" Bouzad, who lives in the United States, assumed it was a misunderstanding and would be an easy fix.But, like so many others, he quickly found that getting help from Meta was far from straightforward. \"Despite 20+ support tickets and using paid support, I receive only automated replies,\" he later wrote in his first filing in small claims court last November. Bouzad had heard of people using small claims court to get Meta's attention and decided to try it for himself. \"I thought, I'm going to go in and sue for only one page … something small, just to get in the door [and] speak to somebody.\" At that point, Meta was withholding $2,498 in payments from the page called \"Man Cave USA,\" according to court documents. He requested Meta pay the outstanding balance, along with $409 to cover court fees and interest. His filing succeeded in getting a response from Meta. Bouzad said that about three weeks later he received a call from a law firm representing the social media company. After an extended back and forth, Meta eventually restored the page's ability to earn money. By February he officially dropped the case, telling the court that the company had \"corrected the issue and remitted the payments owed.\" Meta's conflicting explanationsWhile he was dealing with that case, he tried to resolve the issues related to his other pages. Since he was still in mediation with Meta for his \"Man Cave USA\" page, he asked Meta's representatives if they could help with his other pages. He says that during a mediation session over Zoom, Meta's legal reps told him they wouldn't help with other pages unless they were tied to a lawsuit. So in February he opened six new small claims court cases against the company. At the time, he said, Meta owed him more than $40,000 in unpaid invoices from accounts that had been wrongfully flagged; $15,000 of which were earnings from a single Facebook page. Because small claims court limits damages to $10,000 per case, he could only sue for a combined $35,000, but hoped that Meta would reinstate the payments if it were to re-examine his accounts.In the meantime, Bouzad continued to try to resolve his account issues through Meta's official support channels and received confusing, and sometimes downright conflicting, information. In one email, Meta support told him he had been flagged for \"limited originality of content,\" but didn't explain. He also, again, received notifications saying that he was in a country that was \"ineligible\" for Meta's monetization programs. In two separate chats with Meta Verified, the social network's paid subscription service for customer support, he was informed that he was ineligible because his page was linked to a bank account in Malta. The representatives then closed the chats without giving him an opportunity to respond, according to screenshots viewed by Engadget. Bouzad was getting more and more frustrated. \"One, I've never been to Malta, two, my bank is Wells Fargo and three, I live in Oregon,\" he says. A chat with Meta Verified support in which Bouzad was told his accounts were demonetized because his bank was based in Malta. Bouzad says he's only ever banked with Wells Fargo.He now sees his issues as part of a wider pattern from Meta. While the company had once provided him with a partner manager — a Facebook employee who could help sort out issues and provide advice — he hasn't had a dedicated contact at the company since 2020. To him, the problem is twofold: Meta has become overly reliant on artificial intelligence for content moderation, which results in too many errors. At the same time, he claims Meta has largely outsourced the customer service it does offer — like through Meta Verified — and these workers aren't able to handle the types of issues he and other creators increasingly encounter. Some creators who Bouzad has named in his lawsuits claim to have missed out on tens of thousands of dollars in payments for what they describe as glitches in Meta's processes. Brent, a creator who asked to be identified by his first name only, was running a successful Facebook page that posts history-themed AI-generated videos. One recent clip features a group of supposed German prisoners-of-war walking through the snow, accompanied by a caption claiming that some POWs chose to immigrate to Canada following the war after experiencing \"humane treatment\" from their captors. The page was doing well for a few months until April, when Meta asked Brent to verify his identity in order to keep receiving payments. His account had more than $11,000 in unpaid earnings at the time, according to documents reviewed by Engadget. Several months later, Brent has been unable to complete this seemingly mundane step, despite repeatedly providing Meta a copy of his ID. Brent says that the issue stems from Meta mistakenly classifying his payout account as a \"private corporation\" rather than a \"personal account.\" He says he has spent thousands of dollars on Meta Verified (the highest tier costs $500 a month) and has opened numerous support cases but has not been able to get the issue resolved.Another creator is stuck after encountering a similar issue that prevented him from confirming the tax information associated with his payout account on Facebook. \"My payout earnings were locked due to non editable 'greyed out' details when it came to entering tax information and other fields,\" the creator explained. \"After about a year of trying to get support Meta finally came back with an archaic form to transfer the payout account to a new one associated with my page.\" But, after filling out the form for the transfer, Meta informed him that the more than $16,000 in unpaid earnings from his page were unable to be transferred to a new account. The creator, who asked to remain anonymous, has spent more than a decade running music-related pages championing independent artists on the platform. \"We're collectively sick of how Meta treats everyone, failing to provide adequate support, reasoning, reports and outcomes for content creators,\" he told Engadget. \"There's little to no consistency or confidence in their ability to fairly reward creators.\" He's also battling stage 4 cancer, and says the missing funds have interfered with his treatment, and added to the stress he's already facing. His doctors recently informed him he likely has only a few months left to live; he's still hoping to recover the missing funds. Gaps in supportSocial media is filled with numerous complaints about the ineffectiveness of Facebook's support tools, including Meta Verified. Daniel Abas, the president and founder of the Creators Guild of America, a nonprofit organization that advocates for creators, says that demonetization is a \"chronic issue\" affecting creators on many platforms, including Meta's. \"What's really difficult is not having consistency in terms of the enforcement and having policies that are opaque, having appeals processes that are inconsistent,\" he said.Abas says that creators, especially high-earning ones, should have more resources to get support from companies like Meta. \"Working with a web chat to get something resolved, or submitting an email to get something resolved, and not having that human touch is a major gap, and contributes to a lot of stress and a lot of uncertainty when you're trying to build a company.\"Meta has seemingly been changing some of the standards it has for creators on Facebook over the last year. The company in recent months began to crack down on creators sharing spammy and \"low quality\" content, though it only described a few specific examples of such activity, like pages that share posts with \"long, distracting captions.\" The company does not prohibit creators from monetizing AI-generated content. In fact, Mark Zuckerberg recently said that Meta plans to add a \"huge corpus\" of AI content to its systems. Meta declined to provide a comment for this story. The company maintains Bouzad has violated its policies, and has argued his court cases involving other Facebook users should be dismissed. Bouzad insists that he has never intentionally violated Facebook's rules, and has grown frustrated with the company's changing explanations for why his pages have been demonetized. In an email with Meta Verified support, a customer service rep told him a recent violation for one of his travel pages was due to \"Limited Originality of Contents,\" but didn't point to a specific post. During mediation, though, Meta's legal team claimed the same page had been generating views via \"inauthentic engagement,\" according to documents reviewed by Engadget. Bouzad pushed back. \"This wasn’t manipulation — it was performance-based exposure … we’re being punished for the very behavior the system rewarded,\" he wrote in an email to Meta's legal team. Bouzad says that Facebook consistently rewarded his posts with higher reach before it accused him of manipulating views.In documents reviewed by Engadget, Meta doesn't explain its allegation of inauthentic engagement. But the company did tell Bouzad it would be willing to pay him $5,000 — a fraction of what he claims to be owed — to settle the cases even though it was standing by its decision to demonetize his pages. Bouzad declined. He believes that Meta is unfairly targeting him and other creators who run high-earning Facebook pages. Bouzad says he's heard countless stories from other creators who have also been hit with vague \"monetization page violations\" that have stalled their payments. Much like he experienced, these account flags don't describe the supposed infraction and don't give an opportunity for an appeal. This, he says, leaves creators with few options outside of the legal system.An unusual legal maneuver After filing his second batch of small claims court cases in February, he began to reach out to his network and started filing more cases. Bouzad is not a lawyer and has no legal training; he's relied on ChatGPT and Gemini to guide his legal strategy. Much of that strategy relies on showing that other creators have allowed him to sue on their behalf through a process known as an assignment of claims. He filed 25 such cases in 2025. Becoming a legal assignee is at best an unusual move for small claims court. Multiple legal experts contacted by Engadget said they had never heard of anyone doing so. \"Normally, I don't think you see assigned claims in small claims [court],\" Richard Slottee, a retired Oregon-based attorney, who has previously advised clients on small claims court cases. He said he was unsure of the legality of the move. Marion County Circuit Court Judge Lindsay Partridge, who is presiding over Bouzad's small claims court case, seems similarly perplexed by the issue. In an October 23 hearing, he said that \"there are some type of claims that under Oregon law, an anti-assignment clause would not be enforceable\" but that he was unsure if the statute would apply in this particular case. \"I tried to do a bunch of research on this,\" he said \"I just can't find an answer to it.\"Meta, on the other hand, has argued that its terms of service clearly prohibit users from transferring their rights to other parties without its consent. \"Based on the No Transfer Clause, this Court should not permit Mr. Bouzad to continue recruiting Facebook users from all over the world and flooding its docket with cases where he claims standing based on an invalid assignment,\" a Meta project manager wrote in a letter to the judge. During the hearing, Judge Partridge said he was \"concerned\" that \"what I have is essentially a very technical legal issue that's being presented by two non-attorneys.\" He said he would need \"a little bit more time\" to make a decision on whether Bouzad could move forward as an assignee.The group Bouzad is helping consists mainly of colleagues, friends and friends-of-friends who had heard about his small claims cases. And though a few of the individuals are people he's partnered with in the past, he says he has no financial stake in the success of their pages. \"It's power in numbers, we felt the more people, the more noise we could make, the better the chances of getting issues resolved,\" Bouzad says. \"They gave me their cases to try and get that help [to] force Facebook to fix their pages.\" But there's also a potentially lucrative payday for him if he succeeds. As an assignee, he has the sole right to collect any judgment that ultimately comes out of the other creator's claims. This Court should not permit Mr. Bouzad to continue recruiting Facebook users from all over the world and flooding its docket with cases where he claims standing based on an invalid assignment.A Meta project manager who is representing the company in small claims courtFor some of the creators involved, the amount at stake is far higher than what Bouzad has claimed in his flings. One UK-based creator who has assigned their claim to Bouzad runs a dog-themed Facebook page that generated more than $60,000 from in-stream video ads during a one-month period last year, according to documents seen by Engadget. Like Bouzad, their page was hit with an unexplained \"MPV\" violation that has affected their reach. \"Due to its original content and niche audience, the Facebook algorithm regularly rewards it with high reach and frequent placement in the recommendation feed,\" Bouzad wrote in a small claims court filing that claimed $1,000 in damages. \"This natural visibility has now been unfairly disabled by Meta.\" Another creator, who asked not to be identified out of fear of retaliation from Meta, asked him to look into three of his Facebook pages, which collectively have more than 1.5 million followers. All three had been demonetized by Meta and, like Bouzad, the creator received conflicting explanations about why. He was told two of the pages were flagged for \"limited originality\" even though he told Engadget he only posts videos that are scripted and filmed by him and his business partners. His pages are dedicated to scripted sketches filmed to look like real-life encounters. They often show people in seemingly mundane situations becoming inexplicably angry, with descriptions like \"Teacher Karen Demands to Know Why I’m Picking Up My Kid,\" or \"I Gave Candy to Kids and Apparently That’s 'Wrong' Now.\"The third page was hit with a \"monetization page violation\" for residing in an \"ineligible country,\" despite the fact that, according to the creator, it was managed from the United States and the EU, both of which are eligible to participate in Meta's programs. Engadget has also verified the page manager locations using Facebook's page transparency information.Bouzad filed two small claims court cases related to these three pages. The two that had been flagged for limited originality eventually had their monetization restored and the case was dismissed. \"I think Mel's helping immensely,\" he told Engadget. \"The fact that he got us the two pages back helped us as a business a lot.\" The second case, related to the page with the \"MPV\" flag, is still pending. The creator, who has worked with Bouzad in the past, says he's grateful for the legal help, but increasingly frustrated with Meta. The demonetized page was his highest-earning page, making between $3,000 - $5,000 a month from video ads on Facebook, according to documents filed as part of the small claims lawsuit. He doesn't understand why Meta continues to penalize it when the page posts similar content as his other accounts. \"We've always been following the rules, because this is our business, it's how we pay the bills,\" he says. But, he says that Facebook's continued errors has made it \"extremely difficult\" to maintain a business as a creator. What's next Of the 32 cases Bouzad has filed, eight were resolved after Meta addressed the underlying issue. Nine cases were dismissed by Bouzad as the creators chose to pursue legal action in other states. Fifteen cases, including six related to Bouzad's own pages, are still open. In July, a judge consolidated Bouzad's remaining cases into a single claim, despite a motion from Bouzad to keep the cases separate. \"The cases affected by this order involve identical parties, raise substantially similar claims, and collectively seek damages that exceed the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court,\" a judge wrote. Bouzad is currently seeking more than $115,0000 in damages, $35,000 of which are from his own pages, over unpaid invoices, filing fees and other expenses related to his months-long battle over Facebook's monetization practices. According to Bouzad, the actual amount owed to him and the other creators is far higher. \"Actual unpaid earnings exceed $220,000,\" he wrote in a filing, \"but amounts have been capped in accordance with small claims jurisdictional limits.\" For now, Bouzad's claims can't move forward until the judge rules on whether Bouzad can proceed as an assignee. If the judge decides in his favor, he will be able to make his arguments to the circuit court judge overseeing the case. If the judge rules in Meta's favor, he will only be able to move forward with the claims pertaining to his own Facebook pages. Bouzad says he is prepared for the fight. He has painstakingly compiled more than 1,000 pages of court documents, screenshots and news clippings for his case. In his filing, he alleges Meta is in breach of contract over the missing payments. He says Meta has consistently flagged creators' accounts with vague \"MPV\" violations, made enforcement errors, delayed payments and ignored appeals. He acknowledges that his months-long legal battle, and his reduced earnings, have taken a toll on his personal life. \"Taking on Facebook, it's not like you're suing a mom and pop shop,\" he says. \"You're suing one of the largest businesses in the world, and it has caused a lot of stress.\"His goal is still to get the monetization restrictions lifted from the Facebook pages and for Meta to resume its payments to him and the other creators. \"I just want the pages fixed and the money paid that's owed,\" he said. He has hundreds of travel videos saved and ready to post on his Facebook pages if and when his monetization is restored.Have a tip for Karissa?

          "content": "Some of the most successful creators on Facebook aren't names you'd ever recognize. In fact, many of their pages don't have a face or recognizable persona attached. Instead, they run pages dedicated to memes, animal videos and yes, AI-generated photos and videos.The people behind these pages are experts at creating content that can catch Facebook's algorithm and go viral. Successful pages can generate tens of thousands of dollars a month from performance bonuses, revenue-sharing and other monetization programs that pay Facebook creators for popular content.For years, Meta fostered this industry of viral content on Facebook. As the company transformed Facebook's main feed into a \"discovery engine\" of recommended posts from random pages and accounts, creators supplied a stream of content crafted for the algorithm. But over the last year, some creators say this dynamic has broken down. Meta has penalized creators for the very same content it once rewarded. Other creators have seen Facebook's payment systems break down due to glitches and other errors.One creator has become so frustrated, he's filed dozens of lawsuits in small claims court against Meta over the last year. Some of those lawsuits are related to missing payments and account issues he's experienced, but he's also brought 23 cases related to other creators' Facebook pages. As several of those cases are now winding their way through small claims court, he hopes his actions will bring attention to what he says is a wider breakdown in Meta's relationship with Facebook creators.The cases shine a light on how Meta's lack of human-centered customer service can impact creators who rely on the platform. But it also offers a glimpse into the volatile dynamics of viral Facebook content. Mel Bouzad is a former photojournalist for Getty Images who for the past eight years has made his living running popular Facebook pages with names like \"The Meme Bros\" and \"FunkiestShitEver.\" He posts memes, travel content and AI-generated videos. Over the years, he's become an expert at figuring out what type of content is most likely to rack up views and comments on Facebook. \"It's basically jumping on the trends as they're happening,\" he explains. \"If you can jump on the trending topics right at the beginning, then you get the momentum, it kicks in the algorithm, and it sends your content viral. And if one post goes viral, the algorithm is going to send the next post viral, because it thinks the next post is going to get the same type of engagement.\" He's also learned little tricks for drawing more Facebook comments: adding a small error in a travel-focused listicle, or asking questions like \"what's the most boring state in America?\"Example of recent posts from one of Bouzad's travel-themed pages on Facebook.He estimates that at their peak, his pages collectively earned between $10,000 to $20,000 a month — primarily from performance bonuses and in-stream video ads — though they sometimes earned much more than that. Last September, 12 of his pages earned more than $68,0000 combined in performance bonuses, according to documents viewed by Engadget. But last year, five of his meme and travel pages were suddenly demonetized. The pages received a \"monetization policy violation,\" a vague, catch-all term that can describe many supposed infractions. After some digging, he discovered they had been flagged for allegedly operating in a country ineligible for Meta's monetization programs. \"To monetize, you must reside in an eligible country where the product or feature is available,\" a notice in the Facebook app said. \"You may lose your ability to monetize if you move to an ineligible location or if Facebook changes product eligibility.\" Bouzad, who lives in the United States, assumed it was a misunderstanding and would be an easy fix.But, like so many others, he quickly found that getting help from Meta was far from straightforward. \"Despite 20+ support tickets and using paid support, I receive only automated replies,\" he later wrote in his first filing in small claims court last November. Bouzad had heard of people using small claims court to get Meta's attention and decided to try it for himself. \"I thought, I'm going to go in and sue for only one page … something small, just to get in the door [and] speak to somebody.\" At that point, Meta was withholding $2,498 in payments from the page called \"Man Cave USA,\" according to court documents. He requested Meta pay the outstanding balance, along with $409 to cover court fees and interest. His filing succeeded in getting a response from Meta. Bouzad said that about three weeks later he received a call from a law firm representing the social media company. After an extended back and forth, Meta eventually restored the page's ability to earn money. By February he officially dropped the case, telling the court that the company had \"corrected the issue and remitted the payments owed.\" Meta's conflicting explanationsWhile he was dealing with that case, he tried to resolve the issues related to his other pages. Since he was still in mediation with Meta for his \"Man Cave USA\" page, he asked Meta's representatives if they could help with his other pages. He says that during a mediation session over Zoom, Meta's legal reps told him they wouldn't help with other pages unless they were tied to a lawsuit. So in February he opened six new small claims court cases against the company. At the time, he said, Meta owed him more than $40,000 in unpaid invoices from accounts that had been wrongfully flagged; $15,000 of which were earnings from a single Facebook page. Because small claims court limits damages to $10,000 per case, he could only sue for a combined $35,000, but hoped that Meta would reinstate the payments if it were to re-examine his accounts.In the meantime, Bouzad continued to try to resolve his account issues through Meta's official support channels and received confusing, and sometimes downright conflicting, information. In one email, Meta support told him he had been flagged for \"limited originality of content,\" but didn't explain. He also, again, received notifications saying that he was in a country that was \"ineligible\" for Meta's monetization programs. In two separate chats with Meta Verified, the social network's paid subscription service for customer support, he was informed that he was ineligible because his page was linked to a bank account in Malta. The representatives then closed the chats without giving him an opportunity to respond, according to screenshots viewed by Engadget. Bouzad was getting more and more frustrated. \"One, I've never been to Malta, two, my bank is Wells Fargo and three, I live in Oregon,\" he says. A chat with Meta Verified support in which Bouzad was told his accounts were demonetized because his bank was based in Malta. Bouzad says he's only ever banked with Wells Fargo.He now sees his issues as part of a wider pattern from Meta. While the company had once provided him with a partner manager — a Facebook employee who could help sort out issues and provide advice — he hasn't had a dedicated contact at the company since 2020. To him, the problem is twofold: Meta has become overly reliant on artificial intelligence for content moderation, which results in too many errors. At the same time, he claims Meta has largely outsourced the customer service it does offer — like through Meta Verified — and these workers aren't able to handle the types of issues he and other creators increasingly encounter. Some creators who Bouzad has named in his lawsuits claim to have missed out on tens of thousands of dollars in payments for what they describe as glitches in Meta's processes. Brent, a creator who asked to be identified by his first name only, was running a successful Facebook page that posts history-themed AI-generated videos. One recent clip features a group of supposed German prisoners-of-war walking through the snow, accompanied by a caption claiming that some POWs chose to immigrate to Canada following the war after experiencing \"humane treatment\" from their captors. The page was doing well for a few months until April, when Meta asked Brent to verify his identity in order to keep receiving payments. His account had more than $11,000 in unpaid earnings at the time, according to documents reviewed by Engadget. Several months later, Brent has been unable to complete this seemingly mundane step, despite repeatedly providing Meta a copy of his ID. Brent says that the issue stems from Meta mistakenly classifying his payout account as a \"private corporation\" rather than a \"personal account.\" He says he has spent thousands of dollars on Meta Verified (the highest tier costs $500 a month) and has opened numerous support cases but has not been able to get the issue resolved.Another creator is stuck after encountering a similar issue that prevented him from confirming the tax information associated with his payout account on Facebook. \"My payout earnings were locked due to non editable 'greyed out' details when it came to entering tax information and other fields,\" the creator explained. \"After about a year of trying to get support Meta finally came back with an archaic form to transfer the payout account to a new one associated with my page.\" But, after filling out the form for the transfer, Meta informed him that the more than $16,000 in unpaid earnings from his page were unable to be transferred to a new account. The creator, who asked to remain anonymous, has spent more than a decade running music-related pages championing independent artists on the platform. \"We're collectively sick of how Meta treats everyone, failing to provide adequate support, reasoning, reports and outcomes for content creators,\" he told Engadget. \"There's little to no consistency or confidence in their ability to fairly reward creators.\" He's also battling stage 4 cancer, and says the missing funds have interfered with his treatment, and added to the stress he's already facing. His doctors recently informed him he likely has only a few months left to live; he's still hoping to recover the missing funds. Gaps in supportSocial media is filled with numerous complaints about the ineffectiveness of Facebook's support tools, including Meta Verified. Daniel Abas, the president and founder of the Creators Guild of America, a nonprofit organization that advocates for creators, says that demonetization is a \"chronic issue\" affecting creators on many platforms, including Meta's. \"What's really difficult is not having consistency in terms of the enforcement and having policies that are opaque, having appeals processes that are inconsistent,\" he said.Abas says that creators, especially high-earning ones, should have more resources to get support from companies like Meta. \"Working with a web chat to get something resolved, or submitting an email to get something resolved, and not having that human touch is a major gap, and contributes to a lot of stress and a lot of uncertainty when you're trying to build a company.\"Meta has seemingly been changing some of the standards it has for creators on Facebook over the last year. The company in recent months began to crack down on creators sharing spammy and \"low quality\" content, though it only described a few specific examples of such activity, like pages that share posts with \"long, distracting captions.\" The company does not prohibit creators from monetizing AI-generated content. In fact, Mark Zuckerberg recently said that Meta plans to add a \"huge corpus\" of AI content to its systems. Meta declined to provide a comment for this story. The company maintains Bouzad has violated its policies, and has argued his court cases involving other Facebook users should be dismissed. Bouzad insists that he has never intentionally violated Facebook's rules, and has grown frustrated with the company's changing explanations for why his pages have been demonetized. In an email with Meta Verified support, a customer service rep told him a recent violation for one of his travel pages was due to \"Limited Originality of Contents,\" but didn't point to a specific post. During mediation, though, Meta's legal team claimed the same page had been generating views via \"inauthentic engagement,\" according to documents reviewed by Engadget. Bouzad pushed back. \"This wasn’t manipulation — it was performance-based exposure … we’re being punished for the very behavior the system rewarded,\" he wrote in an email to Meta's legal team. Bouzad says that Facebook consistently rewarded his posts with higher reach before it accused him of manipulating views.In documents reviewed by Engadget, Meta doesn't explain its allegation of inauthentic engagement. But the company did tell Bouzad it would be willing to pay him $5,000 — a fraction of what he claims to be owed — to settle the cases even though it was standing by its decision to demonetize his pages. Bouzad declined. He believes that Meta is unfairly targeting him and other creators who run high-earning Facebook pages. Bouzad says he's heard countless stories from other creators who have also been hit with vague \"monetization page violations\" that have stalled their payments. Much like he experienced, these account flags don't describe the supposed infraction and don't give an opportunity for an appeal. This, he says, leaves creators with few options outside of the legal system.An unusual legal maneuver After filing his second batch of small claims court cases in February, he began to reach out to his network and started filing more cases. Bouzad is not a lawyer and has no legal training; he's relied on ChatGPT and Gemini to guide his legal strategy. Much of that strategy relies on showing that other creators have allowed him to sue on their behalf through a process known as an assignment of claims. He filed 25 such cases in 2025. Becoming a legal assignee is at best an unusual move for small claims court. Multiple legal experts contacted by Engadget said they had never heard of anyone doing so. \"Normally, I don't think you see assigned claims in small claims [court],\" Richard Slottee, a retired Oregon-based attorney, who has previously advised clients on small claims court cases. He said he was unsure of the legality of the move. Marion County Circuit Court Judge Lindsay Partridge, who is presiding over Bouzad's small claims court case, seems similarly perplexed by the issue. In an October 23 hearing, he said that \"there are some type of claims that under Oregon law, an anti-assignment clause would not be enforceable\" but that he was unsure if the statute would apply in this particular case. \"I tried to do a bunch of research on this,\" he said \"I just can't find an answer to it.\"Meta, on the other hand, has argued that its terms of service clearly prohibit users from transferring their rights to other parties without its consent. \"Based on the No Transfer Clause, this Court should not permit Mr. Bouzad to continue recruiting Facebook users from all over the world and flooding its docket with cases where he claims standing based on an invalid assignment,\" a Meta project manager wrote in a letter to the judge. During the hearing, Judge Partridge said he was \"concerned\" that \"what I have is essentially a very technical legal issue that's being presented by two non-attorneys.\" He said he would need \"a little bit more time\" to make a decision on whether Bouzad could move forward as an assignee.The group Bouzad is helping consists mainly of colleagues, friends and friends-of-friends who had heard about his small claims cases. And though a few of the individuals are people he's partnered with in the past, he says he has no financial stake in the success of their pages. \"It's power in numbers, we felt the more people, the more noise we could make, the better the chances of getting issues resolved,\" Bouzad says. \"They gave me their cases to try and get that help [to] force Facebook to fix their pages.\" But there's also a potentially lucrative payday for him if he succeeds. As an assignee, he has the sole right to collect any judgment that ultimately comes out of the other creator's claims. This Court should not permit Mr. Bouzad to continue recruiting Facebook users from all over the world and flooding its docket with cases where he claims standing based on an invalid assignment.A Meta project manager who is representing the company in small claims courtFor some of the creators involved, the amount at stake is far higher than what Bouzad has claimed in his flings. One UK-based creator who has assigned their claim to Bouzad runs a dog-themed Facebook page that generated more than $60,000 from in-stream video ads during a one-month period last year, according to documents seen by Engadget. Like Bouzad, their page was hit with an unexplained \"MPV\" violation that has affected their reach. \"Due to its original content and niche audience, the Facebook algorithm regularly rewards it with high reach and frequent placement in the recommendation feed,\" Bouzad wrote in a small claims court filing that claimed $1,000 in damages. \"This natural visibility has now been unfairly disabled by Meta.\" Another creator, who asked not to be identified out of fear of retaliation from Meta, asked him to look into three of his Facebook pages, which collectively have more than 1.5 million followers. All three had been demonetized by Meta and, like Bouzad, the creator received conflicting explanations about why. He was told two of the pages were flagged for \"limited originality\" even though he told Engadget he only posts videos that are scripted and filmed by him and his business partners. His pages are dedicated to scripted sketches filmed to look like real-life encounters. They often show people in seemingly mundane situations becoming inexplicably angry, with descriptions like \"Teacher Karen Demands to Know Why I’m Picking Up My Kid,\" or \"I Gave Candy to Kids and Apparently That’s 'Wrong' Now.\"The third page was hit with a \"monetization page violation\" for residing in an \"ineligible country,\" despite the fact that, according to the creator, it was managed from the United States and the EU, both of which are eligible to participate in Meta's programs. Engadget has also verified the page manager locations using Facebook's page transparency information.Bouzad filed two small claims court cases related to these three pages. The two that had been flagged for limited originality eventually had their monetization restored and the case was dismissed. \"I think Mel's helping immensely,\" he told Engadget. \"The fact that he got us the two pages back helped us as a business a lot.\" The second case, related to the page with the \"MPV\" flag, is still pending. The creator, who has worked with Bouzad in the past, says he's grateful for the legal help, but increasingly frustrated with Meta. The demonetized page was his highest-earning page, making between $3,000 - $5,000 a month from video ads on Facebook, according to documents filed as part of the small claims lawsuit. He doesn't understand why Meta continues to penalize it when the page posts similar content as his other accounts. \"We've always been following the rules, because this is our business, it's how we pay the bills,\" he says. But, he says that Facebook's continued errors has made it \"extremely difficult\" to maintain a business as a creator. What's next Of the 32 cases Bouzad has filed, eight were resolved after Meta addressed the underlying issue. Nine cases were dismissed by Bouzad as the creators chose to pursue legal action in other states. Fifteen cases, including six related to Bouzad's own pages, are still open. In July, a judge consolidated Bouzad's remaining cases into a single claim, despite a motion from Bouzad to keep the cases separate. \"The cases affected by this order involve identical parties, raise substantially similar claims, and collectively seek damages that exceed the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court,\" a judge wrote. Bouzad is currently seeking more than $115,0000 in damages, $35,000 of which are from his own pages, over unpaid invoices, filing fees and other expenses related to his months-long battle over Facebook's monetization practices. According to Bouzad, the actual amount owed to him and the other creators is far higher. \"Actual unpaid earnings exceed $220,000,\" he wrote in a filing, \"but amounts have been capped in accordance with small claims jurisdictional limits.\" For now, Bouzad's claims can't move forward until the judge rules on whether Bouzad can proceed as an assignee. If the judge decides in his favor, he will be able to make his arguments to the circuit court judge overseeing the case. If the judge rules in Meta's favor, he will only be able to move forward with the claims pertaining to his own Facebook pages. Bouzad says he is prepared for the fight. He has painstakingly compiled more than 1,000 pages of court documents, screenshots and news clippings for his case. In his filing, he alleges Meta is in breach of contract over the missing payments. He says Meta has consistently flagged creators' accounts with vague \"MPV\" violations, made enforcement errors, delayed payments and ignored appeals. He acknowledges that his months-long legal battle, and his reduced earnings, have taken a toll on his personal life. \"Taking on Facebook, it's not like you're suing a mom and pop shop,\" he says. \"You're suing one of the largest businesses in the world, and it has caused a lot of stress.\"His goal is still to get the monetization restrictions lifted from the Facebook pages and for Meta to resume its payments to him and the other creators. \"I just want the pages fixed and the money paid that's owed,\" he said. He has hundreds of travel videos saved and ready to post on his Facebook pages if and when his monetization is restored.Have a tip for Karissa?

Best Buy's early Black Friday sale has the comfy cans for 45 percent off, knocking their price down to $199. That matches their record low from Prime Day. Bose's headphones have top-notch comfort and active noise cancellation (ANC). For the latter, you can choose between \"Quiet\" (full ANC) and \"Aware\" (hear your surroundings) modes. There's also a wind-blocking feature. The headphones' audio, while not quite on par with the $449 Ultra variant (and missing spatial tricks), far surpasses what you'll typically find for $199. The company estimates 24 hours of battery life. It also supports quick charging: Plug in its USB-C cable and get up to 2.5 hours of charge in only 15 minutes. This model doesn't include an option to turn off ANC altogether, which some people may have appreciated. (That would have led to even more battery life, desirable for frequent travelers.) But if you're like me and always listen in ANC or aware modes, this is as solid a pick as you'll find for the sale price. Best Buy's Halloween weekend sale, dubbed \"DoorBOOsters\" (yes, really), is effectively a kickoff to the retailer's Black Friday sale season, with more deal events to follow in November.

There's also a wind-blocking feature. The headphones' audio, while not quite on par with the $449 Ultra variant (and missing spatial tricks), far surpasses what you'll typically find for $199. The company estimates 24 hours of battery life. It also supports quick charging: Plug in its USB-C cable and get up to 2.5 hours of charge in only 15 minutes. This model doesn't include an option to turn off ANC altogether, which some people may have appreciated. (That would have led to even more battery life, desirable for frequent travelers.) But if you're like me and always listen in ANC or aware modes, this is as solid a pick as you'll find for the sale price. Best Buy's Halloween weekend sale, dubbed \"DoorBOOsters\" (yes, really), is effectively a kickoff to the retailer's Black Friday sale season, with more deal events to follow in November. Note that Amazon has already matched the price on the QuietComfort headphones, too.

          "standfirst": "If you're in the market for a budget-friendly home security camera (or even several), the Blink Mini 2 may be worth considering. A two-pack of the cameras is on sale at Amazon as the bundle has dropped from $70 to $28. That's a discount of 60 percent, which is certainly nothing to shake at. This is also a better price than the $35 we saw for the cameras during Prime Day. Amazon recently revealed a newer version of the Blink Mini that records 2K footage, but the 1080p Blink Mini 2 can still get the job done. The Blink Mini 2 is our pick for the best budget security camera. It's easy to set up and it integrates neatly into the Alexa smart home ecosystem. While you need a Blink Subscription for cloud storage ($3 for one camera, $10 for as many as you like), you can pick up a Sync Module 2 or Sync Module XR to store Blink Mini 2 footage locally. A Blink Subscription also enables specialized detection and alerts (e.g. for people and pets) and features like periodic photo captures. The Blink Mini 2 is weather resistant, though you'll need an adapter to use it outdoors. Additionally, you can use the Mini 2 as a plug-in chime that sounds when someone presses a Blink Video Doorbell. A number of other Blink cameras and bundles are on sale at the moment. If you like the idea of the Mini 2 but want to use it outdoors, you can get two cameras with two weather-resistant adapters for only $48. Elsewhere, the latest Blink Video Doorbell is 50 percent off and down to $30 and Blink Outdoor 4 camera systems are 60 percent off, so you can grab one starting at just $32.

Monarch Money is offering 50 percent off annual plans right now when you use the code MONARCHVIP at checkout. With the typical yearly price being $100, this will save you $50. As mentioned before, the discount is only for new users and it can't be combined with other offers. The code only works when you sign up through the web as well. You can't redeem it through the Monarch mobile app. We feel that Monarch has a steeper learning curve than some other budget trackers and that certain aspects of the app are slightly more complex than they probably need to be. But it offers a great deal of customization and granularity, which outweighs our misgivings. On the main dashboard, you'll see your net worth along with your latest transactions, spending versus the previous month, your income so far for the month and details about upcoming bills, your investments and goals you've set. There's also a link to a month-in-review page, which offers an in-depth overview of what's been happening with your money that month. You'll also be able to take a peek at how your net worth has changed over time. Monarch can connect to your bank and track Apple Card, Apple Cash and Savings accounts. It can pull in your transactions and balance history automatically and detect your recurring expenses and income. The app can even keep your car valuation up to date. While it might take a little work to set up Monarch (and you might have to tweak things here and there), it's a detailed budgeting app that can help you keep better track of your income, expenditure and net worth. If you're a former Mint user (RIP), Monarch Money is a great alternative if you haven't yet found a Mint replacement. But it's worth mentioning that our favorite Mint replacement service, Quicken Simplifi, also has a sale going on right now. It's offering 50 percent off when you sign up for an annual subscription, billed at $3 per month with the discount. That comes out to $36 for the first year.

          "title": "The best free VPNs in 2025",
          "standfirst": "A good VPN is worth paying for. Almost every service I'll recommend as one of the best VPNs is either subscription-only or supported by paid plans. Free VPNs do have their place, though, as not everybody can afford yet another subscription in the software-as-a-service hellscape we live in. Since everyone deserves privacy and flexibility online, I wanted to put together a definitive list of the best free VPNs.Now, some will say that free VPNs are, by definition, security risks that are to be avoided by default. That reputation exists because free VPNs often really are a risk. As proliferating age verification laws have created a need for VPNs, some free services have stepped up to answer the call, while others have taken advantage of it to spread malware. Free VPNs are easy for scammers to set up and hard for app stores to catch. I never recommend using one without doing thorough research.To that end, the three providers on this list are exceptions to the risk of free VPNs. While they all have tradeoffs, they're also upfront about what they do and don't do. Each one comes with reliable security, a clean record of handling user data and apps that never force you to upgrade just so they'll work properly. They aren't the only good free VPNs, but they're the top three by far.Editor's note: This list represents our ranking as of October 2025. We intend to revisit the list every three months at a minimum, at which time our picks may be adjusted based on changes in features, testing results and other factors. Best free VPNs for 2025 Other free VPNs we tested The first three no-cost VPNs mentioned here are worthy of recommendation in their own ways, but didn't quite make the cut for our top picks. I've left notes on them here in case one of them turns out to be perfect for you, and because they're on my list for induction into the free VPN pantheon if they improve. None of the above applies to Hotspot Shield, which you should not use. It's on here as a warning. You can find more details in that section below. PrivadoVPN PrivadoVPN is a strong enough contender that I seriously considered adding it to the list as my fourth official recommendation. It's technically unlimited, though once you use 10GB of data, it sharply handicaps your speed for the rest of the month. Free users can choose between 13 server locations on four continents. It even performs well on worldwide latency tests, though download speeds swing pretty heavily. That uncertain speed stat kept Privado out of the winner's circle, as did one other concern: although it has a clear and extensive privacy policy, it's never gone through a third-party audit. Additionally, it's a newer service, having only launched in 2019 — so it's harder to make claims about its business practices. Finally, while hide.me, Windscribe and Proton VPN all retain their excellence on the paid plan, PrivadoVPN isn't as worth paying for. Outside the free plan, it's a decent VPN with no reason to pick it over Proton or ExpressVPN. That said, if it passes an audit — or faces a real-world test of its no-logs policy, like a server seizure — look for Privado to join the big leagues soon. TunnelBear TunnelBear does free VPN service well — it just doesn't do enough. Trust me, I don’t take pleasure in criticizing its adorable, hole-digging bear mascot, which goes a long way toward making the app welcoming to beginners. I like that its free plan offers access to the entire server network, the only VPN that does so. But the hard fact is that 2GB of data per month is not enough to do much of anything. With such a low data limit, TunnelBear's free plan is an enticement to upgrade to its paid service, not a viable VPN solution in its own right. That really is a good bear, though. EventVPN EventVPN, developed by the ExpressVPN team, was launched a month ago and could one day become an outstanding free VPN. However, given its bizarre decision to run ads in the app, I can't endorse it right now. Were EventVPN not associated with ExpressVPN or Kape Technologies, I might defend its decision to show ads by pointing out that all ad tracking data is anonymized — there isn't even a backend in which to store it. That might be a decent way to fund a full-featured free VPN. But EventVPN is openly part of a lucrative VPN portfolio, and has its own paid tier, so there's no excuse for the 30-second video ads. Hotspot Shield: Tested and not recommended Hotspot Shield was once the poster child for free VPNs; today, it's become one of the clearest illustrations of why they're dangerous. You get 500MB of browsing data per day, which is reasonable, on par with Windscribe's best offer. However, not only does the free version cap speeds at 2 Mbps, but it also restricts you to one location, the United States. Worse, it shows you ads. Unlike EventVPN, which at least limits itself to ads from a single service, Hotspot Shield lists no fewer than eight ad coordinators in its privacy policy. One of them is Meta, which you should never, ever trust with any sensitive data. I can't name a better textbook example of \"if the product is free, you're the product.\" What to look for in a free VPN Selecting a VPN is hard enough with all the competition out there, but with a free VPN, the stakes are even higher. Free VPNs are all over the place, and app stores don't vet them effectively. You're left on your own to determine whether a free VPN is mediocre, exploitative or even a straight-up malware vector. My top three recommendations — hide.me, Windscribe and Proton VPN — are clean. If you choose to use another one, here are the red flags to consider. Security: First, make absolutely certain the free VPN isn't a threat to your security. Research it to see if any experts have warned against it, and check to make sure it uses known and approved encryption protocols (OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2 or an equivalent). If you have an antivirus program, download the VPN in sandbox mode so you can scan it while it's quarantined. Privacy: Read the free VPN's privacy policy in detail to see if it claims any liberties with your personal data. As a rule, never use an \"ad-supported\" free VPN, since almost all ad services track users for targeted campaigns. Other free services, like Hola VPN, make money by selling user IP addresses as residential proxies. Be alert for any indication that the VPN will profit off your personal data. Usage requirements: If you've determined a free VPN is safe and secure, your next step is to make sure you'll be able to use it for the tasks you have in mind. Most reputable free VPNs are limited in some way. Match the restrictions to what you need; for example, if you want a free VPN for streaming, pick one without data caps that lets you choose your own server location. Speed: Even if it meets the minimum requirements of safety and privacy, a free VPN still needs to meet the same criteria as any paid service. Mainly, it's got to be fast. With the free VPN active, run speed tests using Ookla in several locations. On average, it shouldn't reduce your unprotected download speed by more than 25 percent. Customer service: Some otherwise full-featured free VPNs skimp on customer service, restricting live help to paid users. Even Proton VPN is guilty of this. If you're a beginner or think you're going to need extra help, make sure to pick a free VPN with a well-written knowledgebase and available tech support. Free VPN FAQs Let's finish up with some of the free VPN questions we get most often. Leave a comment if you'd like me to answer one I haven't gotten to yet. What is a free VPN? A free VPN is a virtual private network that's available to individual users at no cost. They generally take the form of desktop and mobile apps downloaded through websites or app stores. You can use them to filter your internet connection through another server, changing your virtual location and hiding what you do online. Most people use free VPNs to make it appear that they're getting online from somewhere else. This gets around restrictions on internet usage in certain jurisdictions, like China's \"Great Firewall\" or the UK's age verification laws. It can also be used to stream TV shows and events that aren't available in the user's home region. Are free VPNs safe? While free VPNs aren't inherently dangerous, the use case and underlying business model makes them an easy vector for unscrupulous companies to take advantage of vulnerable users. It's easy for a malicious actor to set one up quickly and get it hosted on an app store. Likewise, the people who download free VPNs tend to need them urgently and may not look too closely at what they're putting on their phones or computers. As a rule of thumb, you should approach a free VPN with extreme caution. If it's not on our recommended list above, we'd suggest avoiding it. In general, it's almost always safer to seek out VPNs that support their free versions with paid subscriptions, since they don't need to make money under the table. But any VPN – or other digital service – that's put forward as totally free puts us in mind of the old adage about gambling: If you can't spot the sucker at the table, it's probably you. What is the best free VPN? I've rated hide.me as the best free VPN. Its free service gives you a lot to work with — seven free locations and a data cap that doesn't really apply in practice. It's also just as secure and trustworthy as its paid version, without skimping on anything important. Can you get a free VPN on your phone? Yes — in fact, there are more free VPNs on mobile app stores than almost anywhere else. All three of my top picks (hide.me, Windscribe and Proton VPN) have apps for both iOS and Android, and nearly every other free VPN works on at least one mobile platform.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html?src=rss",

Today’s models are brighter, sharper and more flexible, making them a practical upgrade for movie nights, gaming sessions or backyard screenings. Whether you want a compact projector that fits in a backpack or a full 4K setup for your living room, there’s something to match nearly every space and budget.Modern projectors handle far more than films. Some are tuned for low-latency gaming, others run built-in streaming apps and many can mirror your phone or laptop without extra cables.

Combine that with lighter designs and quieter cooling, and it’s easy to see why a projector can replace or complement a traditional TV.We’ve tested projectors across categories and price ranges to help you find the right one, whether you’re aiming for a portable option to take on the go or a cinematic display that turns any wall into a screen. Table of contents Best projectors for 2025 What to look for in a projector Best projector FAQs Best projectors for 2025 Some projectors are for serious cinephiles, projecting sharp 4K video with HDR brightness and hyper realistic colors to a large screen. Others are bright enough to replace your TV for sports or gaming, and some low-cost portable models can be set up for camping or outdoor fun. That’s why we’ve divided this guide into several categories to help you find the right one. What to look for in a projector For a deep dive on projector technology check my previous explainer, but there are few key things to keep in mind. What will the projector mainly be used for? What type of room will it be used in? And how big of an image do you want? You’ll also see a variety of specifications that may be confusing, so here are a few to consider and what they mean. Brightness and contrast Brightness is measured in ANSI lumens; the brighter the projector, typically the more expensive it will be. 1,500-2,500 lumens is good for darkened rooms, 3,000-4,000 lumens allows you to see with some ambient light and 4,000+ lumens is bright enough to use in direct sunlight. High contrast is important, because projectors are more sensitive to things like ambient light and reflections. DLP vs LCD Digital light processing units (DLPs) used by Optoma, BenQ, LG and others allow bright 4K images. The negative is that they can produce a “rainbow” effect, or red/blue/green artifacts that affect some viewers more than others. LCDs are used mainly by Epson, but also Sony and Sanyo. Those are often brighter, more color accurate and don’t produce rainbow effects, but are also more expensive and susceptible to image degradation over time. Resolution If you want a true 4K projector, beware: only expensive models have native 4K resolution (many movie theaters still use 2K projectors for various reasons). However, most DLP projectors and some LCD models can use pixel-shifting to attain 4K resolution. Elite Starling HDR and color accuracy Projectors can’t produce anywhere close to the amount of light required to qualify as true HDR. Rather, they use a technique called tone mapping to fit the entire HDR gamut into a lower brightness range. That said, many projectors can display millions of colors, with some models surpassing the color accuracy of TVs and monitors. UST vs. classic Classic projectors and screens can be mounted on the ceiling so they’re great if you have no floor space. They can also project a larger video for a truly cinematic experience. UST projectors mount on the floor right next to the screen so they can take the place of a TV. They don’t beam as big an image but are generally brighter, sharper and more expensive. For best results, they require special screens. Mounting and fan noise Ceiling mounting requires some work and don’t forget to budget for a bracket and any necessary long cables, including extra power for a Google Chromecast or other streaming device. UST projectors require less labor, but getting the image perfectly square can still be surprisingly time-consuming. As for fan noise, some projectors (usually cheaper DLP models) generate more than others. Optics For more flexibility with location and image size, ceiling mounted projectors need a good zoom range. Lens shift, meanwhile, is used if the projector is mounted higher or lower relative to the screen than recommended by the manufacturer. Otherwise, you might have to use a \"keystone correction\" to digitally stretch part of the image, resulting in distortion or artifacts. Also, keystore correction may not work in gaming modes for some models. Gaming and streaming If you’re interested in a projector for gaming, look up the refresh rate and input lag figures. Some projectors offer good numbers in that regard (240Hz and <20 ms, respectively), but others designed for home entertainment have very poor input lag and refresh rates at just 60 Hz. If it’s streaming you want, be sure to pick a model either with built-in Google TV or a bundled streaming dongle. Screens Should you project onto a wall, roll-down screen, fixed screen or ambient light rejecting (ALR) screen? The choice depends largely on the room and what kind of projector you have. Roll down screens take up no space as they’re ceiling mounted, fixed screens can be moved easily and ALR models are perfect in rooms with a lot of ambient light. Best projector FAQs Are 4K projectors better? Yes, because higher resolution is more noticeable on larger screens, so 4K is particularly useful with projectors since they beam images up to 200 inches in size. That being said, brightness and contrast are more important. Is a projector better than a TV? Projectors can provide a more immersive experience thanks to the large screen, but they’re not necessarily “better.” Since you usually have to dim the lights with a projector, TVs are superior for everyday use. Is 2000 lumens bright enough for a projector? Yes, 2000 lumens is easily bright enough, even with some ambient light in the room. However, the image will still be hard to see with the windows open on a bright day. Should I get a 4K or 1080p projector? That depends on your budget and needs. If your budget is below $1,000, look for a 1080p projector with the best brightness and contrast. Between $1,000-$2,000, you’ll need to weigh whether brightness or 4K resolution is most important. Above that, choose the brightest 4K projector you can afford. What are the best projectors in daylight? The best projectors in daylight are ultra short throw (UST) models, as they have the brightest and sharpest image. However, they generally cost more than $2,000. Do you need a screen for a better projector experience? Technically, you don’t need a screen to use a projector — any light-colored, smooth wall can work in a pinch. But if you want to get the most out of your projector, a screen can make a difference. Projector screens are designed to reflect light evenly and enhance contrast, so colors look more vibrant and the picture appears sharper. With a screen, you’ll notice darker blacks and brighter colors, which can give a real boost to your movie nights or gaming sessions. So while you can absolutely enjoy a projector without one, a screen can make the experience feel a bit more like your own personal theater. Should I buy a portable or home projector? It depends on how and where you plan to use it. If you want a projector you can easily move around, bring to friends’ houses or set up indoors or outdoors easily, a portable projector is a great choice. They’re usually smaller, lightweight and often have built-in speakers and batteries, making them convenient for on-the-go use. On the other hand, if you’re looking for a more permanent setup for a home theater or living room, a home projector might be the way to go. Home projectors tend to be more powerful, with higher resolution and brightness, which gives you that crisp, cinema-quality experience. They’re ideal if you have a dedicated space and don’t mind leaving it set up in one spot.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/best-projectors-123004354.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Inside Celosphere 2025: Why there’s no ‘enterprise AI’ without process intelligence",
          "standfirst": "Presented by CelonisAI adoption is accelerating, but results often lag expectations. And enterprise leaders are under pressure to prove measurable ROI from the AI solutions — especially as the use of autonomous agents rises and global tariffs disrupt supply chains.The issue isn’t the AI itself, says Alex Rinke, co-founder and co-CEO of Celonis, a global leader in process intelligence. “To succeed, enterprise AI needs to understand the context of a business’s processes — and how to improve them,” he explains. Without this business context, AI risks becoming, as Rinke puts it, “just an internal social experiment.”Next week’s Celosphere 2025 will tackle the AI ROI challenge head-on. The three-day event brings together customer strategies, hands-on workshops, and live demonstrations, highlighting enhancements to the Celonis Process Intelligence (PI) Platform that help enterprises harness ‘enterprise AI,’ powered by PI, to continuously improve operations, creating measurable business value at scale.Focus on measurable ROIThe event’s focus on achieving AI ROI reflects three challenges facing technology and business leaders moving from pilot to production: obsolete systems, break-neck industry change, and agentic AI. According to Gartner, 64% of board members now view AI as a top-three priority — yet only 10% of organizations report meaningful financial returns.Celonis customers are bucking that trend. A Forrester Total Economic Impact study found organizations using its platform achieved 383% ROI over three years, with payback in just six months. One company improved sales order automation from 33% to 86%, saving $24.5 million. The study estimated $44.1 million in total benefits over three years, driven by faster automation, reduced inefficiencies, and higher process visibility. These numbers underscore a broader pattern — companies that modernize outdated systems and align AI with process optimization see faster payback and sustained gains.Real companies, real resultsCelosphere will spotlight how global enterprises are building “future-fit” operations. Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Vinmar Group will showcase AI-driven, composable solutions, powered by PI, and attendees will see demonstrations of PI enabling agents in live production environments.Among the notable success stories: AstraZeneca, the pharmaceutical company, reduced excess inventory while keeping critical medicines flowing by using Celonis as a foundation for its OpenAI partnership.The State of Oklahoma can answer procurement status questions at scale, unlocking over $10 million in value. Cosentino clears blocked sales orders up to 5x faster using an AI-powered credit management assistant. Raising the stakes for agentic AINumerous sessions will focus on orchestrating AI agents. The shift from AI-as-advisor to AI-as-actor, changes everything, says Rinke. “The agent needs to understand not just what to do, but how your specific business actually works,” he explains. “Process intelligence provides those rails.\" This leap from recommendation to autonomous action raises the stakes exponentially. When agents can independently trigger purchase orders, reroute shipments, or approve exceptions, bad context can mean catastrophically bad outcomes at scale.Celosphere attendees will get to see first-hand how companies are using the Celonis Orchestration Engine to coordinate AI agents alongside people and systems. Effective orchestration is a crucial protection against the chaos of agents working at cross-purposes, duplicating actions, or letting crucial steps fall through the cracks. Navigating tariffs and supply chain shocksGlobal trade volatility isn&#x27;t just a headline — it&#x27;s an operational nightmare reshaping how companies deploy AI, Rinke says. New tariffs trigger cascading effects across procurement, logistics, and compliance. Each policy shift can cascade across thousands of SKUs — forcing new supplier contracts, rerouted shipments, and rebalanced inventories. For AI systems trained on static conditions, that volatility is almost impossible to predict. Traditional AI systems struggle with such variability — but process intelligence gives organizations real-time visibility into how changes ripple through operations.Celosphere case studies will show how companies turn disruption into advantage. Smurfit Westrock uses PI to optimize inventory and reduce costs amid tariff uncertainty, while ASOS leverages PI to optimize its supply chain operations, enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and continuing to deliver an outstanding customer experience.Platform over point solutionsRinke argues that Celonis’ edge lies in treating process intelligence not as an add-on, but as the foundation of the enterprise stack. Unlike bolt-on optimization tools, the Celonis platform creates a living digital twin of business operations — a continuously updated model enriched by context that lets AI operate effectively from analysis to execution.“What sets Celonis apart is visibility across systems and offline tasks, which is critical for true intelligent automation,” Rinke says. “The platform offers comprehensive capabilities spanning process analysis, design, and orchestration rather than a point solution.”“Free the Process” and the future of AICelonis continues to champion openness through its “Free the Process” movement, promoting fair competition and freeing enterprises from legacy lock-in. By giving organizations full access to their own process data, open APIs, and a growing partner network that includes The Hackett Group, ClearOps, and Lobster, Celonis is building the connective tissue for a new era of interoperable automation.For Rinke, this open foundation is what turns AI from a set of experiments into an enterprise engine. “Process intelligence creates a flywheel,” he says. “Better understanding leads to better optimization, which enables better AI — and that, in turn, drives even greater understanding. There is no AI without PI.\"Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

The shift from AI-as-advisor to AI-as-actor, changes everything, says Rinke. “The agent needs to understand not just what to do, but how your specific business actually works,” he explains. “Process intelligence provides those rails.\" This leap from recommendation to autonomous action raises the stakes exponentially. When agents can independently trigger purchase orders, reroute shipments, or approve exceptions, bad context can mean catastrophically bad outcomes at scale.Celosphere attendees will get to see first-hand how companies are using the Celonis Orchestration Engine to coordinate AI agents alongside people and systems. Effective orchestration is a crucial protection against the chaos of agents working at cross-purposes, duplicating actions, or letting crucial steps fall through the cracks. Navigating tariffs and supply chain shocksGlobal trade volatility isn&#x27;t just a headline — it&#x27;s an operational nightmare reshaping how companies deploy AI, Rinke says. New tariffs trigger cascading effects across procurement, logistics, and compliance. Each policy shift can cascade across thousands of SKUs — forcing new supplier contracts, rerouted shipments, and rebalanced inventories. For AI systems trained on static conditions, that volatility is almost impossible to predict. Traditional AI systems struggle with such variability — but process intelligence gives organizations real-time visibility into how changes ripple through operations.Celosphere case studies will show how companies turn disruption into advantage. Smurfit Westrock uses PI to optimize inventory and reduce costs amid tariff uncertainty, while ASOS leverages PI to optimize its supply chain operations, enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and continuing to deliver an outstanding customer experience.Platform over point solutionsRinke argues that Celonis’ edge lies in treating process intelligence not as an add-on, but as the foundation of the enterprise stack. Unlike bolt-on optimization tools, the Celonis platform creates a living digital twin of business operations — a continuously updated model enriched by context that lets AI operate effectively from analysis to execution.“What sets Celonis apart is visibility across systems and offline tasks, which is critical for true intelligent automation,” Rinke says. “The platform offers comprehensive capabilities spanning process analysis, design, and orchestration rather than a point solution.”“Free the Process” and the future of AICelonis continues to champion openness through its “Free the Process” movement, promoting fair competition and freeing enterprises from legacy lock-in. By giving organizations full access to their own process data, open APIs, and a growing partner network that includes The Hackett Group, ClearOps, and Lobster, Celonis is building the connective tissue for a new era of interoperable automation.For Rinke, this open foundation is what turns AI from a set of experiments into an enterprise engine. “Process intelligence creates a flywheel,” he says. “Better understanding leads to better optimization, which enables better AI — and that, in turn, drives even greater understanding. There is no AI without PI.\"Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

          "standfirst": "OpenAI has introduced Aardvark, a GPT-5-powered autonomous security researcher agent now available in private beta.Designed to emulate how human experts identify and resolve software vulnerabilities, Aardvark offers a multi-stage, LLM-driven approach for continuous, 24/7/365 code analysis, exploit validation, and patch generation!Positioned as a scalable defense tool for modern software development environments, Aardvark is being tested across internal and external codebases. OpenAI reports high recall and real-world effectiveness in identifying known and synthetic vulnerabilities, with early deployments surfacing previously undetected security issues.Aardvark comes on the heels of OpenAI’s release of the gpt-oss-safeguard models yesterday, extending the company’s recent emphasis on agentic and policy-aligned systems. Technical Design and OperationAardvark operates as an agentic system that continuously analyzes source code repositories. Unlike conventional tools that rely on fuzzing or software composition analysis, Aardvark leverages LLM reasoning and tool-use capabilities to interpret code behavior and identify vulnerabilities. It simulates a security researcher’s workflow by reading code, conducting semantic analysis, writing and executing test cases, and using diagnostic tools.Its process follows a structured multi-stage pipeline:Threat Modeling – Aardvark initiates its analysis by ingesting an entire code repository to generate a threat model. This model reflects the inferred security objectives and architectural design of the software.Commit-Level Scanning – As code changes are committed, Aardvark compares diffs against the repository’s threat model to detect potential vulnerabilities. It also performs historical scans when a repository is first connected.Validation Sandbox – Detected vulnerabilities are tested in an isolated environment to confirm exploitability. This reduces false positives and enhances report accuracy.Automated Patching – The system integrates with OpenAI Codex to generate patches. These proposed fixes are then reviewed and submitted via pull requests for developer approval.Aardvark integrates with GitHub, Codex, and common development pipelines to provide continuous, non-intrusive security scanning. All insights are intended to be human-auditable, with clear annotations and reproducibility.Performance and ApplicationAccording to OpenAI, Aardvark has been operational for several months on internal codebases and with select alpha partners. In benchmark testing on “golden” repositories—where known and synthetic vulnerabilities were seeded—Aardvark identified 92% of total issues. OpenAI emphasizes that its accuracy and low false positive rate are key differentiators.The agent has also been deployed on open-source projects. To date, it has discovered multiple critical issues, including ten vulnerabilities that were assigned CVE identifiers. OpenAI states that all findings were responsibly disclosed under its recently updated coordinated disclosure policy, which favors collaboration over rigid timelines.In practice, Aardvark has surfaced complex bugs beyond traditional security flaws, including logic errors, incomplete fixes, and privacy risks. This suggests broader utility beyond security-specific contexts.Integration and RequirementsDuring the private beta, Aardvark is only available to organizations using GitHub Cloud (github.com). OpenAI invites beta testers to sign up here online by filling out a web form. Participation requirements include:Integration with GitHub CloudCommitment to interact with Aardvark and provide qualitative feedbackAgreement to beta-specific terms and privacy policiesOpenAI confirmed that code submitted to Aardvark during the beta will not be used to train its models.The company is also offering pro bono vulnerability scanning for selected non-commercial open-source repositories, citing its intent to contribute to the health of the software supply chain.Strategic ContextThe launch of Aardvark signals OpenAI’s broader movement into agentic AI systems with domain-specific capabilities. While OpenAI is best known for its general-purpose models (e.g., GPT-4 and GPT-5), Aardvark is part of a growing trend of specialized AI agents designed to operate semi-autonomously within real-world environments. In fact, it joins two other active OpenAI agents now:ChatGPT agent, unveiled back in July 2025, which controls a virtual computer and web browser and can create and edit common productivity filesCodex — previously the name of OpenAI&#x27;s open source coding model, which it took and re-used as the name of its new GPT-5 variant-powered AI coding agent unveiled back in May 2025But a security-focused agent makes a lot of sense, especially as demands on security teams grow.In 2024 alone, over 40,000 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) were reported, and OpenAI’s internal data suggests that 1.2% of all code commits introduce bugs. Aardvark’s positioning as a “defender-first” AI aligns with a market need for proactive security tools that integrate tightly with developer workflows rather than operate as post-hoc scanning layers.OpenAI’s coordinated disclosure policy updates further reinforce its commitment to sustainable collaboration with developers and the open-source community, rather than emphasizing adversarial vulnerability reporting.While yesterday&#x27;s release of oss-safeguard uses chain-of-thought reasoning to apply safety policies during inference, Aardvark applies similar LLM reasoning to secure evolving codebases. Together, these tools signal OpenAI’s shift from static tooling toward flexible, continuously adaptive systems — one focused on content moderation, the other on proactive vulnerability detection and automated patching within real-world software development environments.What It Means For Enterprises and the CyberSec Market Going ForwardAardvark represents OpenAI’s entry into automated security research through agentic AI. By combining GPT-5’s language understanding with Codex-driven patching and validation sandboxes, Aardvark offers an integrated solution for modern software teams facing increasing security complexity.While currently in limited beta, the early performance indicators suggest potential for broader adoption. If proven effective at scale, Aardvark could contribute to a shift in how organizations embed security into continuous development environments.For security leaders tasked with managing incident response, threat detection, and day-to-day protections—particularly those operating with limited team capacity—Aardvark may serve as a force multiplier. Its autonomous validation pipeline and human-auditable patch proposals could streamline triage and reduce alert fatigue, enabling smaller security teams to focus on strategic incidents rather than manual scanning and follow-up.AI engineers responsible for integrating models into live products may benefit from Aardvark’s ability to surface bugs that arise from subtle logic flaws or incomplete fixes, particularly in fast-moving development cycles. Because Aardvark monitors commit-level changes and tracks them against threat models, it may help prevent vulnerabilities introduced during rapid iteration, without slowing delivery timelines.For teams orchestrating AI across distributed environments, Aardvark’s sandbox validation and continuous feedback loops could align well with CI/CD-style pipelines for ML systems. Its ability to plug into GitHub workflows positions it as a compatible addition to modern AI operations stacks, especially those aiming to integrate robust security checks into automation pipelines without additional overhead.And for data infrastructure teams maintaining critical pipelines and tooling, Aardvark’s LLM-driven inspection capabilities could offer an added layer of resilience. Vulnerabilities in data orchestration layers often go unnoticed until exploited; Aardvark’s ongoing code review process may surface issues earlier in the development lifecycle, helping data engineers maintain both system integrity and uptime.In practice, Aardvark represents a shift in how security expertise might be operationalized—not just as a defensive perimeter, but as a persistent, context-aware participant in the software lifecycle. Its design suggests a model where defenders are no longer bottlenecked by scale, but augmented by intelligent agents working alongside them.",

          "title": "Oakley Meta Vanguard review: Sporty to a fault",
          "standfirst": "By now, I have a well-established routine when I set up a new pair of Meta smart glasses. I connect my Instagram, WhatsApp and Spotify accounts. I complete the slightly convoluted steps in my Bluetooth settings to make sure Meta AI can announce incoming phone calls and text messages. I tweak the video settings to the highest quality available, and change the voice of Meta AI to \"English (UK)\" so it can talk to me in the voice of Judi Dench. But with the $499 Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses, there's also a new step: deciding what the customizable \"action button\" should do. The action button isn't even my favorite part of using the glasses, but it's a sign of just how different these shades are from the rest of Meta's lineup. While the second-gen Ray-Ban and Oakley HSTN glasses iterated on the same formula Meta has used for the last few years, the Vanguard glasses are refreshingly different. They aren't really meant to be everyday sunglasses (unless you're really committed to your athletic pursuits) but they are in many ways more capable than Meta's other smart glasses. The speakers are louder, the camera has new abilities and they integrate directly with Strava and Garmin. And while these won't replace my go-to sunglasses, there's more than enough to make them part of my fitness routine.New look, new setupThe sunglasses were very clearly made with athletes in mind. The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses are the type of shades a lot of people probably think of when they hear \"Oakley sunglasses.\" The wraparound frames with colorful, reflective lenses are the style of glasses you might associate with a high school track coach, or your neighbor who is really serious about cycling.The pair I tested had black frames and Oakley's orange \"Prizm 24K\" lenses, which aren't polarized but are favored by a lot of athletes for their ability to dial up the contrast of your surroundings. I was able to comfortably wear my pair in bright, sunny conditions and also in more overcast lower light. I also appreciate that the lenses are swappable, so you can switch them out for a dedicated low-light or different-colored lens depending on your conditions. (Extra lenses cost $85 each and will be available to purchase separately soon, according to Meta.) These glasses don't, however, support prescription lenses of any kind. I wouldn't wear these as everyday sunglasses, but I don't mind the look for a trail run.Karissa Bell for EngadgetI realize this style of sunglasses won't be appealing to everyone, but the frame shape does enable a slightly different setup than what we've seen with any of Meta's other smart glasses. Most noticeably, the camera is in the center of the glasses, just above the nosebridge. The LED that lights up when the camera is on is also in the center, near the top of the frames. As with Meta's other smart glasses, you can control volume and music playback via a touchpad on the right side of the glasses, but the capture button to take photos and videos is now on the underside of the glasses rather than on top. This is meant to make it a bit easier to reach if you're wearing a hat or helmet, though I found it took me a few tries to get used to the new placement. Behind the capture button is the previously mentioned \"action button,\" which can be customized to trigger specific functions via the Meta AI app. The capture button (left) and the action button (right) are both on the underside of the frames rather than on top.Karissa Bell for EngadgetI haven't yet figured out what the best use for the action button is, though I've tried out a few different setups. On one hike, I set it up to automatically call my husband, kind of like a speed dial. During a bike ride, I had it set to record a hyperlapse video. I've also tried it out as a shortcut for launching a specific Spotify playlist or as a general trigger for Meta AI. With all of these, I appreciated that the action button allowed me to do something without saying the \"Hey Meta,\" command. Repeating \"hey Meta\" to my glasses in public has always felt a bit cringey, so it was nice to have a much more subtle cue available. Did I mention it's for athletes?The Vanguard's athlete-focused features go beyond the sportier frames. The shades come with new integrations for two of the most popular run and bike-tracking platforms: Garmin and Strava. If you have a supported Garmin watch or bike computer, you can set up the glasses to automatically capture video clips based on metrics from your activity, like hitting a particular heart rate zone or other milestone. You can also ask Meta AI directly to tell you about stats from your Garmin watch, like \"hey Meta, what's my pace.\" I don't have a Garmin watch, though I did briefly test out some of these features during my hands-on at Meta Connect. I suspect a lot of runners and cyclists may still find it easier to simply glance at their watch to see stats, but having it all available via voice commands doesn't seem like a bad thing either.Strava's integration isn't quite as deep. If you're tracking a run, hike or ride while wearing the glasses, you can overlay your stats directly onto photos and videos from your activity. This includes metrics like distance and elevation, as well as heart rate if you're also wearing an Apple Watch or other tracker that's connected to the Strava app. Here's what it looks like with a photo from a recent bike ride. You can overlay your Strava stats onto the photos and videos you record.Karissa Bell for EngadgetI typically don’t share stats from runs or bike rides (usually because they aren't that impressive) but it's a bit more appealing that just sharing a straight Strava screenshot. Another neat feature is that if you share a video, you can watch the stats change in real time alongside your recording. That level of detail isn't particularly interesting for a mostly flat bike ride on a city street, but I can see how it would be a lot more compelling on a more technical trail ride or in a race. My only complaint, really, is that Meta has limited these kinds of features to Garmin and Strava's platforms so far. I'd love to have support for my favorite ski-tracking app, Slopes, and I'm sure there are plenty of people who'd be happy to have an integration with their running or workout-tracking app of choice. Meta has announced some plans to bring more third-party apps onto its smart glasses platform so there might be hope here. There are other improvements, though, that will be appealing to even casual athletes. The speakers are a lot louder to account for potentially noisy conditions like a congested roadway or high-wind environment. I never had to crank the volume up anywhere near the max during my bike rides or runs, but I can say the speakers were loud and clear enough that I was able to comfortably listen to a podcast with the glasses laying next to me on the couch at full volume.The new centered camera placement is meant to make it harder for a hat or helmet to interfere with your shots, which has been a consistent issue for me with Meta's other smart glasses. The new position didn't totally solve this — I still found that my bike helmet made it into the top of my pics — but at least it's easier to crop out now that my headgear is centered over the top of my image rather than awkwardly sticking out on one side.The 12MP ultra-wide camera also comes with new video stabilization settings that make it feel a bit more like a replacement for an action cam. The glasses are set to automatically select a level of stabilization based on your motion, but you can also manually choose between low, medium or high stabilization (stabilization is locked at \"medium\" if you opt to record in 3K). I've mostly left it with the default settings and have been impressed with the results. The LED light is also a bit more subtle than on Meta's other smart glasses.Karissa Bell for EngadgetThe Vanguard glasses are also Meta's first smart glasses that can record hyperlapse and slow-motion video. Hyperlapse should be familiar to Instagram users who used the now-defunct app of the same name to record timelapse clips. Now, you can say \"Hey Meta, start a hyperlapse\" and the glasses will record a similar sped-up clip. My hyperlapse clips ended up looking a bit jittery, though, compared to the timelapse shots I'm used to getting with my GoPro. And unfortunately, there's no way to adjust the cadence of the video like you used to be able to with the dedicated app. My slow-motion clips, on the other hand, came out better. It's not something I'd expect to use very often during a bike ride or trail run, but the POV angle is great for recording clips of pets or kids. Meta is also planning to bring support for hyperlapse and slow-motion videos to the rest of its glasses lineup, though, so you don't need to get these particular shades to take advantage of the feature.The other major improvement is battery life. The Vanguard glasses have a notably better battery life compared with the second-gen Ray-Ban glasses or the HSTN frames (probably because the bigger frames allow for a larger battery). According to Meta, the Vanguard glasses can go nine hours on a charge with \"typical use\" or six hours with continuous audio playback. I was actually able to get a little over six hours of audio on a single charge, so they should hold up pretty well if you're running marathons or competing in longer races. As usual, exact battery life can vary a lot depending on how much you're using more resource-intensive features like video recording or Meta AI.The bigger frames and charging case give the glasses a battery life boost. Karissa Bell for EngadgetI'm especially looking forward to seeing how these glasses will hold up during a day of snowboarding. Meta previously told me that the battery has been optimized for a wider spectrum of temperatures so hopefully the battery won't drain as quickly on the mountain as Meta's other glasses. And with increased water resistance — the shades have an IP67 rating — I wouldn't worry about dropping them in the snow. Should you buy these?While Meta and EssilorLuxottica have gotten very good at making smart glasses (sorry Mark Zuckerberg, I won't call them \"AI glasses,\") they are still somewhat of a niche product. And the ultra-sporty Oakley Vanguard glasses are even more niche. At $499, these are also more expensive than other models.That, understandably, may feel too steep for a pair of sunglasses you're likely only going to wear during specific activities. But if you're a dedicated cyclist, runner, hiker or [insert outdoor activity of your choice], there's a lot to like. The camera makes a lot more sense for action cam-like POV footage, and better video stabilization means you're more likely to get shots you actually want to share. Ready-made Garmin and Strava integrations are practically begging for you to brag about your latest PR or race time, which will certainly appeal to many.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-review-sporty-to-a-fault-183000829.html?src=rss",

Did I mention it's for athletes?The Vanguard's athlete-focused features go beyond the sportier frames. The shades come with new integrations for two of the most popular run and bike-tracking platforms: Garmin and Strava. If you have a supported Garmin watch or bike computer, you can set up the glasses to automatically capture video clips based on metrics from your activity, like hitting a particular heart rate zone or other milestone. You can also ask Meta AI directly to tell you about stats from your Garmin watch, like \"hey Meta, what's my pace.\" I don't have a Garmin watch, though I did briefly test out some of these features during my hands-on at Meta Connect. I suspect a lot of runners and cyclists may still find it easier to simply glance at their watch to see stats, but having it all available via voice commands doesn't seem like a bad thing either.Strava's integration isn't quite as deep. If you're tracking a run, hike or ride while wearing the glasses, you can overlay your stats directly onto photos and videos from your activity. This includes metrics like distance and elevation, as well as heart rate if you're also wearing an Apple Watch or other tracker that's connected to the Strava app. Here's what it looks like with a photo from a recent bike ride. You can overlay your Strava stats onto the photos and videos you record.Karissa Bell for EngadgetI typically don’t share stats from runs or bike rides (usually because they aren't that impressive) but it's a bit more appealing that just sharing a straight Strava screenshot. Another neat feature is that if you share a video, you can watch the stats change in real time alongside your recording. That level of detail isn't particularly interesting for a mostly flat bike ride on a city street, but I can see how it would be a lot more compelling on a more technical trail ride or in a race. My only complaint, really, is that Meta has limited these kinds of features to Garmin and Strava's platforms so far. I'd love to have support for my favorite ski-tracking app, Slopes, and I'm sure there are plenty of people who'd be happy to have an integration with their running or workout-tracking app of choice. Meta has announced some plans to bring more third-party apps onto its smart glasses platform so there might be hope here. There are other improvements, though, that will be appealing to even casual athletes. The speakers are a lot louder to account for potentially noisy conditions like a congested roadway or high-wind environment. I never had to crank the volume up anywhere near the max during my bike rides or runs, but I can say the speakers were loud and clear enough that I was able to comfortably listen to a podcast with the glasses laying next to me on the couch at full volume.The new centered camera placement is meant to make it harder for a hat or helmet to interfere with your shots, which has been a consistent issue for me with Meta's other smart glasses. The new position didn't totally solve this — I still found that my bike helmet made it into the top of my pics — but at least it's easier to crop out now that my headgear is centered over the top of my image rather than awkwardly sticking out on one side.The 12MP ultra-wide camera also comes with new video stabilization settings that make it feel a bit more like a replacement for an action cam. The glasses are set to automatically select a level of stabilization based on your motion, but you can also manually choose between low, medium or high stabilization (stabilization is locked at \"medium\" if you opt to record in 3K). I've mostly left it with the default settings and have been impressed with the results. The LED light is also a bit more subtle than on Meta's other smart glasses.Karissa Bell for EngadgetThe Vanguard glasses are also Meta's first smart glasses that can record hyperlapse and slow-motion video. Hyperlapse should be familiar to Instagram users who used the now-defunct app of the same name to record timelapse clips. Now, you can say \"Hey Meta, start a hyperlapse\" and the glasses will record a similar sped-up clip. My hyperlapse clips ended up looking a bit jittery, though, compared to the timelapse shots I'm used to getting with my GoPro. And unfortunately, there's no way to adjust the cadence of the video like you used to be able to with the dedicated app. My slow-motion clips, on the other hand, came out better. It's not something I'd expect to use very often during a bike ride or trail run, but the POV angle is great for recording clips of pets or kids. Meta is also planning to bring support for hyperlapse and slow-motion videos to the rest of its glasses lineup, though, so you don't need to get these particular shades to take advantage of the feature.The other major improvement is battery life. The Vanguard glasses have a notably better battery life compared with the second-gen Ray-Ban glasses or the HSTN frames (probably because the bigger frames allow for a larger battery). According to Meta, the Vanguard glasses can go nine hours on a charge with \"typical use\" or six hours with continuous audio playback. I was actually able to get a little over six hours of audio on a single charge, so they should hold up pretty well if you're running marathons or competing in longer races. As usual, exact battery life can vary a lot depending on how much you're using more resource-intensive features like video recording or Meta AI.The bigger frames and charging case give the glasses a battery life boost. Karissa Bell for EngadgetI'm especially looking forward to seeing how these glasses will hold up during a day of snowboarding. Meta previously told me that the battery has been optimized for a wider spectrum of temperatures so hopefully the battery won't drain as quickly on the mountain as Meta's other glasses. And with increased water resistance — the shades have an IP67 rating — I wouldn't worry about dropping them in the snow. Should you buy these?While Meta and EssilorLuxottica have gotten very good at making smart glasses (sorry Mark Zuckerberg, I won't call them \"AI glasses,\") they are still somewhat of a niche product. And the ultra-sporty Oakley Vanguard glasses are even more niche. At $499, these are also more expensive than other models.That, understandably, may feel too steep for a pair of sunglasses you're likely only going to wear during specific activities. But if you're a dedicated cyclist, runner, hiker or [insert outdoor activity of your choice], there's a lot to like. The camera makes a lot more sense for action cam-like POV footage, and better video stabilization means you're more likely to get shots you actually want to share. Ready-made Garmin and Strava integrations are practically begging for you to brag about your latest PR or race time, which will certainly appeal to many.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-review-sporty-to-a-fault-183000829.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Fractal Design Scape review: A stellar debut",
          "standfirst": "Unless you're a PC nerd like me, chances are you're not familiar with Fractal Design. The company has made a name for itself in recent years by designing some of the best cases you can buy for a DIY build. In a space known for its gaudy aesthetics, Fractal's products stand out for their simplicity. Now the company is entering the crowded audio space with the $200 Scape, a gaming headset that not only looks sophisticated, but also sounds surprisingly great too. Design The Fractal Scape features an attractive mix of materials. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget I mentioned the design of the Scape first, and for good reason. It shows attention to detail, with a lot of thoughtful flourishes. The best of those is the dock that comes included with the headset. It charges the Scape inductively, so there's no need to align any charging pins, and it cleverly houses the headset's 2.4GHz wireless transmitter. When connected to your main PC, the dongle can sit inside the dock, ready to go when you want to use it with your PlayStation 5, PS4, Nintendo Switch or another PC or Mac (sorry, Microsoft fans, there's no Xbox support). The base also has wire channels to make cable management easy. Those same thoughtful design touches extend to the headset itself. On the back are four buttons, a dial and a toggle that cover nearly every function of the Scape. You can adjust the volume, mute the built-in mic, switch between 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connectivity, power the headset on or off, turn the RGB lighting on or off and switch between three EQ presets. What’s more, all of the controls feel distinct and are easy to use. There's also a USB-C connection for wired audio and a three-pole headphone jack for the detachable microphone. The headset is primarily made of plastic, with a touch of brushed metal. Fractal offers the Scape in two colors — the aptly named light and dark — and despite the company's choice of materials, the headset feels undoubtedly premium. Tilt adjustment is limited — it's not possible to lay the ear pads flat on a table, for example — but the headband offers a fair amount of resistance, adding to the high-end feel. That said, the Scape could be more comfortable. Clamping force feels just about right, but there's not enough padding along the top of the headband. I found I could wear the headphones for a few hours, but I eventually had to take them off to relieve the pressure that had built up on the top of my head. I'm also not a fan of the fabric Fractal used for both the headband and ear pads. It feels scratchy and it's not great at dissipating heat. Thankfully, the high-density memory foam beneath is plush and the pads were deep and wide enough to comfortably accommodate my ears. Fractal has made it easy to swap the ear pads if needed; they come right off with just a small amount of force. For the time being, the company isn't selling replacements, but a spokesperson told me Fractal will send customers who need new pads a set for free. You just need to contact their support team. Sound quality The Scape comes with a set of custom-tuned drivers. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget Out of the box, the Scape's dynamic drivers are tuned to a soft v-shaped curve, with an emphasis on accuracy over character. Bass frequencies are punchy without being bloated, and there's nice detail to mid-focused instruments like guitars. To my ear, the one issue with the Scape's default tuning were the upper mids and treble frequencies. They weren't shouty to the point of being sibilant, but there was definitely a harshness to the vocals of singers like Jeff Buckley and Caroline Polachek who are known for their falsetto. Thankfully, this was easy to fix with the Scape's built-in EQ settings. I'll have more to say in the software section of this review, but Fractal's Adjust app allows you to make parametric EQ adjustments. This is different to most gaming headsets, which often limit people to restrictive fixed-band tweaks. Even when I used just five potential points of customization, I found I had a great deal of control over the tonality of the Scape. Overall, for casual music listening these are excellent headphones capable of covering many different genres. When it comes to gaming, they're great too — with some caveats. For singleplayer games, the default tunings are an excellent match. Playing Ghost of Tsushima, the Scape did a great job of reproducing the game's immersive sound design, allowing me to soak in all the little audio details Sucker Punch packed into its rendition of 13th century Japan. The soundstaging isn't as expansive and lush as I'm used to with my Sennheiser HD 600, but for a pair of closed-back headphones, it's above average. When it comes to competitive first-person shooters, some tweaks are required. I found all the default presets produced too much bass to easily isolate sound cues in games like Valorant. Again, Fractal's software made this simple to fix; however, the Scape can only store three presets. Some gaming headsets, particularly those from Steelseries, come with tunings for hundreds of different games. For the ultra-competitive gamer, this can be useful since every game has a different sound engine. I'm not one of those people, so I found the Scape had just the right amount of customization. A closeup of the Scape's volume dial. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget One feature you won't find on these headphones is active noise cancellation (ANC). Don't get me wrong, ANC is great, but I also didn't feel like the Scape was a worse product without it. My girlfriend is a Pelton fanatic and she does all of her daily classes without wearing headphones in our small apartment. In that situation, the Scape's passive noise isolation was enough to block the loud music coming from those workouts. That said, the one area where the Scape could have been better is Bluetooth connectivity. It's a 5.3 headset, but codec support is limited to SBC and AAC. If you've ever tried a pair of wireless headphones only to be disappointed by how they sounded, SBC was probably to blame. When I used the Scape over Bluetooth, there was a subtle difference, but in a beat 'em up like Absolum, the game's excellent sound design was less effective because it sounded more compressed, with more lag between what was happening on-screen and the effects that followed. I would have liked to see Fractal support more modern codecs like aptX Adaptive, but given that you need a dongle like the Creative BT-W6 to get access to those protocols on PCs and consoles, I can't fault the company for its decision. Also missing from the Bluetooth equation is multipoint support, meaning I wasn't able to connect the Scape to my PC or Switch and my iPhone at the same time. The Scape's detachable microphone is fine but uninspiring. In listening back to a chat I had with some friends over Discord, I found the Scape compressed my voice to the point where there wasn't a lot of life or nuance to it. The optional noise cancellation algorithm does a good job of filtering out nearby commotion, but does so at the expense of adding more compression. You can flip the microphone to mute yourself, and if you're feeling lazy, the Scape also has a built-in mic — though it sounds about as good as you might imagine. Still, it's handy in a pinch. Software Fractal's Adjust app is web-based and easy to use. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget I mentioned Fractal's Adjust software, but what I didn't note is that it's not an app you need to install on your computer. Instead, it's a website you can access through any Chrome-based browser. It's a small thing, but one I really appreciate. I can't count how many times I've had to troubleshoot issues with Windows that were caused by a conflict created by Logitech G Hub or NZXT Cam. The web-based software itself is simple, with two pages, named Lighting and Audio, encompassing all the options you can tweak. The Scape comes with 10 lighting themes out of the box, and like the headset itself, these presets are understated and classy. Naturally, you can also create your own lighting schemes, and the tool for doing so is fairly robust. A closeup of the Fractal Scape's EQ button Igor Bonifacic for Engadget When it comes to the EQ adjustments you can make with the Adjust app, the one thing I'll add here is any presets you save are stored on the Scape, so they're available everywhere you want to use the headset. That was great because it meant I didn't need to Alt-Tab out of a game to switch the headset to a more competitive tuning. The one area where Fractal's software feels lacking is when it comes to microphone controls. It's possible to adjust sidetone (the volume of your mic input as heard through the headset) and enable microphone noise cancellation, but that’s it. It'd be nice if it was possible to configure those settings for the two mics independently of one another, but the software doesn't support that right now. Battery life According to Fractal, the Scape can go up to 40 hours on a single charge with RGB lighting off. With the feature turned on, battery life drops to about 26 hours. I'll be honest, I had a tough time putting those claims to the test because of how easy it is to charge the headset. As best as I can tell, those estimates are accurate. I managed to get three days of battery life from the Scape with the RGB lights turned on and about eight hours of use each day. One nice touch: when you tap the power button, the RGB lights will briefly illuminate to indicate how much battery life the Scape has left. Those same lights will turn off when you place the headset to charge so that they're not distracting. The competition With the Scape, Fractal has entered a crowded market. That said, the Scape is competitive with some of the best gaming headsets you can buy right now. At $200, it's $100 cheaper than the Audeze Maxwell, Engadget's pick for the best premium gaming headset. The Scape doesn't sound as good as the Maxwell or offer LDAC support for Bluetooth connectivity, but it's lighter and charging is easier thanks to the included charging base. If you ask me, the Scape also looks a lot better too. If you can't live without ANC, your best bet is Razer's BlackShark V3 Pro, but it costs $50 more and doesn't sound as good as the Scape. You also need to put up with Razer's annoying Synapse software. For the best mic on a gaming headset, my longstanding recommendation has been the $199 Drop PC38X. It also has one of the best default tunings for competitive gaming. However, it's a wired headset, and Drop doesn’t offer a wireless option. Wrap-up The charging station also houses the Scape's 2.4GHz transmitter. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget If you can't tell by now, I think the Fractal Scape is a great gaming headset. There are models like the Audeze Maxwell that beat it in one or two categories, but for $200 the Scape is an excellent all-around package. Nitpicks about comfort aside, the Scape sounds and looks great. It's also a tremendous first effort by Fractal, and I can't wait to see what the company does next in the audio space and beyond.

Wrap-up The charging station also houses the Scape's 2.4GHz transmitter. Igor Bonifacic for Engadget If you can't tell by now, I think the Fractal Scape is a great gaming headset. There are models like the Audeze Maxwell that beat it in one or two categories, but for $200 the Scape is an excellent all-around package. Nitpicks about comfort aside, the Scape sounds and looks great. It's also a tremendous first effort by Fractal, and I can't wait to see what the company does next in the audio space and beyond.

          "standfirst": "It's been around three and a half years since season four of Stranger Things premiered. We finally have an actual trailer for the fifth and final season of Netflix's retro-soaked adventure series. It's a good thing, as the first batch of episodes drop on November 26. As previously mentioned, this is a real trailer with tons of footage and not a teaser. It's over two minutes of Hawkins-based goodness. This is an action-packed affair that's heavy on emotion and light on the type of 1980s-style humor the show has become known for. That seems right, given the stakes are higher than ever. If you just clicked on this and don't plan on actually watching the trailer, this is when I go into some light spoilers. It looks like the gang is trapped in Hawkins following the events of season four. There's a military enclosure around the city and, surprise, Vecna is back and looking for vengeance. There's a very scary scene in which the entity looks to be controlling or torturing poor Will and we don't even know if he has a cassette player loaded with Kate Bush just out of frame. It's all very tense. While the show premieres on November 26, this isn't a one-and-done season drop like many Netflix shows. It's being split into three installments. The first batch of episodes are set for November 26, with another batch dropping on December 25. The final episode will air on December 31 and is even coming to some movie theaters. It's a holiday miracle. The showrunners do promise that this season will finally tell us exactly what the upside down is, which is something to look forward to. While Stranger Things is ending, the franchise will continue on. Netflix has some spinoffs planned for the future, but they won't have series creators the Duffer Brothers on board as showrunners. The pair recently signed a deal with Paramount.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/we-finally-have-a-real-deal-trailer-for-stranger-things-season-five-160222670.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Norton Security has some reliable products, but its VPN isn't one of them. In my Norton VPN review, I argued that it's only really worthwhile if you can get a discount on it as part of a Norton 360 package — and even in that case, you should only use it for non-sensitive activities due to some holes in Norton's comprehensive privacy policy. That's a lot of conditions, so I'd understand if you're here because you've decided Norton VPN isn't for you. Read on to learn your options for cancelling this VPN, getting a refund and replacing it with a better provider. How to turn off Norton VPN auto-renewal The simplest way to cancel Norton VPN is to stop your subscription from automatically renewing. That way, you'll have until your plan expires to look for a new VPN. Note that the steps below are the same no matter how you got Norton VPN, whether on its own or as part of Norton 360 — though they only apply if you subscribed through the Norton website, not an app store. Sign into your account at my.norton.com. You'll be taken to your account dashboard with your subscriptions tab visible. If it's not, click on My Subscriptions. On your subscriptions hub, find the plan you get Norton VPN through. Click the words Manage Renewal or Cancel Subscription Renewal. In the window that appears, click Unsubscribe. Select a reason for cancellation (no need to be truthful) and click Next. At this point, you'll have to wade through several pleas for you to stay. Stand firm and keep clicking through until you can click No thanks, cancel my subscription. Continue clicking Next until you see a confirmation that auto-renewal has been turned off. Wait 24 hours for the change to take effect. Sam Chapman for Engadget If you change your mind after turning auto-renewal off, you can turn it back on again anytime before the subscription expires. For those who bought through an app store, there's no way to turn off auto-renewal; you can only cancel the subscription altogether. See the end of the next section to learn how to do that. How to cancel Norton VPN and get a refund You can request a refund on any annual subscription for 60 days after paying. Monthly subscriptions can only be refunded once, within 14 days of paying — if you renew a monthly plan then decide to cancel, you're out of luck. The only way to get a refund is to contact Norton directly. If you're ready to go cold turkey, follow these steps. In a browser, open support.norton.com. Scroll down until you see nine buttons arranged in a 3x3 grid. Find the second button down in the left-hand column, Contact us, and click on it. Enter the email address for your Norton account. Check that inbox for a verification code, then enter it in the next box and click Verify. When the live chat asks you what you need help with, select Purchase & Billing, then Request refund. Give a reason in the dropdown menu. As usual, be persistent until you get a message in writing that your refund will be processed. Wait at least three days for the money to appear. Sam Chapman for Engadget If you subscribed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, you'll have to cancel through the same platform where you started. Just go into the subscriptions page of the store's mobile app, find your Norton VPN subscription and click the Cancel button beside it. After that, just follow the prompts, then request a refund using the steps above. How to uninstall Norton VPN To get your money back from Norton, you can't just shut off auto-renewal. You'll have to cancel your plan immediately and delete all Norton apps from your devices. I recommend following these steps even if you aren't eligible for a refund, since Norton software is notoriously hard to uninstall and will crop back up if you don't completely root it out. On Android and iOS, uninstalling Norton VPN is relatively easy — after cancelling your subscription, delete it like you would any other app. Things are a bit trickier on the desktop OSes. On Windows, hold the Windows key and press R to make a black box appear. Type appwiz.cpl and hit Enter. A list of programs should appear; click on Norton VPN, then click Uninstall/Change and follow the instructions. On a Mac, open your Applications folder and find Norton VPN. Click the app icon and drag it to the trash. This should start a separate program called Norton Uninstaller. Click OK, enter your password if asked, then click Uninstall. Finally, you'll need to restart your computer to finish uninstalling. Norton VPN alternatives Once you've dispensed with Norton VPN, you can get started with a provider that fits your needs better. Proton VPN, my current top pick in our guide to the best VPNs, takes privacy more seriously than Norton and has superior app design and speeds. Surfshark is the fastest VPN, NordVPN has the best features and ExpressVPN is the friendliest for beginners.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-cancel-norton-vpn-uninstall-it-and-get-your-money-back-150000872.html?src=rss",

          "title": "What's next for Vision Pro? Apple should take a cue from Xreal's smart glasses",
          "standfirst": "Forget Samsung's $1,800 Galaxy XR, the Android XR device I'm actually intrigued to see is Xreal's Project Aura, an evolution of the company's existing smart glasses. Instead of being an expensive and bulky headset like the Galaxy XR and Apple Vision Pro, Xreal's devices are like over-sized sunglasses that project a virtual display atop transparent lenses. I genuinely loved Xreal's $649 One Pro for its comfort, screen size and relative affordability. Now that I'm testing the M5-equipped Vision Pro (full review to come soon!), it's clearer than ever that Apple should replicate Xreal's winning formula. It'll be a long while before we'll ever see a smaller Vision Pro-like device under $1,000, but Apple could easily build a similar set of comfortable smart glasses that more people could actually afford. And if they worked like Xreal's glasses, they'd also be far more useful than something like Meta's $800 Ray-Ban Display, which only has a small screen for notifications and quick tasks like video chats. Xreal One Pro smart glassesDevindra Hardawar for EngadgetWhile we don't have any pricing details for Project Aura yet, given Xreal's history of delivering devices between $200 and $649, I'd bet they'll come in cheaper than the Galaxy XR. Xreal's existing hardware is less complex than the Vision Pro and Galaxy XR, with smaller displays, a more limited field of view and no built-in battery. Project Aura differs a bit with its tethered computing puck, which will be used to power Android XR and presumably hold a battery. That component alone could drive its price up to $1,000 — but hey, that's better than $1,800.During my time with the M5 Vision Pro, I couldn't help but imagine how Apple could bring visionOS to its own Xreal-like hardware, which I'll call the \"Vision Air\" for this thought experiment. The basic sunglasses design is easy enough to replicate, and I could see Apple leaning into lighter and more premium materials to make wearing the Vision Air even more comfortable than Xreal's devices. There's no doubt it would be lighter than the 1.6-pound Vision Pro, and since you'd still be seeing the real world, it also avoids the sense of being trapped in a dark VR headset. To power the Vision Air, Apple could repurpose the Vision Pro's battery pack and turn it into a computing puck like Project Aura's. It wouldn't need the full capabilities of the M5 chip, it would just have to be smart enough to juggle virtual windows, map objects in 3D space and run most visionOS apps. The Vision Air also wouldn't need the full array of cameras and sensors from the Vision Pro, just enough track your fingers and eyes. I could also see Apple matching, or even surpassing, Project Aura's 70-degree field of view, which is already a huge leap beyond the Xreal One Pro's 57-degree FOV. Xreal's earlier devices were severely limited by a small FOV, which meant that you could only see virtual screens through a tiny sliver. (That's a problem that also plagued early AR headsets like Microsoft's HoloLens.) While wearing the Xreal One Pro, though, I could see a huge 222-inch virtual display within my view. Pushing the FOV even higher would be even more immersive.In my review of the original Vision Pro, I wrote, \"If Apple just sold a headset that virtualized your Mac's screen for $1,000 this well, I'd imagine creative professionals and power users would be all over it.\" That may be an achievable goal for the Vision Air, especially if it's not chasing total XR immersion. And even if the Apple tax pushed the price up to $1,500, it would still be more sensible than the Vision Pro’s $3,500 cost. While I don’t have high hopes for Android XR, its mere existence should be enough to push Apple to double-down on visionOS and deliver something people can actually afford. If Xreal can design comfortable and functional smart glasses for a fraction of the Vision Pro’s cost, why can't Apple?

          "content": "Forget Samsung's $1,800 Galaxy XR, the Android XR device I'm actually intrigued to see is Xreal's Project Aura, an evolution of the company's existing smart glasses. Instead of being an expensive and bulky headset like the Galaxy XR and Apple Vision Pro, Xreal's devices are like over-sized sunglasses that project a virtual display atop transparent lenses. I genuinely loved Xreal's $649 One Pro for its comfort, screen size and relative affordability. Now that I'm testing the M5-equipped Vision Pro (full review to come soon!), it's clearer than ever that Apple should replicate Xreal's winning formula. It'll be a long while before we'll ever see a smaller Vision Pro-like device under $1,000, but Apple could easily build a similar set of comfortable smart glasses that more people could actually afford. And if they worked like Xreal's glasses, they'd also be far more useful than something like Meta's $800 Ray-Ban Display, which only has a small screen for notifications and quick tasks like video chats. Xreal One Pro smart glassesDevindra Hardawar for EngadgetWhile we don't have any pricing details for Project Aura yet, given Xreal's history of delivering devices between $200 and $649, I'd bet they'll come in cheaper than the Galaxy XR. Xreal's existing hardware is less complex than the Vision Pro and Galaxy XR, with smaller displays, a more limited field of view and no built-in battery. Project Aura differs a bit with its tethered computing puck, which will be used to power Android XR and presumably hold a battery. That component alone could drive its price up to $1,000 — but hey, that's better than $1,800.During my time with the M5 Vision Pro, I couldn't help but imagine how Apple could bring visionOS to its own Xreal-like hardware, which I'll call the \"Vision Air\" for this thought experiment. The basic sunglasses design is easy enough to replicate, and I could see Apple leaning into lighter and more premium materials to make wearing the Vision Air even more comfortable than Xreal's devices. There's no doubt it would be lighter than the 1.6-pound Vision Pro, and since you'd still be seeing the real world, it also avoids the sense of being trapped in a dark VR headset. To power the Vision Air, Apple could repurpose the Vision Pro's battery pack and turn it into a computing puck like Project Aura's. It wouldn't need the full capabilities of the M5 chip, it would just have to be smart enough to juggle virtual windows, map objects in 3D space and run most visionOS apps. The Vision Air also wouldn't need the full array of cameras and sensors from the Vision Pro, just enough track your fingers and eyes. I could also see Apple matching, or even surpassing, Project Aura's 70-degree field of view, which is already a huge leap beyond the Xreal One Pro's 57-degree FOV. Xreal's earlier devices were severely limited by a small FOV, which meant that you could only see virtual screens through a tiny sliver. (That's a problem that also plagued early AR headsets like Microsoft's HoloLens.) While wearing the Xreal One Pro, though, I could see a huge 222-inch virtual display within my view. Pushing the FOV even higher would be even more immersive.In my review of the original Vision Pro, I wrote, \"If Apple just sold a headset that virtualized your Mac's screen for $1,000 this well, I'd imagine creative professionals and power users would be all over it.\" That may be an achievable goal for the Vision Air, especially if it's not chasing total XR immersion. And even if the Apple tax pushed the price up to $1,500, it would still be more sensible than the Vision Pro’s $3,500 cost. While I don’t have high hopes for Android XR, its mere existence should be enough to push Apple to double-down on visionOS and deliver something people can actually afford. If Xreal can design comfortable and functional smart glasses for a fraction of the Vision Pro’s cost, why can't Apple?

          "standfirst": "The rise of AI marks a critical shift away from decades defined by information-chasing and a push for more and more compute power. Canva co-founder and CPO Cameron Adams refers to this dawning time as the “imagination era.” Meaning: Individuals and enterprises must be able to turn creativity into action with AI. Canva hopes to position itself at the center of this shift with a sweeping new suite of tools. The company’s new Creative Operating System (COS) integrates AI across every layer of content creation, creating a single, comprehensive creativity platform rather than a simple, template-based design tool.“We’re entering a new era where we need to rethink how we achieve our goals,” said Adams. “We’re enabling people’s imagination and giving them the tools they need to take action.”An &#x27;engine&#x27; for creativityAdams describes Canva’s platform as a three-layer stack: The top Visual Suite layer containing designs, images and other content; a collaborative Canva AI plane at center; and a foundational proprietary model holding it all up. At the heart of Canva’s strategy is its Creative Operating System (COS) underlying. This “engine,” as Adams describes it, integrates documents, websites, presentations, sheets, whiteboards, videos, social content, hundreds of millions of photos, illustrations, a rich sound library, and numerous templates, charts, and branded elements.The COS is getting a 2.0 upgrade, but the crucial advance is the “middle, crucial layer” that fully integrates AI and makes it accessible throughout various workflows, Adams explained. This gives creative and technical teams a single dashboard for generating, editing and launching all types of content.The underlying model is trained to understand the “complexity of design” so the platform can build out various elements — such as photos, videos, textures, or 3D graphics — in real time, matching branding style without the need for manual adjustments. It also supports live collaboration, meaning teams across departments can co-create. With a unified dashboard, a user working on a specific design, for instance, can create a new piece of content (say, a presentation) within the same workflow, without having to switch to another window or platform. Also, if they generate an image and aren’t pleased with it, they don’t have to go back and create from scratch; they can immediately begin editing, changing colors or tone. Another new capability in COS, “Ask Canva,” provides direct design advice. Users can tag @Canva to get copy suggestions and smart edits; or, they can highlight an image and direct the AI assistant to modify it or generate variants. “It’s a really unique interaction,” said Adams, noting that this AI design partner is always present. “It’s a real collaboration between people and AI, and we think it’s a revolutionary change.”Other new features include a 2.0 video editor and interactive form and email design with drag-and-drop tools. Further, Canva is now incorporated with Affinity, its unified app for pro designers incorporating vector, pixel and layer workflows, and Affinity is “free forever.” Automating intelligence, supporting marketingBranding is critical for enterprise; Canva has introduced new tools to help organizations consistently showcase theirs across platforms. The new Canva Grow engine integrates business objectives into the creative process so teams can workshop, create, distribute and refine ads and other materials. As Adams explained: “It automatically scans your website, figures out who your audience is, what assets you use to promote your products, the message it needs to send out, the formats you want to send it out in, makes a creative for you, and you can deploy it directly to the platform without having to leave Canva.”Marketing teams can now design and launch ads across platforms like Meta, track insights as they happen and refine future content based on performance metrics. “Your brand system is now available inside the AI you’re working with,” Adams noted. Success metrics and enterprise adoptionThe impact of Canva’s COS is reflected in notable user metrics: More than 250 million people use Canva every month, just over 29 million of which are paid subscribers. Adams reports that 41 billion designs have been created on Canva since launch, which equates to 1 billion each month. “If you break that down, it turns into the crazy number of 386 designs being created every single second,” said Adams. Whereas in the early days, it took roughly an hour for users to create a single design. Canva customers include Walmart, Disney, Virgin Voyages, Pinterest, FedEx, Expedia and eXp Realty. DocuSign, for one, reported that it unlocked more than 500 hours of team capacity and saved $300,000-plus in design hours by fully integrating Canva into its content creation. Disney, meanwhile, uses translation capabilities for its internationalization work, Adams said. Competitors in the design spaceCanva plays in an evolving landscape of professional design tools including Adobe Express and Figma; AI-powered challengers led by Microsoft Designer; and direct consumer alternatives like Visme and Piktochart.Adobe Express (starting at $9.99 a month for premium features) is known for its ease of use and integration with the broader Adobe Creative Cloud ecosystem. It features professional-grade templates and access to Adobe’s extensive stock library, and has incorporated Google&#x27;s Gemini 2.5 Flash image model and other gen AI features so that designers can create graphics via natural language prompts. Users with some design experience say they prefer its interface, controls and technical advantages over Canva (such as the ability to import high-fidelity PDFs). Figma (starting at $3 a month for professional plans) is touted for its real-time collaboration, advanced prototyping capabilities and deep integration with dev workflows; however, some say it has a steeper learning curve and higher-precision design tools, making it preferable for professional designers, developers and product teams working on more complex projects. Microsoft Designer (free version available; although a Microsoft 365 subscription starting at $9.99 a month unlocks additional features) benefits from its integration with Microsoft’s AI capabilities, Copilot layout and text generation and Dall-E powered image generation. The platform’s “Inspire Me” and “New Ideas” buttons provide design variations, and users can also import data from Excel, add 3D models from PowerPoint and access images from OneDrive. However, users report that its stock photos and template and image libraries are limited compared to Canva&#x27;s extensive collection, and its visuals can come across as outdated. Canva’s advantage seems to be in its extensive template library (more than 600,000 ready-to-use) and asset library (141 million-plus stock photos, videos, graphics, and audio elements).​ Its platform is also praised for its ease of use and interface friendly to non-designers, allowing them to begin quickly without training. Canva has also expanded into a variety of content types — documents, websites, presentations, whiteboards, videos, and more — making its platform a comprehensive visual suite than just a graphics tool. Canva has four pricing tiers: Canva Free for one user; Canva Pro for $120 a year for one person; Canva Teams for $100 a year for each team member; and the custom-priced Canva Enterprise. Key takeaways: Be open, embrace human-AI collaborationCanva’s COS is underpinned by Canva’s frontier model, an in-house, proprietary engine based on years of R&D and research partnerships, including the acquisition of visual AI company Leonardo. Adams notes that Canva works with top AI providers including OpenAI, Anthropic and Google. For technology teams, Canva’s approach offers important lessons, including a commitment to openness. “There are so many models floating around,” Adams noted; it’s important for enterprises to recognize when they should work with top models and when they should develop their own proprietary ones, he advised. For instance, OpenAI and Anthropic recently announced integrations with Canva as a visual layer because, as Adams explained, they realized they didn’t have the capability to create the same kinds of editable designs that Canva can. This creates a mutually-beneficial ecosystem. Ultimately, Adams noted: “We have this underlying philosophy that the future is people and technology working together. It&#x27;s not an either or. We want people to be at the center, to be the ones with the creative spark, and to use AI as a collaborator.”",

          "standfirst": "Researchers at Meta FAIR and the University of Edinburgh have developed a new technique that can predict the correctness of a large language model&#x27;s (LLM) reasoning and even intervene to fix its mistakes. Called Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV), the method looks inside an LLM to monitor its internal “reasoning circuits” and detect signs of computational errors as the model solves a problem.Their findings show that CRV can detect reasoning errors in LLMs with high accuracy by building and observing a computational graph from the model&#x27;s internal activations. In a key breakthrough, the researchers also demonstrated they can use this deep insight to apply targeted interventions that correct a model’s faulty reasoning on the fly.The technique could help solve one of the great challenges of AI: Ensuring a model’s reasoning is faithful and correct. This could be a critical step toward building more trustworthy AI applications for the enterprise, where reliability is paramount.Investigating chain-of-thought reasoningChain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been a powerful method for boosting the performance of LLMs on complex tasks and has been one of the key ingredients in the success of reasoning models such as the OpenAI o-series and DeepSeek-R1. However, despite the success of CoT, it is not fully reliable. The reasoning process itself is often flawed, and several studies have shown that the CoT tokens an LLM generates is not always a faithful representation of its internal reasoning process.Current remedies for verifying CoT fall into two main categories. “Black-box” approaches analyze the final generated token or the confidence scores of different token options. “Gray-box” approaches go a step further, looking at the model&#x27;s internal state by using simple probes on its raw neural activations. But while these methods can detect that a model’s internal state is correlated with an error, they can&#x27;t explain why the underlying computation failed. For real-world applications where understanding the root cause of a failure is crucial, this is a significant gap.A white-box approach to verificationCRV is based on the idea that models perform tasks using specialized subgraphs, or \"circuits,\" of neurons that function like latent algorithms. So if the model’s reasoning fails, it is caused by a flaw in the execution of one of these algorithms. This means that by inspecting the underlying computational process, we can diagnose the cause of the flaw, similar to how developers examine execution traces to debug traditional software.To make this possible, the researchers first make the target LLM interpretable. They replace the standard dense layers of the transformer blocks with trained \"transcoders.\" A transcoder is a specialized deep learning component that forces the model to represent its intermediate computations not as a dense, unreadable vector of numbers, but as a sparse and meaningful set of features. Transcoders are similar to the sparse autoencoders (SAE) used in mechanistic interpretability research with the difference that they also preserve the functionality of the network they emulate. This modification effectively installs a diagnostic port into the model, allowing researchers to observe its internal workings.With this interpretable model in place, the CRV process unfolds in a few steps. For each reasoning step the model takes, CRV constructs an \"attribution graph\" that maps the causal flow of information between the interpretable features of the transcoder and the tokens it is processing. From this graph, it extracts a \"structural fingerprint\" that contains a set of features describing the graph&#x27;s properties. Finally, a “diagnostic classifier” model is trained on these fingerprints to predict whether the reasoning step is correct or not.At inference time, the classifier monitors the activations of the model and provides feedback on whether the model’s reasoning trace is on the right track.Finding and fixing errorsThe researchers tested their method on a Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model modified with the transcoders, evaluating it on a mix of synthetic (Boolean and Arithmetic) and real-world (GSM8K math problems) datasets. They compared CRV against a comprehensive suite of black-box and gray-box baselines.The results provide strong empirical support for the central hypothesis: the structural signatures in a reasoning step&#x27;s computational trace contain a verifiable signal of its correctness. CRV consistently outperformed all baseline methods across every dataset and metric, demonstrating that a deep, structural view of the model&#x27;s computation is more powerful than surface-level analysis.Interestingly, the analysis revealed that the signatures of error are highly domain-specific. This means failures in different reasoning tasks (formal logic versus arithmetic calculation) manifest as distinct computational patterns. A classifier trained to detect errors in one domain does not transfer well to another, highlighting that different types of reasoning rely on different internal circuits. In practice, this means that you might need to train a separate classifier for each task (though the transcoder remains unchanged).The most significant finding, however, is that these error signatures are not just correlational but causal. Because CRV provides a transparent view of the computation, a predicted failure can be traced back to a specific component. In one case study, the model made an order-of-operations error. CRV flagged the step and identified that a \"multiplication\" feature was firing prematurely. The researchers intervened by manually suppressing that single feature, and the model immediately corrected its path and solved the problem correctly. This work represents a step toward a more rigorous science of AI interpretability and control. As the paper concludes, “these findings establish CRV as a proof-of-concept for mechanistic analysis, showing that shifting from opaque activations to interpretable computational structure enables a causal understanding of how and why LLMs fail to reason correctly.” To support further research, the team plans to release its datasets and trained transcoders to the public.Why it’s importantWhile CRV is a research proof-of-concept, its results hint at a significant future for AI development. AI models learn internal algorithms, or \"circuits,\" for different tasks. But because these models are opaque, we can&#x27;t debug them like standard computer programs by tracing bugs to specific steps in the computation. Attribution graphs are the closest thing we have to an execution trace, showing how an output is derived from intermediate steps.This research suggests that attribution graphs could be the foundation for a new class of AI model debuggers. Such tools would allow developers to understand the root cause of failures, whether it&#x27;s insufficient training data or interference between competing tasks. This would enable precise mitigations, like targeted fine-tuning or even direct model editing, instead of costly full-scale retraining. They could also allow for more efficient intervention to correct model mistakes during inference.The success of CRV in detecting and pinpointing reasoning errors is an encouraging sign that such debuggers could become a reality. This would pave the way for more robust LLMs and autonomous agents that can handle real-world unpredictability and, much like humans, correct course when they make reasoning mistakes.",

As the paper concludes, “these findings establish CRV as a proof-of-concept for mechanistic analysis, showing that shifting from opaque activations to interpretable computational structure enables a causal understanding of how and why LLMs fail to reason correctly.” To support further research, the team plans to release its datasets and trained transcoders to the public.Why it’s importantWhile CRV is a research proof-of-concept, its results hint at a significant future for AI development. AI models learn internal algorithms, or \"circuits,\" for different tasks. But because these models are opaque, we can&#x27;t debug them like standard computer programs by tracing bugs to specific steps in the computation. Attribution graphs are the closest thing we have to an execution trace, showing how an output is derived from intermediate steps.This research suggests that attribution graphs could be the foundation for a new class of AI model debuggers. Such tools would allow developers to understand the root cause of failures, whether it&#x27;s insufficient training data or interference between competing tasks. This would enable precise mitigations, like targeted fine-tuning or even direct model editing, instead of costly full-scale retraining. They could also allow for more efficient intervention to correct model mistakes during inference.The success of CRV in detecting and pinpointing reasoning errors is an encouraging sign that such debuggers could become a reality. This would pave the way for more robust LLMs and autonomous agents that can handle real-world unpredictability and, much like humans, correct course when they make reasoning mistakes.",

          "title": "Vibe coding platform Cursor releases first in-house LLM, Composer, promising 4X speed boost",
          "standfirst": "The vibe coding tool Cursor, from startup Anysphere, has introduced Composer, its first in-house, proprietary coding large language model (LLM) as part of its Cursor 2.0 platform update. Composer is designed to execute coding tasks quickly and accurately in production-scale environments, representing a new step in AI-assisted programming. It&#x27;s already being used by Cursor’s own engineering staff in day-to-day development — indicating maturity and stability.According to Cursor, Composer completes most interactions in less than 30 seconds while maintaining a high level of reasoning ability across large and complex codebases. The model is described as four times faster than similarly intelligent systems and is trained for “agentic” workflows—where autonomous coding agents plan, write, test, and review code collaboratively.Previously, Cursor supported \"vibe coding\" — using AI to write or complete code based on natural language instructions from a user, even someone untrained in development — atop other leading proprietary LLMs from the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI. These options are still available to users.Benchmark ResultsComposer’s capabilities are benchmarked using \"Cursor Bench,\" an internal evaluation suite derived from real developer agent requests. The benchmark measures not just correctness, but also the model’s adherence to existing abstractions, style conventions, and engineering practices.On this benchmark, Composer achieves frontier-level coding intelligence while generating at 250 tokens per second — about twice as fast as leading fast-inference models and four times faster than comparable frontier systems.Cursor’s published comparison groups models into several categories: “Best Open” (e.g., Qwen Coder, GLM 4.6), “Fast Frontier” (Haiku 4.5, Gemini Flash 2.5), “Frontier 7/2025” (the strongest model available midyear), and “Best Frontier” (including GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5). Composer matches the intelligence of mid-frontier systems while delivering the highest recorded generation speed among all tested classes.A Model Built with Reinforcement Learning and Mixture-of-Experts ArchitectureResearch scientist Sasha Rush of Cursor provided insight into the model’s development in posts on the social network X, describing Composer as a reinforcement-learned (RL) mixture-of-experts (MoE) model:“We used RL to train a big MoE model to be really good at real-world coding, and also very fast.”Rush explained that the team co-designed both Composer and the Cursor environment to allow the model to operate efficiently at production scale:“Unlike other ML systems, you can’t abstract much from the full-scale system. We co-designed this project and Cursor together in order to allow running the agent at the necessary scale.”Composer was trained on real software engineering tasks rather than static datasets. During training, the model operated inside full codebases using a suite of production tools—including file editing, semantic search, and terminal commands—to solve complex engineering problems. Each training iteration involved solving a concrete challenge, such as producing a code edit, drafting a plan, or generating a targeted explanation.The reinforcement loop optimized both correctness and efficiency. Composer learned to make effective tool choices, use parallelism, and avoid unnecessary or speculative responses. Over time, the model developed emergent behaviors such as running unit tests, fixing linter errors, and performing multi-step code searches autonomously.This design enables Composer to work within the same runtime context as the end-user, making it more aligned with real-world coding conditions—handling version control, dependency management, and iterative testing.From Prototype to ProductionComposer’s development followed an earlier internal prototype known as Cheetah, which Cursor used to explore low-latency inference for coding tasks.“Cheetah was the v0 of this model primarily to test speed,” Rush said on X. “Our metrics say it [Composer] is the same speed, but much, much smarter.”Cheetah’s success at reducing latency helped Cursor identify speed as a key factor in developer trust and usability. Composer maintains that responsiveness while significantly improving reasoning and task generalization.Developers who used Cheetah during early testing noted that its speed changed how they worked. One user commented that it was “so fast that I can stay in the loop when working with it.” Composer retains that speed but extends capability to multi-step coding, refactoring, and testing tasks.Integration with Cursor 2.0Composer is fully integrated into Cursor 2.0, a major update to the company’s agentic development environment. The platform introduces a multi-agent interface, allowing up to eight agents to run in parallel, each in an isolated workspace using git worktrees or remote machines.Within this system, Composer can serve as one or more of those agents, performing tasks independently or collaboratively. Developers can compare multiple results from concurrent agent runs and select the best output.Cursor 2.0 also includes supporting features that enhance Composer’s effectiveness:In-Editor Browser (GA) – enables agents to run and test their code directly inside the IDE, forwarding DOM information to the model.Improved Code Review – aggregates diffs across multiple files for faster inspection of model-generated changes.Sandboxed Terminals (GA) – isolate agent-run shell commands for secure local execution.Voice Mode – adds speech-to-text controls for initiating or managing agent sessions.While these platform updates expand the overall Cursor experience, Composer is positioned as the technical core enabling fast, reliable agentic coding.Infrastructure and Training SystemsTo train Composer at scale, Cursor built a custom reinforcement learning infrastructure combining PyTorch and Ray for asynchronous training across thousands of NVIDIA GPUs. The team developed specialized MXFP8 MoE kernels and hybrid sharded data parallelism, enabling large-scale model updates with minimal communication overhead.This configuration allows Cursor to train models natively at low precision without requiring post-training quantization, improving both inference speed and efficiency. Composer’s training relied on hundreds of thousands of concurrent sandboxed environments—each a self-contained coding workspace—running in the cloud. The company adapted its Background Agents infrastructure to schedule these virtual machines dynamically, supporting the bursty nature of large RL runs.Enterprise UseComposer’s performance improvements are supported by infrastructure-level changes across Cursor’s code intelligence stack. The company has optimized its Language Server Protocols (LSPs) for faster diagnostics and navigation, especially in Python and TypeScript projects. These changes reduce latency when Composer interacts with large repositories or generates multi-file updates.Enterprise users gain administrative control over Composer and other agents through team rules, audit logs, and sandbox enforcement. Cursor’s Teams and Enterprise tiers also support pooled model usage, SAML/OIDC authentication, and analytics for monitoring agent performance across organizations.Pricing for individual users ranges from Free (Hobby) to Ultra ($200/month) tiers, with expanded usage limits for Pro+ and Ultra subscribers. Business pricing starts at $40 per user per month for Teams, with enterprise contracts offering custom usage and compliance options.Composer’s Role in the Evolving AI Coding LandscapeComposer’s focus on speed, reinforcement learning, and integration with live coding workflows differentiates it from other AI development assistants such as GitHub Copilot or Replit’s Agent. Rather than serving as a passive suggestion engine, Composer is designed for continuous, agent-driven collaboration, where multiple autonomous systems interact directly with a project’s codebase.This model-level specialization—training AI to function within the real environment it will operate in—represents a significant step toward practical, autonomous software development. Composer is not trained only on text data or static code, but within a dynamic IDE that mirrors production conditions.Rush described this approach as essential to achieving real-world reliability: the model learns not just how to generate code, but how to integrate, test, and improve it in context.What It Means for Enterprise Devs and Vibe CodingWith Composer, Cursor is introducing more than a fast model—it’s deploying an AI system optimized for real-world use, built to operate inside the same tools developers already rely on. The combination of reinforcement learning, mixture-of-experts design, and tight product integration gives Composer a practical edge in speed and responsiveness that sets it apart from general-purpose language models.While Cursor 2.0 provides the infrastructure for multi-agent collaboration, Composer is the core innovation that makes those workflows viable. It’s the first coding model built specifically for agentic, production-level coding—and an early glimpse of what everyday programming could look like when human developers and autonomous models share the same workspace.",

The jet, built by Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works, took off from US Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, California. Flown by Nils Larson, NASA’s lead test pilot for the X-59, the inaugural flight validated the jet’s airworthiness and safety before landing about an hour after takeoff near NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California. “X-59 is a symbol of American ingenuity,” acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy said in a statement. “It’s part of our DNA—the desire to go farther, faster, and even quieter than anyone has ever gone before.”Read full article Comments",

The first of the E-GMP cars was the Ioniq 5, which looks like a 1980’s hatch scaled up to the midsize crossover segment. Now made in the US, it has been a firm hit—and at the beginning of the month just got a hefty price cut, to boot. A midsized sedan followed, but these are a less common sight here given American car-buying tastes. Those tastes shaped the Ioniq 9, though. The underlying technology might hail from Hyundai’s Namyang R&D center in South Korea, but the Ioniq 9 is the result of that technology expressed through the tastes of suburban America. Not so much the exterior styling, though. The hood is too low, the corners are more rounded, and it’s generally a less-threatening shape than the average domestic three-row SUV.Read full article Comments",

In May, it emerged that former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt acquired Relativity Space due to his interest in space-based data centers. Then, earlier this month, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos predicted that gigawatt-scale data centers will be built in space within the next 10 to 20 years. Now, Elon Musk, whose SpaceX owns and operates significantly more space-based infrastructure than any other company or country in the world, has also expressed interest in the technology.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "2017 feels like another era these days, but if you cast your mind back that far, you might remember Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s vaporware Roadster 2.0. Full of nonsensical-sounding features that impressed people who know a little bit about rockets but nothing about cars, the $200,000 electric car promised to have a suction fan and “cold gas thrusters,” plus 620 miles (1,000 km) of range and a whole load of other stuff that’s never happening. Plenty of other electric automakers have introduced electric hypercars in the eight years since Musk declared the second Roadster a thing, with no sign of it being any closer to reality, if the latest job postings are accurate. And it seems that over time, a lot of the people who gave the company a hefty deposit—some say interest-free loan—have become tired of waiting and want their money back. And that’s not quite so easy, it turns out. Musk’s current Silicon Valley rival is the latest to discover this. According to Sam Altman’s social media account, he placed an order for a Roadster on July 11, 2018, with a deposit of $45,000 ($58,206 in today’s money). But after emailing Tesla for a refund, he discovered the email address associated with preorders had been deleted.Read full article Comments",

While it’s clear that both AT&T and T-Mobile have a history of misleading ad campaigns, AT&T portrays itself as a paragon of honesty in new ads calling T-Mobile “the master of breaking promises.” An AT&T press release about the ad campaign said the NAD “asked T-Mobile to correct their marketing claims 16 times over the last four years,” and an AT&T commercial said T-Mobile has faced more challenges for deceptive ads from competitors than all other telecom providers in that time.Read full article Comments",

But what do you do when the misbehaving app is the Task Manager itself? After a recent Windows update, some users (including Windows Latest) noticed that closing the Task Manager window was actually failing to close the app, leaving the executable running in memory. More worryingly, each time you open the Task Manager, it spawns a new process on top of the old one, which you can repeat essentially infinitely (or until your PC buckles under the pressure). Each instance of Task Manager takes up around 20MB of system RAM and hovers between 0 and 2 percent CPU usage—if you have just a handful of instances open, it’s unlikely that you’d notice much of a performance impact. But if you use Task Manager frequently or just go a long time between reboots, opening up two or three dozen copies of the process that are all intermittently using a fraction of your CPU can add up, leading to a potentially significant impact on performance and battery life.Read full article Comments",

The pair of artifacts, unearthed from layers 47,000 and 46,000 years old, showed signs of being deliberately shaped into crayons and resharpened over time. A third piece of ocher had been carefully carved with parallel lines. The finds add to the growing body of evidence that Neanderthals had an artistic streak. This piece of yellow ocher was used as a crayon and resharpened before finally being worn blunt and discarded. Credit: D'Errico et al. 2025 Please pass Og the yellow crayon Rock shelters, occupied by Neanderthals between 100,000 and 33,000 years ago, dot the landscape near the modern city of Bilohirsk in Crimea (a peninsula in southern Ukraine). Archaeologists studying those rock shelters have unearthed dozens of chunks of an iron-rich mineral called ocher. Many of them have flakes knocked out or grooves gouged into their surface, which mark how Neanderthals extracted powdery red, orange, or yellow pigment from the stone. D’Errico and his colleagues used X-ray fluorescence and scanning electron microscopes to examine 16 ocher chunks to better understand exactly what ancient Crimean Neanderthals were doing with the stuff. Most of those ocher chunks could have been used for nearly anything. Ocher is handy not just as a pigment but also for tanning animal hides, mixing with resins into adhesives for hafting tools, or even repelling insects and preventing infection. Knapping a few flakes off a hard nodule of ocher, then crushing them into powder (or just carving out a chunk of a softer, more crumbly piece), is a good way to prepare it for any of those uses. But two pieces, both from a site called Zaskalnaya V, were clearly different.Read full article Comments",

Casey Means, President Trump’s nominee for surgeon general, was scheduled to appear virtually at a Senate confirmation hearing today, but the hearing was postponed indefinitely after she went into labor. The hearing, it turns out, had been scheduled two days after her due date, CNN reported this morning. Meanwhile, The New York Times separately reported that Calley Means has departed from the White House, vacating his role as a “Special Government Employee,” which has a 130-day term limit. The Times reported that Calley left about a month ago when the term ended, though the White House never announced his departure, and he has continued to be identified as a government employee in press articles and at a conference. Calley, who has acted as an influential advisor to anti-vaccine health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., told the Times that the press articles and his conference biography were inaccurate.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Despite being a vast repository of personal information, smartphones used to have little by way of security. That has thankfully changed, but companies like Cellebrite offer law enforcement tools that can bypass security on some devices. The company keeps the specifics quiet, but an anonymous individual recently logged in to a Cellebrite briefing and came away with a list of which of Google’s Pixel phones are vulnerable to Cellebrite phone hacking. This person, who goes by the handle rogueFed, posted screenshots from the recent Microsoft Teams meeting to the GrapheneOS forums (spotted by 404 Media). GrapheneOS is an Android-based operating system that can be installed on select phones, including Pixels. It ships with enhanced security features and no Google services. Because of its popularity among the security-conscious, Cellebrite apparently felt the need to include it in its matrix of Pixel phone support. The screenshot includes data on the Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, and Pixel 9 family. It does not list the Pixel 10 series, which launched just a few months ago. The phone support is split up into three different conditions: before first unlock, after first unlock, and unlocked. The before first unlock (BFU) state means the phone has not been unlocked since restarting, so all data is encrypted. This is traditionally the most secure state for a phone. In the after first unlock (AFU) state, data extraction is easier. And naturally, an unlocked phone is open season on your data.Read full article Comments",

However, news of the potential IPO comes as the company faces mounting losses that may have reached as much as $11.5 billion in the most recent quarter, according to one estimate. Going public could give OpenAI more efficient access to capital and enable larger acquisitions using public stock, helping finance Altman’s plans to spend trillions of dollars on AI infrastructure, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking who spoke with Reuters. Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar has reportedly told some associates the company targets a 2027 IPO listing, while some financial advisors predict 2026 could be possible. Three people with knowledge of the plans told Reuters that OpenAI has discussed raising $60 billion at the low end in preliminary talks. That figure refers to how much money the company would raise by selling shares to investors, not the total worth of the company. If OpenAI sold that amount of stock while keeping most shares private, the entire company could be valued at $1 trillion or more. The final figures and timing will likely change based on business growth and market conditions.Read full article Comments",

Having lost the antitrust case brought by Epic Games, Google has implemented the first phase of changes mandated by the court. Developers operating in the Play Store will have more freedom to direct app users to resources outside the Google bubble. However, Google has not given up hope of reversing its loss before it’s forced to make bigger changes. Epic began pursuing this case in 2020, stemming from its attempt to sell Fortnite content without going through Google’s payment system. It filed a similar case against Apple, but the company fell short there because it could not show that Apple put its thumb on the scale. Google, however, engaged in conduct that amounted to suppressing the development of alternative Android app stores. It lost the case and came up short on appeal this past summer, leaving the company with little choice but to prepare for the worst. Google has updated its support pages to confirm that it’s abiding by the court’s order. In the US, Play Store developers now have the option of using external payment platforms that bypass the Play Store entirely. This could hypothetically allow developers to offer lower prices, as they don’t have to pay Google’s commission, which can be up to 30 percent. Devs will also be permitted to direct users to sources for app downloads and payment methods outside the Play Store.Read full article Comments",

And how would Affinity’s strong stance against generative AI be reconciled with Canva’s embrace of those technologies. This week, Canva gave us definitive answers to all of those questions: a brand-new unified Affinity app that melds the Photo, Designer, and Publisher apps into a single piece of software called “Affinity by Canva” that is free to use with a Canva user account, but which gates generative AI features behind Canva’s existing paid subscription plans ($120 a year for individuals). This does seem like mostly good news, in the near to mid term, for existing Affinity app users who admired Affinity’s anti-AI stance: All three apps’ core features are free to use, and the stuff you’re being asked to pay for is stuff you mostly don’t want anyway. But it may come as unwelcome news for those who like the predictability of pay-once-own-forever software or are nervous about where Canva might draw the line between “free” and “premium” features down the line.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "For four decades, a frequently acrimonious debate has raged in paleontological circles about the correct taxonomy for a handful of rare fossil specimens. One faction insisted the fossils were juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex; the other argued that they represented a new species dubbed Nanotyrannus lancensis. Now, paleontologists believe they have settled the debate once and for all due to a new analysis of a well-preserved fossil. The verdict: It is indeed a new species, according to a new paper published in the journal Nature. The authors also reclassified another specimen as a second new species, distinct from N. lancensis. In short, Nanotyrannus is a valid taxon and contains two species. “This fossil doesn’t just settle the debate,” said Lindsay Zanno, a paleontologist at North Carolina State University and head of paleontology at North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. “It flips decades of T. rex research on its head.” That’s because paleontologists have relied on such fossils to model the growth and behavior of T. rex. The new findings suggest that there could have been multiple tyrannosaur species and that paleontologists have been underestimating the diversity of dinosaurs from this period.Read full article Comments",
