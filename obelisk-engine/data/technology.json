          "standfirst": "AMD is kicking off CES 2026 on Monday, where it'll cover its latest AI developments and perhaps show off its newest Ryzen chips. The company will outline the full scope of its vision for AI implementations across the full spectrum of consumer and enterprise applications. The presentation — which is the lead keynote for CES 2026 — will be led by CEO Dr. Lisa Su. We'll tell you how to tune in to the livestream and what else you can expect to see. How to watch AMD's keynote live Dr. Su will deliver a keynote speech from the Palazzo Ballroom at the Venetian on Monday, January 5 at 9:30PM ET (6:30PM PT). You can watch the event live on the CES YouTube channel (we've embedded the livestream below). What to expect While AMD says it's keeping its product details under wraps, we can expect \"updates on AI solutions, from cloud to enterprise, edge and devices.\" It's also likely that AMD will unveil its new versions of the Ryzen chips during its keynote on Monday, as Su will talk about the \"advancements driven by Ryzen CPUs.\" That could include the Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to have better single-threaded performance. Additionally, we can expect to see the Ryzen 9000G series, which is potentially built with AMD's Zen 5 architecture. Regarding AI, AMD could further discuss its new FSR Redstone technology, which it previously previewed on December 10. AMD's upscaling tech aims to close the gap on NVIDIA's DLSS 4, which was announced during CES 2025. Su's presentation caps off CES's press day, so she'll be taking the stage in the hours after rivals NVIDIA and Intel present their chipmaking and AI plans to the world. As a reminder of how cross-linked these companies have become: OpenAI has pledged billions of dollars of hardware orders to AMD, while rival NVIDIA has invested billions in OpenAI — and taken a stake worth billions in Intel, too.

Sound odd? That's because the traditional end-of-press-day slot isn't just Sony, but rather Sony Honda Mobility — the joint venture responsible for the Afeela 1 electric car that has been showcased at CES for the better part of a decade. But this year, we'll get to see an all-new concept model at the event. How to watch the Sony Afeela CES 2026 press conference The event will be streamed live from Las Vegas on Monday, January 5 at 8PM ET via the Afeela official YouTube channel, which we've embedded below. What to expect from Sony Afeela at CES The Afeela 1 has been shown in various incarnations since CES 2020, where it was originally announced as the Vision-S. But so many more important details were confirmed in the past couple of years, including the price, which starts at a staggering $89,900. However, the earlier impressions were less than impressive, and as of CES 2025, that thought remains the same. Engadget's automotive expert Tim Stevens said a year ago that the EV \"feels like a PlayStation 4 in the PS5 era,\" and that \"the car lost what little interesting styling it had while sticking true to some specifications that sounded good five years ago.\" Ouch. But the Afeela 1 won't be the only vehicle on display. Its CES booth will showcase \"several Afeela 1 pre-production vehicles in multiple color variations, alongside a new Afeela concept model,\" Sony Honda Mobility said in a press release. The company recently announced that the Afeela will be the first vehicle ever to offer PlayStation Remote Play, which lets players stream their PS4 or PS5 games from their consoles remotely while inside the car. That's no doubt built on the same streaming improvements that have been incorporated into the PlayStation Portal. We're hoping to hear about what else is new and improved at CES 2026, and we're also excited to see its newest concept model. And between booth displays and press releases, we're hoping we'll get to see at least a few new Sony Electronics products on the docket for 2026, too.

For this year's show, the company's website says it's \"lighting up CES 2026 with the power of AI.\" To that end, NVIDIA is going big in Las Vegas, promising hands-on demos in its Fontainebleau booth, replete with the \"latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.\" But if you won't be in Vegas for the action, don't worry. Here's how you can watch the livestream of the company's January 5 press conference, and what NVIDIA is expected to unveil at CES this year. How to watch the NVIDIA CES 2026 keynote NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a 90-minute keynote at CES 2026. The event will be livestreamed on Monday, January 5 at 4PM ET via NVIDIA's website (and likely on YouTube as well). We'll embed the link here once it's available. What to expect NVIDIA's game plan for CES is suitably vague so far, including \"cutting-edge AI, robotics, simulation, gaming and content creation at the NVIDIA Showcase.\" It also notes there will be more than 20 demos. Although we're unsure if all of these will be shown during the keynote, we can at least expect to see them throughout the week of CES. NVIDIA arrives at CES as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world (a stunning $4.6 trillion at the time of this writing, albeit down from an even higher valuation earlier in 2025). And given that the health of the US and global economy seems increasingly linked to infrastructure spending on AI data centers — largely powered by chips from NVIDIA and its competitors — expect Huang's remarks to be as closely followed by Wall Street investors as technology acolytes, if not more so. Will we get any insight on a successor to the company's Blackwell chip? A more detailed look at how NVIDIA's partners are applying AI to real-world robotics? Time will tell, but you might want to keep your stock portfolio in a split screen while taking in Huang's presentation.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-nvidia-ces-2026-press-conference-with-jensen-huang-live-130028602.html?src=rss",

The iconic toy brick maker has offered no clues about what's on the agenda, leaving speculation wide open, from new video games to Formula 1 race cars.

At CES 2025, for instance, the toy production giant partnered with Sony to announce the animated Lego Horizon Adventures online game. As such, Lego may spend some time talking up its new 2026 game, Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight. The company may also give some stage time to its Lego Group F1 Academy racing car, though that too would be more about brand building than consumer products. And given Lego's focus on the environment, the company may discuss its efforts to reach its 2032 ecological goals, including making its Lego bricks more sustainable and reducing carbon emissions by 37%. While there are plenty of new Lego sets for 2026, however, this is CES, not Toy Fair. So we're assuming that the company will be showcasing something that's more tech-centric.

And like many other tech conglomerates, the world's largest PC manufacturer by units shipped is centering its focus on AI. Lenovo says it will be a \"Tech World experience unlike anything CES has seen before.\" We'll tell you where to livestream the event and what the company has teased so far. How to watch the Lenovo CES 2026 event live Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host the event on Tuesday, January 6 at 8PM ET. You can follow along to the livestream on YouTube once the event starts. (We've embedded the code below.) What to expect Lenovo is using the high-profile Sphere venue to share some of its tie-ins to the sports world, offering an exclusive look at how the company's technology has \"revolutionized F1,\" Yang said in a press release. He'll also preview the plans for leveraging AI at this summer's FIFA World Cup, which takes place in the US. After the event has wrapped up, pop singer Gwen Stefani will take the stage to perform. As for real products, look for Lenovo to build on some of its successful launches from CES 2025. A year ago, we saw the portable Lenovo Legion Go S – the first third-party SteamOS handheld gaming device – as well as its \"stretchy\" laptop, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable that extends 2.7 inches taller with a touch of a button. To Lenovo's credit, both products were actually released and available for sale within months, unlike the vaporware that seems to comprise the bulk of many companies' CES announcements. Lastly, don't be surprised if we see some new Motorola smartphones, given that Lenovo is the parent company of the phone manufacturer. Maybe a new Razr foldable? We'll find out either way on Tuesday evening.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-lenovo-tech-world-event-at-ces-2026-130004983.html?src=rss",

Lenovo says it will be a \"Tech World experience unlike anything CES has seen before.\" We'll tell you where to livestream the event and what the company has teased so far. How to watch the Lenovo CES 2026 event live Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host the event on Tuesday, January 6 at 8PM ET. You can follow along to the livestream on YouTube once the event starts. (We've embedded the code below.) What to expect Lenovo is using the high-profile Sphere venue to share some of its tie-ins to the sports world, offering an exclusive look at how the company's technology has \"revolutionized F1,\" Yang said in a press release. He'll also preview the plans for leveraging AI at this summer's FIFA World Cup, which takes place in the US. After the event has wrapped up, pop singer Gwen Stefani will take the stage to perform. As for real products, look for Lenovo to build on some of its successful launches from CES 2025. A year ago, we saw the portable Lenovo Legion Go S – the first third-party SteamOS handheld gaming device – as well as its \"stretchy\" laptop, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable that extends 2.7 inches taller with a touch of a button. To Lenovo's credit, both products were actually released and available for sale within months, unlike the vaporware that seems to comprise the bulk of many companies' CES announcements. Lastly, don't be surprised if we see some new Motorola smartphones, given that Lenovo is the parent company of the phone manufacturer. Maybe a new Razr foldable? We'll find out either way on Tuesday evening.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-watch-the-lenovo-tech-world-event-at-ces-2026-130004983.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "AI is evolving faster than our vocabulary for describing it. We may need a few new words. We have “cognition” for how a single mind thinks, but we don&#x27;t have a word for what happens when human and machine intelligence work together to perceive, decide, create and act. Let’s call that process intelition. Intelition isn’t a feature; it’s the organizing principle for the next wave of software where humans and AI operate inside the same shared model of the enterprise. Today’s systems treat AI models as things you invoke from the outside. You act as a “user,” prompting for responses or wiring a “human in the loop” step into agentic workflows. But that&#x27;s evolving into continuous co-production: People and agents are shaping decisions, logic and actions together, in real time. Read on for a breakdown of the three forces driving this new paradigm. A unified ontology is just the beginningIn a recent shareholder letter, Palantir CEO Alex Karp wrote that “all the value in the market is going to go to chips and what we call ontology,” and argued that this shift is “only the beginning of something much larger and more significant.” By ontology, Karp means a shared model of objects (customers, policies, assets, events) and their relationships. This also includes what Palantir calls an ontology’s “kinetic layer” that defines the actions and security permissions connecting objects.In the SaaS era, every enterprise application creates its own object and process models. Combined with a host of legacy systems and often chaotic models, enterprises face the challenge of stitching all this together. It’s a big and difficult job, with redundancies, incomplete structures and missing data. The reality: No matter how many data warehouse or data lake projects commissioned, few enterprises come close to creating a consolidated enterprise ontology. A unified ontology is essential for today’s agentic AI tools. As organizations link and federate ontologies, a new software paradigm emerges: Agentic AI can reason and act across suppliers, regulators, customers and operations, not just within a single app. As Karp describes it, the aim is “to tether the power of artificial intelligence to objects and relationships in the real world.” World models and continuous learningToday’s models can hold extensive context, but holding information isn’t the same as learning from it. Continual learning requires the accumulation of understanding, rather than resets with each retraining. To his aim, Google recently announced “Nested Learning” as a potential solution, grounded direclty into existing LLM architecture and training data. The authors don’t claim to have solved the challenges of building world models. But, Nested Learning could supply the raw ingredients for them: Durable memory with continual learning layered into the system. The endpoint would make retraining obsolete. In June 2022, Meta&#x27;s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun created a blueprint for “autonomous machine intelligence” that featured a hierarchical approach to using joint embeddings to make predictions using world models. He called the technique H-JEPA, and later put bluntly: “LLMs are good at manipulating language, but not at thinking.”Over the past three years, LeCun and his colleagues at Meta have moved H-JEPA theory into practice with open source models V-JEPA and I-JEPA, which learn image and video representations of the world. The personal intelition interface The third force in this agentic, ontology-driven world is the personal interface. This puts people at the center rather than as “users” on the periphery. This is not another app; it is the primary way a person participates in the next era of work and life. Rather than treating AI as something we visit through a chat window or API cal, the personal intelition interface will be always-on, aware of our context, preferences and goals and capable of acting on our behalf across the entire federated economy. Let’s analyze how this is already coming together.In May, Jony Ive sold his AI device company io to OpenAI to accelerate a new AI device category. He noted at the time: “If you make something new, if you innovate, there will be consequences unforeseen, and some will be wonderful, and some will be harmful. While some of the less positive consequences were unintentional, I still feel responsibility. And the manifestation of that is a determination to try and be useful.” That is, getting the personal intelligence device right means more than an attractive venture opportunity. Apple is looking beyond LLMs for on-device solutions that require less processing power and result in less latency when creating AI apps to understand “user intent.” Last year, they created UI-JEPA, an innovation that moves to “on-device analysis” of what the user wants. This strikes directly at the business model of today’s digital economy, where centralized profiling of “users” transforms intent and behavior data into vast revenue streams.Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, recently noted: “The user has been reduced to a consumable product for the advertiser ... there&#x27;s still time to build machines that work for humans, and not the other way around.\" Moving user intent to the device will drive interest in a secure personal data management standard, Solid, that Berners-Lee and his colleagues have been developing since 2022. The standard is ideally suited to pair with new personal AI devices. For instance, Inrupt, Inc., a company founded by Berners-Lee, recently combined Solid with Anthropic’s MCP standard for Agentic Wallets. Personal control is more than a feature of this paradigm; it is the architectural safeguard as systems gain the ability to learn and act continuously.Ultimately, these three forces are moving and converging faster than most realize. Enterprise ontologies provide the nouns and verbs, world-model research supplies durable memory and learning and the personal interface becomes the permissioned point of control. The next software era isn&#x27;t coming. It&#x27;s already here.Brian Mulconrey is SVP at Sureify Labs.",

Though arch-rival Samsung getting the jump on its fellow Korean rival by giving its presentation the evening before, LG will be hitting the podium at breakfast time with the theme \"Innovation in Tune with You.\" As with many tech-focused events nowadays, AI is expected to serve as the unifying thread of LG's CES 2026 presentation. That said, LG — much like Apple — has its own take on the acronym, referring to it as \"Affectionate Intelligence.\" The company will share \"its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence — delivering harmonized and seamlessly connected customer experiences.\" The irony, though, is that LG has already shown its cards, thanks to a long string of pre-show press releases offering details about a litany of new products (see below). How to watch LG's CES 2026 presentation The event will stream live from Las Vegas on Monday, January 5 at 11AM ET. You've got a few options for tuning in — watch the livestream on the LG website, the LG Global X channel or the LG Global YouTube channel (embedded below). What to expect Here's what LG has already confirmed it will be showcasing at CES 2026: LG will debut its first Micro RGB TV, a display with a cutting-edge screen technology with multicolor backlights that should one-up mini LED displays. The size options are 100 inches, 86 inches and 75 inches. The company is countering Samsung's Frame TVs with its new LG Gallery TV, arriving in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes. Look for a new LG humanoid home automation robot named CLOiD to take the stage. In the audio realm, the Korean multinational will also introduce a Dolby-powered modular home audio system and a new line of its xboom speakers (developed with musician will.i.am). LG is revamping its ultralight Gram laptop line with a proprietary material it calls Aerominum. Does that leave any surprises for the CES press conference? We'll find out on January 5.

In the past, that's given Samsung free range to bow a full spectrum of products that range from phones and computers to refrigerators, AI assistants and rolling robots. But for CES 2026, the company is switching things up a bit: Instead of its longtime midday Monday press conference, the Korean giant will take the lead of the show with a Sunday night presentation. Over the past few weeks, Samsung has been dropping press releases left and right, so we know at least some of what to expect in Vegas this year. Of course, we're holding out hope that we get to hear an update on the Ballie robot — a star of previous CES presentations that ostensibly missed its previously promised 2025 release date. How to watch Samsung's \"The First Look\" presentation at CES 2026 The event will stream live from the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas on Sunday, January 4 at 10PM ET. There are several ways to tune in: you can watch via Samsung Electronic' official YouTube channel (which we've embedded below), Samsung Newsroom or via Samsung TV Plus. What to expect from Samsung at CES 2026 Keynote speaker TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung's Device eXperience (DX) Division, will discuss the company's plans for the new year and beyond, which will (of course) include \"new AI-driven customer experiences,\" the company said in a press release. In addition, we'll hear from the President and Head of the Visual Display Business, SW Yong and Executive Vice President and Head of Digital Appliances Business, Cheolgi Kim. Those two will \"share their respective business directions for the upcoming year.\" But if you're looking for more specifics, Samsung has been following its \"Advent calendar\" approach to early CES announcements, with new press releases dropping nearly every day in late December and early January. So far, we know that — like competitors LG and Hisense — the company will be offering details on a line of micro RGB TVs (replete with confirmed screen sizes of 55 to 115 inches). Also confirmed: a full line of appliances infused with what Samsung calls Bespoke AI. Samsung will also display its two newest speakers, Music Studio 5 and 7, at CES this year. Additionally, it'll debut its latest Freestyle+ portable projector. Just before the holidays, Samsung also unveiled a slew of new gaming monitors, but most impressive is the Odyssey gaming monitor. It boasts a 32-inch 6K screen and has glasses-free 3D. It's likely we could see this at CES, along with other models like the 27-inch Odyssey G6 and the Odyssey G8 models. It's possible that Samsung will share even more early CES announcements in the hours preceding its presentation. If that happens, we'll add them here!

The chip giant is expected to provide more details on its AI PC initiative and the new processors powering it: The Core Ultra Series 3 CPUs (aka Panther Lake) are made using an 18A process — that's 18 angstroms, or just under 2nm — and designed for high-end laptops and gaming devices. For Intel, the stakes at CES are higher than ever. In the past 12 months, both NVIDIA and the US government acquired ownership stakes in the company, helping nearly double the stock price by the end of the year. But that's still down over more than 20 percent since 2021, as rivals like TSMC, Qualcomm, AMD and NVIDIA have taken the leadership mantle in chip fabrication and AI hardware. How to watch Intel's launch event Senior VP of Intel's Client Computing Group Jim Johnson will kick off the launch event on Monday, January 5 at 6PM ET. A livestream will be available on the Intel Newsroom YouTube channel, which we'll post here when it's live. What to expect from Intel at CES 2026 As we noted above, Intel has publicly confirmed that it will be highlighting \"the next generation of Intel-powered PCs, edge solution, and the AI experiences enabled by the new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 Processors.\" We'll be keen to hear if the company can address the profitability concerns that have surrounded those next-gen chips since at least last summer, when published reports indicated that yields were still under 50 percent. (In response, Intel told Engadget that it felt \"very good\" about its trajectory on Panther Lake, though it didn't hit the late 2025 release date it had envisioned at the time.) Will we get any updates on that NVIDIA partnership? It's possible. But don't expect to hear anything about Intel possibly fabricating the chips for that rumored new entry-level MacBook Air. If that comes to pass, the announcement will definitely be at a time and place of Apple's choosing.

          "title": "Why “which API do I call?” is the wrong question in the LLM era",
          "standfirst": "For decades, we have adapted to software. We learned shell commands, memorized HTTP method names and wired together SDKs. Each interface assumed we would speak its language. In the 1980s, we typed &#x27;grep&#x27;, &#x27;ssh&#x27; and &#x27;ls&#x27; into a shell; by the mid-2000s, we were invoking REST endpoints like GET /users; by the 2010s, we imported SDKs (client.orders.list()) so we didn’t have to think about HTTP. But underlying each of those steps was the same premise: Expose capabilities in a structured form so others can invoke them.But now we are entering the next interface paradigm. Modern LLMs are challenging the notion that a user must choose a function or remember a method signature. Instead of “Which API do I call?” the question becomes: “What outcome am I trying to achieve?” In other words, the interface is shifting from code → to language. In this shift, Model Context Protocol (MCP) emerges as the abstraction that allows models to interpret human intent, discover capabilities and execute workflows, effectively exposing software functions not as programmers know them, but as natural-language requests.MCP is not a hype-term; multiple independent studies identify the architectural shift required for “LLM-consumable” tool invocation. One blog by Akamai engineers describes the transition from traditional APIs to “language-driven integrations” for LLMs. Another academic paper on “AI agentic workflows and enterprise APIs” talks about how enterprise API architecture must evolve to support goal-oriented agents rather than human-driven calls. In short: We are no longer merely designing APIs for code; we are designing capabilities for intent.Why does this matter for enterprises? Because enterprises are drowning in internal systems, integration sprawl and user training costs. Workers struggle not because they don’t have tools, but because they have too many tools, each with its own interface. When natural language becomes the primary interface, the barrier of “which function do I call?” disappears. One recent business blog observed that natural‐language interfaces (NLIs) are enabling self-serve data access for marketers who previously had to wait for analysts to write SQL. When the user just states intent (like “fetch last quarter revenue for region X and flag anomalies”), the system underneath can translate that into calls, orchestration, context memory and deliver results. Natural language becomes not a convenience, but the interfaceTo understand how this evolution works, consider the interface ladder:EraInterfaceWho it was built forCLIShell commandsExpert users typing textAPIWeb or RPC endpointsDevelopers integrating systemsSDKLibrary functionsProgrammers using abstractionsNatural language (MCP)Intent-based requestsHuman + AI agents stating what they wantThrough each step, humans had to “learn the machine’s language.” With MCP, the machine absorbs the human’s language and works out the rest. That’s not just UX improvement, it’s an architectural shift.Under MCP, functions of code are still there: data access, business logic and orchestration. But they’re discovered rather than invoked manually. For example, rather than calling \"billingApi.fetchInvoices(customerId=…),\" you say “Show all invoices for Acme Corp since January and highlight any late payments.” The model resolves the entities, calls the right systems, filters and returns structured insight. The developer’s work shifts from wiring endpoints to defining capability surfaces and guardrails.This shift transforms developer experience and enterprise integration. Teams often struggle to onboard new tools because they require mapping schemas, writing glue code and training users. With a natural-language front, onboarding involves defining business entity names, declaring capabilities and exposing them via the protocol. The human (or AI agent) no longer needs to know parameter names or call order. Studies show that using LLMs as interfaces to APIs can reduce the time and resources required to develop chatbots or tool-invoked workflows.The change also brings productivity benefits. Enterprises that adopt LLM-driven interfaces can turn data access latency (hours/days) into conversation latency (seconds). For instance, if an analyst previously had to export CSVs, run transforms and deploy slides, a language interface allows “Summarize the top five risk factors for churn over the last quarter” and generate narrative + visuals in one go. The human then reviews, adjusts and acts — shifting from data plumber to decision maker. That matters: According to a survey by McKinsey & Company, 63% of organizations using gen AI are already creating text outputs, and more than one-third are generating images or code. (While many are still in the early days of capturing enterprise-wide ROI, the signal is clear: Language as interface unlocks new value.In architectural terms, this means software design must evolve. MCP demands systems that publish capability metadata, support semantic routing, maintain context memory and enforce guardrails. An API design no longer needs to ask “What function will the user call?”, but rather “What intent might the user express?” A recently published framework for improving enterprise APIs for LLMs shows how APIs can be enriched with natural-language-friendly metadata so that agents can select tools dynamically. The implication: Software becomes modular around intent surfaces rather than function surfaces.Language-first systems also bring risks and requirements. Natural language is ambiguous by nature, so enterprises must implement authentication, logging, provenance and access control, just as they did for APIs. Without these guardrails, an agent might call the wrong system, expose data or misinterpret intent. One post on “prompt collapse” calls out the danger: As natural-language UI becomes dominant, software may turn into “a capability accessed through conversation” and the company into “an API with a natural-language frontend”. That transformation is powerful, but only safe if systems are designed for introspection, audit and governance.The shift also has cultural and organizational ramifications. For decades, enterprises hired integration engineers to design APIs and middleware. With MCP-driven models, companies will increasingly hire ontology engineers, capability architects and agent enablement specialists. These roles focus on defining the semantics of business operations, mapping business entities to system capabilities and curating context memory. Because the interface is now human-centric, skills such as domain knowledge, prompt framing, oversight and evaluation become central.What should enterprise leaders do today? First, think of natural language as the interface layer, not as a fancy add-on. Map your business workflows that can safely be invoked via language. Then catalogue the underlying capabilities you already have: data services, analytics and APIs. Then ask: “Are these discoverable? Can they be called via intent?” Finally, pilot an MCP-style layer: Build a small domain (customer support triage) where a user or agent can express outcomes in language, and let systems do the orchestration. Then iterate and scale.Natural language is not just the new front-end. It is becoming the default interface layer for software, replacing CLI, then APIs, then SDKs. MCP is the abstraction that makes this possible. Benefits include faster integration, modular systems, higher productivity and new roles. For those organizations still tethered to calling endpoints manually, the shift will feel like learning a new platform all over again.

Sure, the Afeela electric vehicle from the Sony-Honda joint venture is returning to the show floor, but with the Trump administration yanking most EV incentives from the market, the industry isn't offering a full-court press of new vehicles in Las Vegas this year. That said, there's no shortage of in-cabin car tech on display, including Hyundai's Holographic Windshield Display. Indeed, the company's Mobis subsidiary will present \"more than 30 mobility convergence technologies\" during CES. And we'll also get to see Hyundai's AI Robotics Strategy, which will showcase its new Atlas robot fresh out of the lab. How to watch Hyundai's presentation at CES 2026 Hyundai's presentation takes place on January 5 at 4PM ET, and you can livestream it on either its HyundaiUSA YouTube channel or its global YouTube channel. We'll embed the stream here once it's available. What to expect As mentioned above, Hyundai will have its Holographic Windshield Display for viewing. It's essentially a next-gen heads-up display that projects key data from the vehicle's dash on the windshield for less distraction, and without obstructing the driver's view. It's a vertically expandable 18.1-inch large display, and passengers can even watch videos without being visible to the driver. Hyundai Mobis collaborated with German optics specialist Zeiss to develop the \"world's first system to utilize holographic film to transform the entire front windshield into an ultra-large display surface.\" It says it will begin mass production in 2029, so don't expect to see this on the market anytime soon. Beyond automotive, though, we'll also get a first-ever look at the company's new Atlas robot. In the teaser image shown in the press release, Atlas looks rather dog-like, which makes sense when you remember that Boston Dynamics was purchased by the Korean multinational back in 2020. \"This next-generation Atlas represents a tangible step toward the commercialization of AI Robotics, highlighting the Group’s commitment to building safe and adaptable robotic co-workers,\" the company said in the same press release. Hyundai said it will also discuss its other tech areas, including electronics and chassis system safety, as well as an AR head-up display, low-power display solutions and EV drive systems.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/how-to-watch-the-hyundai-ces-2026-presentation-live-190051072.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "The new year is upon us, and that means CES 2026 is imminent. The biggest tech trade show of the calendar comes with a bevy of new and notable announcements that set the tone for trends and expectations for the subsequent 12 months. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, but the fun kicks off with events on Sunday January 4, followed by a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.More specific details and pre-announcements are already trickling out as CES approaches, and thanks to the schedule of the Consumer Technology Association (the trade organization that runs the show) we have a full itinerary of press conferences. We’re also using our experience and expertise to predict what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.The CES 2026 schedulePress conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The CTA has already published a searchable directory of who will have an official presence at the show, along with a schedule of every official panel and presentation. However, the press conference schedule gives us a more digestible rundown of the first 48 hours of big events. On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with \"The First Look,\" a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung's DX Division, on the company's \"vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences.\" Ahead of that, though, Samsung has already outlined a variety of more specifics (scroll down for details). Concurrent with the Samsung presentation will be the official CES Unveiled mini-show, which is generally comprised of smaller and start-up vendors. That'll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. The LG CES 2026 press conference, titled \"Innovation in Tune with You,\" is ostensibly to share \"its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence.\" But, like Samsung, this fellow Korean giant has already spent the three weeks leading up to CES pre-announcing many of its new products, so this may be more of a summary than breaking news. Following LG, we’ll also see press conferences from Bosch and Hisense, as well as the first-ever CES appearance from Lego. As the Las Vegas afternoon rolls around, we get the first of three chip giants: NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang takes the stage on January 5 at 1PM PT (4PM ET) and, according to the website, his presentation will last about 90 minutes. Based on the description on the listing, the presentation will “showcase the latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.” NVIDIA’s presser is concurrent with one from Hyundai, where the Korean automotive company will focus on in-cabin car tech and robotics. Later in the day, we get to hear from NVIDIA frenemies Intel and AMD. Intel’s 3PM PT (6PM PT) event will ostensibly feature its new Core Ultra Series 3 processors, and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD's upcoming chip announcements at a keynote address that closes out the day. But expect both of them to be very heavy on AI applications, of course. Sandwiched in between those chip manufacturers will be Sony Honda Mobility. The joint venture will be offering yet more details on its Afeela EV. Finally, on Tuesday, January 6, Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host Lenovo's Tech World Conference at the Las Vegas Sphere, using the large and decidedly curved screen to share the company's \"commitment to delivering smarter AI for all by constantly redefining how technology can engage, inspire, and empower.\" It’s worth noting that Lenovo is the parent company of Motorola, which still makes phones and foldables that feature AI tools, so it’s possible those devices feature in the presentation as well. Samsung and LG vie for pre-show publicityAs noted above, both Samsung and LG have continued their recent trend of spoiling nearly all of their respective CES announcements in the days and weeks before the show. LG, for example, has said it will debut its first Micro RGB television at CES. While details are scarce, the company’s press release for the LG Micro RGB evo did confirm it has received certifications by Intertek for 100 percent color gamut coverage in DCI-P3 an Adobe RGB, and that it has more than a thousand dimming zones for brightness control. Elsewhere in the TV space, LG is throwing its hat into the “art TV” ring that Samsung pioneered with its Frame TVs: The LG Gallery TV will debut in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and it will of course show off various artwork when it’s not otherwise in use. And if PC gaming displays are more your speed, LG will have that covered, too, with a new line of 5K-capable gaming monitors on deck with built-in AI upscaling.But LG’s not just showing off displays. The Korean multinational will also introduce a Dolby-powered modular home audio system, a new line of its xboom speakers (developed with will.i.am) and the company will flex its automation muscles with a humanoid home automation robot named CLOiD. We’re also looking forward to checking out the company’s new ultralight Aerominum laptops.Of course, Samsung refuses to be outdone by its hometown rival, and has also released a pre-CES press release document dump. Samsung will be launching its own lineup of Micro RGB TVs at CES, for starters. The company already introduced its first Micro RGB TV at CES 2025, which was a 115-inch model available for a cool $30,000. Next year, Samsung is expanding the range with 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models that use the next evolution of the company’s Micro RGB technology. Samsung is also countering LG’s 5K monitors with a 6K model that aims to deliver glasses-free 3D (another long-time CES staple). It’ll be one of several new displays in the company’s Odyssey gaming line. And the company is also updating its Freestyle projector for 2026, too. And on the audio front, Samsung has teased several new soundbars and speakers, including Sonos-style Wi-Fi streaming models call the Music Studio 5 and Studio 7.Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.New chips from AMD, Intel and QualcommCES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the Ryzen 9000G series, which could be built with AMD's Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new FSR Redstone AI upscaling tech.Intel has already publicly announced that it'll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel's overall \"AI PC\" push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops. Based on a preview from October 2025, Intel says the first chip made with its 2-nanometer 18A process will offer 50 percent more processing performance than previous generations and for the chip's Arc GPU, a 50 percent performance bump from last generation.Qualcomm is also rumored to be targeting laptops at the show, building on the work it's done moving its Snapdragon chips out of phones and tablets and into other types of computers. The company's Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Premium chips should start appearing in laptops at CES 2026, offering a look at the improved speed and AI performance the company promised in 2025.Brighter, \"truer\" screensAs noted above, Samsung and LG appear to be going all-in on Micro RGB display tech for TVs. Expect that to be a huge buzzword at CES, with Hisense and Sony debuting new models, too.Sony announced a collection of new Bravia TVs in April 2025, replacing the company's flagship, filling in its midrange options and adding a new budget model to the mix. The star of this updated Bravia lineup is the Bravia 9, which features a QD-OLED panel, but Sony appears to be prepping entirely new display tech for 2026. In March 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights colored in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony's \"General RGB LED Backlight Technology\" can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED's problems with burn-in. The company has already trademarked the name \"True RGB,\" which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES. It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn't introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.Sony isn't the only company hyped on bright screens. Samsung is reportedly pushing an updated version of the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards that could be ready to demo at CES 2026. The new HDR10+ Advanced standard would be Samsung's answer to Dolby Vision 2, which includes support for things bi-directional tone mapping and intelligent features that automatically adapt sports and gaming content. Samsung's take will reportedly offer improved brightness, genre-based tone mapping and intelligent motion smoothing options, among other improvements.And maybe your future TV won’t need a power cord, either: Displace will be showing off a mounting option that includes a 15,000mAh battery to juice up whatever giant TV screen you choose to attach.Ballie Watch 2026The ball-shaped yellow robot lovingly known as \"Ballie\" has been announced twice, first in 2020 and then again in 2024 with a projector in tow. Samsung said Ballie would go on sale in 2025 at CES last year and then shared in April 2025 that Ballie would ship this summer with Google's Gemini onboard. But it's nearly 2026, and Ballie is nowhere to be seen. It's possible Samsung could make a third attempt at announcing its robot at CES 2026, but whether or not it does, robotics will still be a big part of the show.Robot vacuums and mops were a major highlight of CES 2025, and it's safe to expect notable improvements from the new models that are announced at CES 2026. Not every company will adopt the retractable arm of the Roborock Saros Z70, but robot vacuums with legs for rising over small ledges like the Dreame X50 seem like they could become the norm. Roborock could also show off its new Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow, the first of its robot vacuums to feature a retractable roller mop.Beyond just traversing spaces more efficiently, improving robots' navigation could also be a major concern at the show. Prominent members of the AI industry are turning their attention from large language models to world models, which aim to give AI a deep understanding of physical space. Those world models could be the key to making robots — like LG’s aforementioned CLOiD — competent at navigating homes and workplaces, and will likely be a significant talking point at CES 2026.We’ll be updating this article throughout the month as more rumors surface and new products are confirmed — stay tuned for future updates!Update, December 11 2025, 11:03AM ET: This story has been updated to include detail on Lenovo being Motorola’s parent company and how the latter might have a part in the Tuesday presentation.Update, December 16 2025, 1:33PM ET: This story has been updated to include the NVIDIA press conference, which was added to the CTA schedule within the last two days.Update, December 23 2025, 7:28AM ET: This story has been updated to include LG and Samsung’s Micro RGB TV announcements, which were made public in the past seven days.

          "content": "The new year is upon us, and that means CES 2026 is imminent. The biggest tech trade show of the calendar comes with a bevy of new and notable announcements that set the tone for trends and expectations for the subsequent 12 months. The CES 2026 show floor is officially open from January 6 through 9, but the fun kicks off with events on Sunday January 4, followed by a host of press conferences on Monday. As always, product demos, announcements and networking will be happening at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other hotels all over the city. As usual, Engadget will be covering the event in-person and remotely, bringing you news and hands-ons straight from the show floor.More specific details and pre-announcements are already trickling out as CES approaches, and thanks to the schedule of the Consumer Technology Association (the trade organization that runs the show) we have a full itinerary of press conferences. We’re also using our experience and expertise to predict what tech trends could rear their heads at the show.The CES 2026 schedulePress conferences and show floor booths are the bread and butter of CES. The CTA has already published a searchable directory of who will have an official presence at the show, along with a schedule of every official panel and presentation. However, the press conference schedule gives us a more digestible rundown of the first 48 hours of big events. On Sunday, January 4, Samsung will kick-off CES with \"The First Look,\" a presentation hosted by TM Roh, the CEO of Samsung's DX Division, on the company's \"vision for the DX (Device eXperience) Division in 2026, along with new AI-driven customer experiences.\" Ahead of that, though, Samsung has already outlined a variety of more specifics (scroll down for details). Concurrent with the Samsung presentation will be the official CES Unveiled mini-show, which is generally comprised of smaller and start-up vendors. That'll be followed by multiple press conferences throughout Monday, January 5. The LG CES 2026 press conference, titled \"Innovation in Tune with You,\" is ostensibly to share \"its vision for elevating daily life through Affectionate Intelligence.\" But, like Samsung, this fellow Korean giant has already spent the three weeks leading up to CES pre-announcing many of its new products, so this may be more of a summary than breaking news. Following LG, we’ll also see press conferences from Bosch and Hisense, as well as the first-ever CES appearance from Lego. As the Las Vegas afternoon rolls around, we get the first of three chip giants: NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang takes the stage on January 5 at 1PM PT (4PM ET) and, according to the website, his presentation will last about 90 minutes. Based on the description on the listing, the presentation will “showcase the latest NVIDIA solutions driving innovation and productivity across industries.” NVIDIA’s presser is concurrent with one from Hyundai, where the Korean automotive company will focus on in-cabin car tech and robotics. Later in the day, we get to hear from NVIDIA frenemies Intel and AMD. Intel’s 3PM PT (6PM PT) event will ostensibly feature its new Core Ultra Series 3 processors, and AMD CEO Lisa Su will cover AMD's upcoming chip announcements at a keynote address that closes out the day. But expect both of them to be very heavy on AI applications, of course. Sandwiched in between those chip manufacturers will be Sony Honda Mobility. The joint venture will be offering yet more details on its Afeela EV. Finally, on Tuesday, January 6, Lenovo CEO Yuanqing Yang will host Lenovo's Tech World Conference at the Las Vegas Sphere, using the large and decidedly curved screen to share the company's \"commitment to delivering smarter AI for all by constantly redefining how technology can engage, inspire, and empower.\" It’s worth noting that Lenovo is the parent company of Motorola, which still makes phones and foldables that feature AI tools, so it’s possible those devices feature in the presentation as well. Samsung and LG vie for pre-show publicityAs noted above, both Samsung and LG have continued their recent trend of spoiling nearly all of their respective CES announcements in the days and weeks before the show. LG, for example, has said it will debut its first Micro RGB television at CES. While details are scarce, the company’s press release for the LG Micro RGB evo did confirm it has received certifications by Intertek for 100 percent color gamut coverage in DCI-P3 an Adobe RGB, and that it has more than a thousand dimming zones for brightness control. Elsewhere in the TV space, LG is throwing its hat into the “art TV” ring that Samsung pioneered with its Frame TVs: The LG Gallery TV will debut in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and it will of course show off various artwork when it’s not otherwise in use. And if PC gaming displays are more your speed, LG will have that covered, too, with a new line of 5K-capable gaming monitors on deck with built-in AI upscaling.But LG’s not just showing off displays. The Korean multinational will also introduce a Dolby-powered modular home audio system, a new line of its xboom speakers (developed with will.i.am) and the company will flex its automation muscles with a humanoid home automation robot named CLOiD. We’re also looking forward to checking out the company’s new ultralight Aerominum laptops.Of course, Samsung refuses to be outdone by its hometown rival, and has also released a pre-CES press release document dump. Samsung will be launching its own lineup of Micro RGB TVs at CES, for starters. The company already introduced its first Micro RGB TV at CES 2025, which was a 115-inch model available for a cool $30,000. Next year, Samsung is expanding the range with 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, 100- and 115-inch models that use the next evolution of the company’s Micro RGB technology. Samsung is also countering LG’s 5K monitors with a 6K model that aims to deliver glasses-free 3D (another long-time CES staple). It’ll be one of several new displays in the company’s Odyssey gaming line. And the company is also updating its Freestyle projector for 2026, too. And on the audio front, Samsung has teased several new soundbars and speakers, including Sonos-style Wi-Fi streaming models call the Music Studio 5 and Studio 7.Outside of the formal introduction of new products and initiatives, reading the tea leaves of what was announced last year and what companies are reportedly working on, we can make some educated guesses at what we could see at CES 2026.New chips from AMD, Intel and QualcommCES is frequently the start of a cascade of new chip announcements for a given year, and one of the first places new silicon appears in real consumer products. AMD will likely use its keynote to introduce new versions of its Ryzen chips, including the recently spotted Ryzen 7 9850X3D, which is expected to offer better single-threaded performance, and the Ryzen 9000G series, which could be built with AMD's Zen 5 architecture. The company might also use its CES stage to go over its new FSR Redstone AI upscaling tech.Intel has already publicly announced that it'll launch its Panther Lake chips at CES 2026. The officially titled Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips fit into Intel's overall \"AI PC\" push, but are specifically meant for premium laptops. Based on a preview from October 2025, Intel says the first chip made with its 2-nanometer 18A process will offer 50 percent more processing performance than previous generations and for the chip's Arc GPU, a 50 percent performance bump from last generation.Qualcomm is also rumored to be targeting laptops at the show, building on the work it's done moving its Snapdragon chips out of phones and tablets and into other types of computers. The company's Snapdragon X2 Elite and X2 Elite Premium chips should start appearing in laptops at CES 2026, offering a look at the improved speed and AI performance the company promised in 2025.Brighter, \"truer\" screensAs noted above, Samsung and LG appear to be going all-in on Micro RGB display tech for TVs. Expect that to be a huge buzzword at CES, with Hisense and Sony debuting new models, too.Sony announced a collection of new Bravia TVs in April 2025, replacing the company's flagship, filling in its midrange options and adding a new budget model to the mix. The star of this updated Bravia lineup is the Bravia 9, which features a QD-OLED panel, but Sony appears to be prepping entirely new display tech for 2026. In March 2025, Sony introduced a new RGB LED panel that uses individual Mini LED backlights colored in red, green and blue to produce even brighter, more accurate colors. In contrast to a QD-OLED, which filters a layer of blue organic light emitting diodes through quantum dots that change color, Sony's \"General RGB LED Backlight Technology\" can get as bright as a Mini LED panel without needing an extra filter layer or worrying about OLED's problems with burn-in. The company has already trademarked the name \"True RGB,\" which could end up being what Sony calls this new flavor of display if it decides to show them off at CES. It seems entirely likely, because CES is nothing if not a TV show — it’s a sure bet that we’ll see new TVs from the likes of LG and Samsung in addition to Sony. If the company doesn't introduce new display tech for its TVs, it does have a new 240Hz PlayStation monitor coming in 2026 that it could show off at CES instead.Sony isn't the only company hyped on bright screens. Samsung is reportedly pushing an updated version of the HDR10 and HDR10+ standards that could be ready to demo at CES 2026. The new HDR10+ Advanced standard would be Samsung's answer to Dolby Vision 2, which includes support for things bi-directional tone mapping and intelligent features that automatically adapt sports and gaming content. Samsung's take will reportedly offer improved brightness, genre-based tone mapping and intelligent motion smoothing options, among other improvements.And maybe your future TV won’t need a power cord, either: Displace will be showing off a mounting option that includes a 15,000mAh battery to juice up whatever giant TV screen you choose to attach.Ballie Watch 2026The ball-shaped yellow robot lovingly known as \"Ballie\" has been announced twice, first in 2020 and then again in 2024 with a projector in tow. Samsung said Ballie would go on sale in 2025 at CES last year and then shared in April 2025 that Ballie would ship this summer with Google's Gemini onboard. But it's nearly 2026, and Ballie is nowhere to be seen. It's possible Samsung could make a third attempt at announcing its robot at CES 2026, but whether or not it does, robotics will still be a big part of the show.Robot vacuums and mops were a major highlight of CES 2025, and it's safe to expect notable improvements from the new models that are announced at CES 2026. Not every company will adopt the retractable arm of the Roborock Saros Z70, but robot vacuums with legs for rising over small ledges like the Dreame X50 seem like they could become the norm. Roborock could also show off its new Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow, the first of its robot vacuums to feature a retractable roller mop.Beyond just traversing spaces more efficiently, improving robots' navigation could also be a major concern at the show. Prominent members of the AI industry are turning their attention from large language models to world models, which aim to give AI a deep understanding of physical space. Those world models could be the key to making robots — like LG’s aforementioned CLOiD — competent at navigating homes and workplaces, and will likely be a significant talking point at CES 2026.We’ll be updating this article throughout the month as more rumors surface and new products are confirmed — stay tuned for future updates!Update, December 11 2025, 11:03AM ET: This story has been updated to include detail on Lenovo being Motorola’s parent company and how the latter might have a part in the Tuesday presentation.Update, December 16 2025, 1:33PM ET: This story has been updated to include the NVIDIA press conference, which was added to the CTA schedule within the last two days.Update, December 23 2025, 7:28AM ET: This story has been updated to include LG and Samsung’s Micro RGB TV announcements, which were made public in the past seven days.

          "standfirst": "Nvidia’s $20 billion strategic licensing deal with Groq represents one of the first clear moves in a four-front fight over the future AI stack. 2026 is when that fight becomes obvious to enterprise builders.For the technical decision-makers we talk to every day — the people building the AI applications and the data pipelines that drive them — this deal is a signal that the era of the one-size-fits-all GPU as the default AI inference answer is ending.We are entering the age of the disaggregated inference architecture, where the silicon itself is being split into two different types to accommodate a world that demands both massive context and instantaneous reasoning.Why inference is breaking the GPU architecture in twoTo understand why Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dropped one-third of his reported $60 billion cash pile on a licensing deal, you have to look at the existential threats converging on his company’s reported 92% market share. The industry reached a tipping point in late 2025: For the first time, inference — the phase where trained models actually run — surpassed training in terms of total data center revenue, according to Deloitte. In this new \"Inference Flip,\" the metrics have changed. While accuracy remains the baseline, the battle is now being fought over latency and the ability to maintain \"state\" in autonomous agents.There are four fronts of that battle, and each front points to the same conclusion: Inference workloads are fragmenting faster than GPUs can generalize. 1. Breaking the GPU in two: Prefill vs. decodeGavin Baker, an investor in Groq (and therefore biased, but also unusually fluent on the architecture), summarized the core driver of the Groq deal cleanly: “Inference is disaggregating into prefill and decode.”Prefill and decode are two distinct phases:The prefill phase: Think of this as the user’s \"prompt\" stage. The model must ingest massive amounts of data — whether it&#x27;s a 100,000-line codebase or an hour of video — and compute a contextual understanding. This is \"compute-bound,\" requiring massive matrix multiplication that Nvidia’s GPUs are historically excellent at.The generation (decode) phase: This is the actual token-by-token \"generation.” Once the prompt is ingested, the model generates one word (or token) at a time, feeding each one back into the system to predict the next. This is \"memory-bandwidth bound.\" If the data can&#x27;t move from the memory to the processor fast enough, the model stutters, no matter how powerful the GPU is. (This is where Nvidia was weak, and where Groq’s special language processing unit (LPU) and its related SRAM memory, shines. More on that in a bit.)Nvidia has announced an upcoming Vera Rubin family of chips that it’s architecting specifically to handle this split. The Rubin CPX component of this family is the designated \"prefill\" workhorse, optimized for massive context windows of 1 million tokens or more. To handle this scale affordably, it moves away from the eye-watering expense of high bandwidth memory (HBM) — Nvidia’s current gold-standard memory that sits right next to the GPU die — and instead utilizes 128GB of a new kind of memory, GDDR7. While HBM provides extreme speed (though not as quick as Groq’s static random-access memory (SRAM)), its supply on GPUs is limited and its cost is a barrier to scale; GDDR7 provides a more cost-effective way to ingest massive datasets.Meanwhile, the \"Groq-flavored\" silicon, which Nvidia is integrating into its inference roadmap, will serve as the high-speed \"decode\" engine. This is about neutralizing a threat from alternative architectures like Google&#x27;s TPUs and maintaining the dominance of CUDA, Nvidia’s software ecosystem that has served as its primary moat for over a decade.All of this was enough for Baker, the Groq investor, to predict that Nvidia’s move to license Groq will cause all other specialized AI chips to be canceled — that is, outside of Google’s TPU, Tesla’s AI5, and AWS’s Trainium.2. The differentiated power of SRAMAt the heart of Groq’s technology is SRAM. Unlike the DRAM found in your PC or the HBM on an Nvidia H100 GPU, SRAM is etched directly into the logic of the processor.Michael Stewart, managing partner of Microsoft’s venture fund, M12, describes SRAM as the best for moving data over short distances with minimal energy. \"The energy to move a bit in SRAM is like 0.1 picojoules or less,\" Stewart said. \"To move it between DRAM and the processor is more like 20 to 100 times worse.\"In the world of 2026, where agents must reason in real-time, SRAM acts as the ultimate \"scratchpad\": a high-speed workspace where the model can manipulate symbolic operations and complex reasoning processes without the \"wasted cycles\" of external memory shuttling.However, SRAM has a major drawback: it is physically bulky and expensive to manufacture, meaning its capacity is limited compared to DRAM. This is where Val Bercovici, chief AI officer at Weka, another company offering memory for GPUs, sees the market segmenting.Groq-friendly AI workloads — where SRAM has the advantage — are those that use small models of 8 billion parameters and below, Bercovici said. This isn’t a small market, though. “It’s just a giant market segment that was not served by Nvidia, which was edge inference, low latency, robotics, voice, IoT devices — things we want running on our phones without the cloud for convenience, performance, or privacy,\" he said.This 8B \"sweet spot\" is significant because 2025 saw an explosion in model distillation, where many enterprise companies are shrinking massive models into highly efficient smaller versions. While SRAM isn&#x27;t practical for the trillion-parameter \"frontier\" models, it is perfect for these smaller, high-velocity models.3. The Anthropic threat: The rise of the ‘portable stack’Perhaps the most under-appreciated driver of this deal is Anthropic’s success in making its stack portable across accelerators.The company has pioneered a portable engineering approach for training and inference — basically a software layer that allows its Claude models to run across multiple AI accelerator families — including Nvidia’s GPUs and Google’s Ironwood TPUs. Until recently, Nvidia&#x27;s dominance was protected because running high-performance models outside of the Nvidia stack was a technical nightmare. “It’s Anthropic,” Weka’s Bercovici told me. “The fact that Anthropic was able to … build up a software stack that could work on TPUs as well as on GPUs, I don’t think that’s being appreciated enough in the marketplace.”(Disclosure: Weka has been a sponsor of VentureBeat events.)Anthropic recently committed to accessing up to 1 million TPUs from Google, representing over a gigawatt of compute capacity. This multi-platform approach ensures the company isn&#x27;t held hostage by Nvidia&#x27;s pricing or supply constraints. So for Nvidia, the Groq deal is equally a defensive move. By integrating Groq’s ultra-fast inference IP, Nvidia is making sure that the most performance-sensitive workloads — like those running small models or as part of real-time agents — can be accommodated within Nvidia’s CUDA ecosystem, even as competitors try to jump ship to Google&#x27;s Ironwood TPUs. CUDA is the special software Nvidia provides to developers to integrate GPUs. 4. The agentic ‘statehood’ war: Manus and the KV CacheThe timing of this Groq deal coincides with Meta’s acquisition of the agent pioneer Manus just two days ago. The significance of Manus was partly its obsession with statefulness.If an agent can’t remember what it did 10 steps ago, it is useless for real-world tasks like market research or software development. KV Cache (Key-Value Cache) is the \"short-term memory\" that an LLM builds during the prefill phase.Manus reported that for production-grade agents, the ratio of input tokens to output tokens can reach 100:1. This means for every word an agent says, it is \"thinking\" and \"remembering\" 100 others. In this environment, the KV Cache hit rate is the single most important metric for a production agent, Manus said. If that cache is \"evicted\" from memory, the agent loses its train of thought, and the model must burn massive energy to recompute the prompt.Groq’s SRAM can be a \"scratchpad\" for these agents — although, again, mostly for smaller models — because it allows for the near-instant retrieval of that state. Combined with Nvidia&#x27;s Dynamo framework and the KVBM, Nvidia is building an \"inference operating system\" that enables inference servers to tier this state across SRAM, DRAM, HBM, and other flash-based offerings like that from Bercovici’s Weka.Thomas Jorgensen, senior director of Technology Enablement at Supermicro, which specializes in building clusters of GPUs for large enterprise companies, told me in September that compute is no longer the primary bottleneck for advanced clusters. Feeding data to GPUs was the bottleneck, and breaking that bottleneck requires memory.\"The whole cluster is now the computer,\" Jorgensen said. \"Networking becomes an internal part of the beast … feeding the beast with data is becoming harder because the bandwidth between GPUs is growing faster than anything else.\"This is why Nvidia is pushing into disaggregated inference. By separating the workloads, enterprise applications can use specialized storage tiers to feed data at memory-class performance, while the specialized \"Groq-inside\" silicon handles the high-speed token generation.The verdict for 2026We are entering an era of extreme specialization. For decades, incumbents could win by shipping one dominant general-purpose architecture — and their blind spot was often what they ignored on the edges. Intel’s long neglect of low-power is the classic example, Michael Stewart, managing partner of Microsoft’s venture fund M12, told me. Nvidia is signaling it won’t repeat that mistake. “If even the leader, even the lion of the jungle will acquire talent, will acquire technology — it’s a sign that the whole market is just wanting more options,” Stewart said.For technical leaders, the message is to stop architecting your stack like it’s one rack, one accelerator, one answer. In 2026, advantage will go to the teams that label workloads explicitly — and route them to the right tier:prefill-heavy vs. decode-heavylong-context vs. short-contextinteractive vs. batchsmall-model vs. large-modeledge constraints vs. data-center assumptionsYour architecture will follow those labels. In 2026, “GPU strategy” stops being a purchasing decision and becomes a routing decision. The winners won’t ask which chip they bought — they’ll ask where every token ran, and why.",

While HBM provides extreme speed (though not as quick as Groq’s static random-access memory (SRAM)), its supply on GPUs is limited and its cost is a barrier to scale; GDDR7 provides a more cost-effective way to ingest massive datasets.Meanwhile, the \"Groq-flavored\" silicon, which Nvidia is integrating into its inference roadmap, will serve as the high-speed \"decode\" engine. This is about neutralizing a threat from alternative architectures like Google&#x27;s TPUs and maintaining the dominance of CUDA, Nvidia’s software ecosystem that has served as its primary moat for over a decade.All of this was enough for Baker, the Groq investor, to predict that Nvidia’s move to license Groq will cause all other specialized AI chips to be canceled — that is, outside of Google’s TPU, Tesla’s AI5, and AWS’s Trainium.2. The differentiated power of SRAMAt the heart of Groq’s technology is SRAM. Unlike the DRAM found in your PC or the HBM on an Nvidia H100 GPU, SRAM is etched directly into the logic of the processor.Michael Stewart, managing partner of Microsoft’s venture fund, M12, describes SRAM as the best for moving data over short distances with minimal energy. \"The energy to move a bit in SRAM is like 0.1 picojoules or less,\" Stewart said. \"To move it between DRAM and the processor is more like 20 to 100 times worse.\"In the world of 2026, where agents must reason in real-time, SRAM acts as the ultimate \"scratchpad\": a high-speed workspace where the model can manipulate symbolic operations and complex reasoning processes without the \"wasted cycles\" of external memory shuttling.However, SRAM has a major drawback: it is physically bulky and expensive to manufacture, meaning its capacity is limited compared to DRAM. This is where Val Bercovici, chief AI officer at Weka, another company offering memory for GPUs, sees the market segmenting.Groq-friendly AI workloads — where SRAM has the advantage — are those that use small models of 8 billion parameters and below, Bercovici said. This isn’t a small market, though. “It’s just a giant market segment that was not served by Nvidia, which was edge inference, low latency, robotics, voice, IoT devices — things we want running on our phones without the cloud for convenience, performance, or privacy,\" he said.This 8B \"sweet spot\" is significant because 2025 saw an explosion in model distillation, where many enterprise companies are shrinking massive models into highly efficient smaller versions. While SRAM isn&#x27;t practical for the trillion-parameter \"frontier\" models, it is perfect for these smaller, high-velocity models.3. The Anthropic threat: The rise of the ‘portable stack’Perhaps the most under-appreciated driver of this deal is Anthropic’s success in making its stack portable across accelerators.The company has pioneered a portable engineering approach for training and inference — basically a software layer that allows its Claude models to run across multiple AI accelerator families — including Nvidia’s GPUs and Google’s Ironwood TPUs. Until recently, Nvidia&#x27;s dominance was protected because running high-performance models outside of the Nvidia stack was a technical nightmare. “It’s Anthropic,” Weka’s Bercovici told me. “The fact that Anthropic was able to … build up a software stack that could work on TPUs as well as on GPUs, I don’t think that’s being appreciated enough in the marketplace.”(Disclosure: Weka has been a sponsor of VentureBeat events.)Anthropic recently committed to accessing up to 1 million TPUs from Google, representing over a gigawatt of compute capacity. This multi-platform approach ensures the company isn&#x27;t held hostage by Nvidia&#x27;s pricing or supply constraints. So for Nvidia, the Groq deal is equally a defensive move. By integrating Groq’s ultra-fast inference IP, Nvidia is making sure that the most performance-sensitive workloads — like those running small models or as part of real-time agents — can be accommodated within Nvidia’s CUDA ecosystem, even as competitors try to jump ship to Google&#x27;s Ironwood TPUs. CUDA is the special software Nvidia provides to developers to integrate GPUs. 4. The agentic ‘statehood’ war: Manus and the KV CacheThe timing of this Groq deal coincides with Meta’s acquisition of the agent pioneer Manus just two days ago. The significance of Manus was partly its obsession with statefulness.If an agent can’t remember what it did 10 steps ago, it is useless for real-world tasks like market research or software development. KV Cache (Key-Value Cache) is the \"short-term memory\" that an LLM builds during the prefill phase.Manus reported that for production-grade agents, the ratio of input tokens to output tokens can reach 100:1. This means for every word an agent says, it is \"thinking\" and \"remembering\" 100 others. In this environment, the KV Cache hit rate is the single most important metric for a production agent, Manus said. If that cache is \"evicted\" from memory, the agent loses its train of thought, and the model must burn massive energy to recompute the prompt.Groq’s SRAM can be a \"scratchpad\" for these agents — although, again, mostly for smaller models — because it allows for the near-instant retrieval of that state. Combined with Nvidia&#x27;s Dynamo framework and the KVBM, Nvidia is building an \"inference operating system\" that enables inference servers to tier this state across SRAM, DRAM, HBM, and other flash-based offerings like that from Bercovici’s Weka.Thomas Jorgensen, senior director of Technology Enablement at Supermicro, which specializes in building clusters of GPUs for large enterprise companies, told me in September that compute is no longer the primary bottleneck for advanced clusters. Feeding data to GPUs was the bottleneck, and breaking that bottleneck requires memory.\"The whole cluster is now the computer,\" Jorgensen said. \"Networking becomes an internal part of the beast … feeding the beast with data is becoming harder because the bandwidth between GPUs is growing faster than anything else.\"This is why Nvidia is pushing into disaggregated inference. By separating the workloads, enterprise applications can use specialized storage tiers to feed data at memory-class performance, while the specialized \"Groq-inside\" silicon handles the high-speed token generation.The verdict for 2026We are entering an era of extreme specialization. For decades, incumbents could win by shipping one dominant general-purpose architecture — and their blind spot was often what they ignored on the edges. Intel’s long neglect of low-power is the classic example, Michael Stewart, managing partner of Microsoft’s venture fund M12, told me. Nvidia is signaling it won’t repeat that mistake. “If even the leader, even the lion of the jungle will acquire talent, will acquire technology — it’s a sign that the whole market is just wanting more options,” Stewart said.For technical leaders, the message is to stop architecting your stack like it’s one rack, one accelerator, one answer. In 2026, advantage will go to the teams that label workloads explicitly — and route them to the right tier:prefill-heavy vs. decode-heavylong-context vs. short-contextinteractive vs. batchsmall-model vs. large-modeledge constraints vs. data-center assumptionsYour architecture will follow those labels. In 2026, “GPU strategy” stops being a purchasing decision and becomes a routing decision. The winners won’t ask which chip they bought — they’ll ask where every token ran, and why.",
