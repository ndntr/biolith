          "content": "Today, Microsoft and Asus are officially opening preorders for the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X at $599 and $999 respectively in the US. They’re $799 CAD and $1299 CAD in Canada, €599 and €899 in Europe, £499 and £799 in the UK, and $799 AUD and $1599 AUD in Australia. They both ship October 16th. (In the United States, the Xbox Ally X will be exclusive to Best Buy, the Asus Shop, and Microsoft; the Xbox Ally is going wider at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Microsoft, the Asus Shop, and Ant Online.) There’s a few different ways to look at those prices. If you’re used to console pricing, Microsoft’s first Xbox handhelds are not cheap! Even the vanilla white Xbox Ally costs $150 more than a Switch 2, which was itself criticized for price, and it costs $100 more than a far more powerful Xbox Series X did at launch in the US, Microsoft’s new Xbox price hike notwithstanding. In Europe and the UK, the weaker of the two Allys costs the same as an Xbox Series X. But you can’t play that Xbox in a passenger seat. And if you’re a PC gamer, or want to be, things look a bit rosier. These “Xbox” handhelds will be the first with a new build of Windows that hides the desktop and Explorer shell, frees up gobs of memory for your games, and (hopefully) lets you navigate solely by controller. Handhelds have unfortunately been getting pricier and pricier anyhow, to the point flagship ones now cost as much as gaming laptops. At $999, the Xbox Ally X might compare well to the $999 MSI Claw 8 AI Plus or the $1,349 Lenovo Legion Go 2 that offers the same AMD Z2 Extreme chip you’ll find here — particularly because my colleagues and I agree the new Allys have one of the most comfortable designs we’ve held. (In summary: Prongs rock.) Just know you’re getting a wildcard if you opt for the $599 Ally, as it contains a never-before-seen Ryzen Z2 A processor that’s much more like the chip in the Steam Deck. Instead of 8 Zen 5 CPU cores and 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores designed to run between 15 and 35 watt TDP, you’re getting 4 Zen 2 CPU cores and 8 RDNA 2 GPU cores designed to run between 6 and 20 watts for lower performance gaming. We’re planning to have reviews of the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X in the coming weeks. Microsoft says they’ll be available in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, and Vietnam — and will additionally come to Brazil China, India, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Philippines and Switzerland.",

Most of Amazon’s Fire-branded devices, which include tablets, currently run some version of Fire OS, which is an Android fork based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). For years, Fire OS’s reliance on AOSP has resulted in Amazon devices coming out with older software, such as 2024’s Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet, which came out with Fire OS 8, which is based on 2020’s Android 11. Some devices already run Amazon’s proprietary software, reportedly codenamed Vega OS. The current Echo Hub smart home control panel, Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) smart home display, and Echo Spot smart speaker all run an OS based on the Linux 5.16 kernel, per details in Amazon’s source code notice for Alexa devices. However, Amazon has never publicly acknowledged that the OS exists.Read full article Comments",

The preview feature, available now for Pro subscribers on mobile, marks OpenAI's latest attempt to make ChatGPT proactive rather than reactive, with the AI model conducting overnight research to deliver morning updates based on user history and connected apps. OpenAI calls it \"personalized research and timely updates that appear regularly to keep you informed.\" ChatGPT Pulse works by analyzing a user's chat history, saved preferences, and optional connections to Gmail and Google Calendar each night. The next morning, users receive visual \"cards\" (small illustrated squares with topic summaries that can be expanded for detail) containing updates on topics the model determines are relevant, such as project follow-ups, dinner suggestions, or travel recommendations. Users can provide feedback through thumbs up or down ratings and request specific topics through a \"curate\" button. OpenAI says that rather than waiting for users to initiate conversations, ChatGPT now attempts to deliver information preemptively using what OpenAI calls \"asynchronous research,\" essentially having the model generate queries and responses overnight using traditional methods. Updates appear once daily and disappear after 24 hours unless users save them or ask follow-up questions, which converts them into standard chat conversations.Read full article Comments",

The sheer magnitude of the cuts—including a 40 percent slashing of money going to the National Institutes of Health—would do severe harm to biomedical researchers and the industries that serve or rely on them. And, ultimately, that is likely to do harm to all of us. In today's issue of Science, some researchers have attempted to put numbers on those indirect effects that fall within that \"ultimately\" category. They've identified which grants wouldn't have been funded had similar cuts been made earlier in this century and tracked the impact that likely had on drug patents. Their conclusion: Development of roughly half the newly approved drugs relied on work that was funded by a grant that would need to be cut. From grants to drugs It's uncertain whether the proposed budget cuts will go through. At the moment, Congress is looking to fund most science agencies at levels similar to their current budgets. Should cuts eventually happen, then it's also difficult to predict how they'll be spread among the more than 20 institutes that make up the NIH (a number that the administration also wants to see reduced via consolidation). So, the researchers make a big simplifying assumption: Every institute within the NIH will take a 40 percent hit to its budget.Read full article Comments",

One feature that Apple has been particularly slow to move down the chain is ProMotion, the branding the company uses to refer to a screen that can refresh up to 120 times per second rather than the more typical 60 times per second. ProMotion isn't a necessary feature, but since Apple added it to the iPhone 13 Pro in 2021, the extra fluidity and smoothness, plus the always-on display feature, have been big selling points for the Pro phones. This year, ProMotion finally comes to the regular-old iPhone 17, years after midrange and even lower-end Android phones made the swap to 90 or 120 Hz display panels. And it sounds like a small thing, but the screen upgrade—together with a doubling of base storage from 128GB to 256GB—makes the gap between this year's iPhone and iPhone Pro feel narrower than it's been in a long time. If you jumped on the Pro train a few years back and don't want to spend that much again, this might be a good year to switch back. If you've ever been tempted by the Pro but never made the upgrade, you can continue not doing that and miss out on relatively little.Read full article Comments",

In the same way AI models output those data types, they can also be used to output robot actions. That's the foundation of Google DeepMind's Gemini Robotics project, which has announced a pair of new models that work together to create the first robots that \"think\" before acting. Traditional LLMs have their own set of problems, but the introduction of simulated reasoning did significantly upgrade their capabilities, and now the same could be happening with AI robotics. The team at DeepMind contends that generative AI is a uniquely important technology for robotics because it unlocks general functionality. Current robots have to be trained intensively on specific tasks, and they are typically bad at doing anything else. \"Robots today are highly bespoke and difficult to deploy, often taking many months in order to install a single cell that can do a single task,\" said Carolina Parada, head of robotics at Google DeepMind. The fundamentals of generative systems make AI-powered robots more general. They can be presented with entirely new situations and workspaces without needing to be reprogrammed.

Google’s DeepMind team has developed an AI system called RoboBallet that lets manufacturing robots figure out what to do on their own. Traveling salesmen Planning what manufacturing robots should do to get their jobs done efficiently is really hard to automate. You need to solve both task allocation and scheduling—deciding which task should be done by which robot in what order. It’s like the famous traveling salesman problem on steroids. On top of that, there is the question of motion planning; you need to make sure all these robotic arms won’t collide with each other or with all the gear standing around them. At the end, you’re facing myriad possible combinations where you’ve got to solve not one but three computationally hard problems at the same time. “There are some tools that let you automate motion planning, but task allocation and scheduling are usually done manually,” says Matthew Lai, a research engineer at Google DeepMind. “Solving all three of these problems combined is what we tackled in our work.”Read full article Comments",

And Flight Simulator 2024 has been available on Xbox Series S/X for almost a year now, as the name suggests, giving Xbox owners a \"timed exclusive\" at least. Still, it's a bit striking to see a franchise that literally has the Microsoft brand name integrated into its title moving to a major non-Microsoft platform like this.

Many of these features rely on Apple Intelligence, meaning they're only as reliable and helpful as Apple's generative AI (and only available on newer iPhones, besides). Other adjustments are smaller but could make a big difference to people who use their phone to do work tasks. Reminders attempt to get smarter The Reminders app gets the Apple Intelligence treatment in iOS 26, with the AI primarily focused on making it easier to organize content within Reminders lists. Lines in Reminders lists are often short, quickly jotted-down blurbs rather than lengthy, detailed complex instructions. With this in mind, it’s easy to see how the AI can sometimes lack enough information in order to perform certain tasks, like logically grouping different errands into sensible sections.Read full article Comments",

Endurance racing like the 24 Hours of Le Mans or the Rolex 24 at Daytona has seen record crowds over the last few years, and a large part of that is down to the sports prototype class, exemplified by cars from the likes of Ferrari and Porsche. And soon, we can add Ford to the list. Currently, eight different manufacturers are competing against each other in the World Endurance Championship's Hypercar class: Alpine, Aston Martin, BMW, Cadillac, Ferrari, Peugeot, Porsche, and Toyota. More are on the way—Genesis arrives next year, and at the beginning of the year, Ford announced that it, too, was joining the fray, in 2027. Today, the Blue Oval revealed some more details about the project. What’s a hypercar? Compared to the road car-derived machines that race in the GT3 category, the vehicles that contest for overall victory in the Hypercar class are purpose-built prototypes, just for racing. Because endurance racing often has to be needlessly complicated for the sake of being complicated, the Hypercar class is actually made up of a mix of vehicles designed to two different technical rule sets that are performance balanced to create a level playing field.Read full article Comments",
