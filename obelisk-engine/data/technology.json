On Tuesday, the company confirmed it’s shuffling executive roles, bringing on a new CTO of applications, and acquiring a product analytics company for $1.1 billion. Statsig, the company OpenAI is acquiring, specializes in A/B testing and other features for companies looking to improve their products, and OpenAI is bringing on its founder and CEO, Vijaye Raji, as a new C-suite executive. Raji will be OpenAI’s CTO of Applications, heading up product engineering for both ChatGPT and Codex, “with responsibilities that span core systems and product lines including infrastructure and Integrity,” OpenAI wrote in a blog post. He’ll report directly to Simo. “Once the acquisition is finalized, Statsig employees will become OpenAI employees,” OpenAI wrote in the blog post, noting that the deal’s close will be subject to regulatory approval. “It will continue operating independently and serving its customer base out of its Seattle office. We’ll take a measured approach to any future integration, ensuring continuity for current customers and enabling the team to stay focused on what they do best.” OpenAI also announced it was shuffling some other executive positions. Srinivas Narayanan, who heads up the company’s engineering and oversaw the development of ChatGPT, developer APIs, and more, is being promoted to another brand-new C-suite executive role: CTO of B2B Applications. Narayanan will oversee all the business-side applications, covering startups, enterprises, and government, and he’ll report directly to OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap. Kevin Weil, OpenAI’s CPO, will be transitioning onto the research side of OpenAI’s business, the company confirmed. He’ll be spinning up a new team at the company as its VP of AI for Science, working closely with Mark Chen, OpenAI’s chief research officer. As part of that transition, Weil’s former product team, including head of ChatGPT Nick Turley, will now report directly to Simo.",

          "content": "The sky is falling, and Gmail has supposedly been hacked to bits by malicious parties unknown. Or has it? Reports circulated last week claiming that Gmail was the subject of a major data breach, citing a series of warnings Google has distributed and increasing reports of phishing attacks. The hysteria was short-lived, though. In a brief post on its official blog, Google says that Gmail's security is \"strong and effective,\" and reports to the contrary are mistaken. This story seems to have developed due to a random confluence of security events. Google experienced a Gmail data breach in June, but the attack was limited to the company's corporate Salesforce server. The hacker was able to access publicly available information like business names and contact details, but no private information was compromised. Over the following weeks, Google alerted Gmail users to an increase in phishing attacks in July and August. It didn't offer many details, but many believed the spike in phishing was related to the corporate server breach. Indeed, more people are talking about hacking attempts on social media right now. This led to the claim that Gmail's entire user base of 2.5 billion people was about to be hacked at any moment, with some reports advising everyone to change their passwords and enable two-factor authentication. While that's generally good security advice, Google says the truth is much less dramatic.Read full article Comments",

He seems an unlikely hero for NASA's large rocket, which costs the federal government more than $2 billion to launch. Cruz, after all, is a self-described pro-capitalist, fiscal conservative.

In previous legislative sessions, Cruz has often carried legislation important to the commercial space industry, such as the American Space Commerce Act and the Space Frontier Act.

And anyone joining will have an opportunity to ask their biggest questions about how tariffs could impact consumer tech.

          "content": "Despite its lack of upgradeable system memory, Framework has tried to make its Framework Desktop a welcoming platform for upgraders and modders, releasing 3D-printable versions of a few case parts and generally sticking to standard-sized parts and standard connectors. Often, it's independent creators who are making the weirdest and most interesting mods for Framework's devices, but PC cooling company Noctua has just announced what amounts to a fairly major cooling upgrade for the Framework Desktop, at least for anyone with access to a 3D printer. By printing a new fan duct and a custom side panel, Noctua managed to lower the noise levels of the Framework Desktop's default cooling fan by between five and seven decibels, without replacing or modifying any other components. The key is apparently the design of the fan grill, which Noctua also used to reduce noise levels in the Noctua edition of this 1,600 W Seasonic power supply. The grill has a distinctive spiral pattern that allows the fan to move similar amounts of air at lower rotation speeds, which is where the noise reduction comes from.Read full article Comments",

The moves come after multiple reported incidents where ChatGPT allegedly failed to intervene appropriately when users expressed suicidal thoughts or experienced mental health episodes. \"This work has already been underway, but we want to proactively preview our plans for the next 120 days, so you won’t need to wait for launches to see where we’re headed,\" OpenAI wrote in a blog post published Tuesday. \"The work will continue well beyond this period of time, but we’re making a focused effort to launch as many of these improvements as possible this year.\" The planned parental controls represent OpenAI's most concrete response to concerns about teen safety on the platform so far. Within the next month, OpenAI says, parents will be able to link their accounts with their teens' ChatGPT accounts (minimum age 13) through email invitations, control how the AI model responds with age-appropriate behavior rules that are on by default, manage which features to disable (including memory and chat history), and receive notifications when the system detects their teen experiencing acute distress.Read full article Comments",

Some of Tesla's stiffest competition in China has come from BYD, but the Chinese automaker has started to experience its own struggles at home, too.

Even retro console superfans would be forgiven for not knowing about the LaserActive, a pricey LaserDisc player released in 1994 alongside swappable hardware modules that could add support for Sega Genesis and NEC TurboGrafx-16 games and controllers. Using those add-ons, you could also play a handful of games specifically designed for the LaserActive format, which combined game data and graphics with up to 60 minutes of full-screen, standard-definition analog video per side. Mega-LD games (as the Genesis-compatible LaserActive titles were called) were, for the most part, super-sized versions of the types of games you'd find on early CD-ROM console of the era. That means a lot of edutainment titles, branching dungeon crawlers, Dragon's Lair-style animated quick-time event challenges, and rail shooters that overlayed standard Genesis or TG-16 graphics on top of elaborate animated video backgrounds (sometimes complete with filmed actors).Read full article Comments",

Hank was infected in turn right before the pair returned to the lab; Scott Lang/Ant-Man was attacked, but Hank and Janet's daughter, Hope Pym, escaped. Within 24 hours, much of the northwestern US was infected, including many members of the Avengers who showed up to thwart the zombie apocalypse.Read full article Comments",
