Proper word selection is integral to strong communication, whether it's about relaying one’s feelings to another or explaining the terms of a deal, agreement, or transaction. Language can be confusing, but typically when something is available to \"buy,\" ownership of that good or access to that service is offered in exchange for money. That’s not really the case, though, when it comes to digital content. Often, streaming services like Amazon Prime Video offer customers the options to “rent” digital content for a few days or to “buy” it. Some might think that picking \"buy\" means that they can view the content indefinitely. But these purchases are really just long-term licenses to watch the content for as long as the streaming service has the right to distribute it—which could be for years, months, or days after the transaction.Read full article Comments",

This announcement may represent an effort to move away from dependence on OpenAI, despite Microsoft's substantial investment in that company. It comes more than a year after insider reports revealed that Microsoft was beginning work on its own foundational models. A post on the Microsoft AI blog describes two models. MAI-Voice-1 is a natural speech-generation model meant to deliver \"high-fidelity, expressive audio across both single and multi-speaker scenarios.\" The idea is that voice will be one of the main ways users interact with AI tools in the future, though we haven't really seen that come to fruition so far. The second model is called MAI-1-preview, and it's a foundational large language model specifically trained to drive Copilot, Microsoft's AI chatbot tool. It was trained on around 15,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, and runs inference on a single GPU. As reported last year, this model is significantly larger than the models seen in Microsoft's earlier experiments, which focused on smaller models meant to run locally, like Phi-3.Read full article Comments",

Kennedy Jr. ousted the agency's director, Susan Monarez, who had just weeks ago been confirmed by the Senate and earned Kennedy's praise for her \"unimpeachable scientific credentials.\" It appears those scientific chops are what led to her swift downfall. Since the Department of Health and Human Services announced on X late Wednesday that \"Susan Monarez is no longer director\" of the CDC, media reports have revealed that her forced removal was over her refusal to bend to Kennedy's anti-vaccine, anti-science agenda. The ouster appeared to be a breaking point for the agency overall, which has never fully recovered from the public pummeling it received at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. In its weakened position, the agency has since endured an onslaught of further criticism, vilification, and misinformation from Kennedy and the Trump administration, which also delivered brutal cuts, significantly slashing CDC's workforce, shuttering vital health programs, and hamstringing others. Earlier this month, a gunman, warped by vaccine misinformation, opened fire on the CDC's campus, riddling its buildings with hundreds of bullets, killing a local police officer, and traumatizing agency staff.Read full article Comments",

In the past, Tesla has been famously quick to offer up customer data stored on its servers to rebut claims made against the company. But in this case, the company said it had nothing. Specifically, the lawyers for the family wanted what's known as the \"collision snapshot,\" data captured by the car's cameras and other sensors in the seconds leading up to and after the crash. According to the trial, moments after the collision snapshot was uploaded to Tesla's servers, the local copy on the car was marked for deletion.

That's around two months after the first Windows builds with the 25H2 label were released to the other preview channels. Putting a new yearly Windows update in the Release Preview channel is analogous to the \"release to manufacturing\" (RTM) phase of years past, back when updates shipped on physical media that needed to be manufactured. Build numbers for this version of Windows start with 26200, rather than 24H2's 26100. The 25H2 update doesn't do a lot in and of itself, other than reset the clock for Microsoft's security updates (each yearly release gets two years of security patches). Microsoft says that last year's 24H2 update and this year's 25H2 update \"use a shared servicing branch,\" which mostly means that there aren't big under-the-hood differences between the two.

This could be observed on video taken from a buoy near the landing site as the vehicle made a soft landing in the Indian Ocean. This color—so different from the silvery skin and black tiles that cover Starship's upper stage—led to all sorts of speculation. Had heating damaged the stainless steel skin? Had the vehicle's tiles been shucked off, leaving behind some sort of orange adhesive material? Was this actually NASA's Space Launch System in disguise? The answer to this question was rather important, as SpaceX founder Elon Musk had said before this flight that gathering data about the performance of this heat shield was the most important aspect of the mission.Read full article Comments",

That's according to an Ars Technica analysis of decades of pricing data and price-cut timing across dozens of major US console releases. The overall direction of this trend has been apparent to industry watchers for a while now. Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft have failed to cut their console prices in recent years and have instead been increasing the nominal MSRP for many current consoles in the past six months. If the original Switch followed historic pricing trends, it could be selling for a bargain basement $100 to $150 right now. Credit: Kyle Orland Even accounting for inflation, some PS5 consoles are more expensive today than they were at launch. Credit: Kyle Orland Despite cratering Xbox hardware sales, Microsoft has been unwilling to cut prices on Xbox consoles. Credit: Kyle Orland But when you crunch the numbers, it's pretty incredible just how much today's console prices defy historic expectations, even when you account for higher-than-normal inflation in recent years. If today's consoles were seeing anything like what used to be standard price cuts over time, we could be paying around $200 today for pricey systems like the Switch OLED, PS5 Digital Edition, and Xbox Series S.Read full article Comments",

The company completed its first successful Starship test flight in nearly a year, and while it wasn't perfect, it sets up SpaceX for far more ambitious tests ahead. SpaceX's workhorse rocket, the Falcon 9, launched six times since our last edition of the Rocket Report. Many of these missions were noteworthy in their own right, including the launch of the US military's X-37B spaceplane, an upgraded Dragon capsule to boost the International Space Station to a higher orbit, and the record 30th launch and landing of a flight-proven Falcon 9 booster. All told, that's seven SpaceX launches in seven days. As always, we welcome reader submissions.

Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets, as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar. Firefly announces cause of Alpha launch failure. Firefly Aerospace closed the investigation into the failure of one of its Alpha rockets during an April mission for Lockheed Martin and received clearance from the FAA to resume launches, Payload reports. The loss of the launch vehicle was a dark cloud hanging over the company’s otherwise successful IPO this month. The sixth flight of Firefly's Alpha rocket launched in April from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, and failed when its first stage booster broke apart milliseconds after stage separation. This created a shockwave that destroyed the engine nozzle extension on the second stage, damaging the engine before the second stage ran out of propellant seconds before it attained orbital velocity. Both stages ultimately fell into the Pacific Ocean.Read full article Comments",

For people who miss the days of low-cost, tinkering-friendly Nexus phones, Google's vision is moving ever further away from that, but the attention to detail and overall polish of the Pixel experience continue with the Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL. These are objectively good phones with possibly the best cameras on the market, and they're also a little more powerful, but the aesthetics are seemingly locked down. Google made a big design change last year with the Pixel 9 series, and it's not reinventing the wheel in 2025. The Pixel 10 series keeps the same formula, making limited refinements, not all of which will be well-received. Google pulled out all the stops and added a ton of new AI features you may not care about, and it killed the SIM card slot. Just because Apple does something doesn't mean Google has to, but here we are. If you're still clinging to your physical SIM card or just like your Pixel 9, there's no reason to rush out to upgrade. A great but not so daring design If you liked the Pixel 9's design, you'll like the Pixel 10, because it's a very slightly better version of the same hardware. All three phones are made from aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (no titanium option here). The base model has a matte finish on the metal frame with a glossy rear panel, and it's the opposite on the Pro phones. This makes the more expensive phones a little less secure in the hand—those polished edges are slippery. The buttons on the Pixel 9 often felt a bit loose, but the buttons on all our Pixel 10 units are tight and clicky.Read full article Comments",

Submitted by a user named terauma, the 700-plus-piece set comes complete with keyboard, hockey-puck mouse, a classic Mac OS boot screen, and cathode ray tubes and circuit boards visible through the set's transparent blue casing (like the original iMac, it may cause controversy by excluding a floppy disk drive). The design has already reached 5,000 supporters, and it has 320 days left to reach the 10,000-supporter benchmark required to be reviewed by Lego. With its personality-forward aesthetics and Jony Ive-led design, the original iMac was the first step down the path that led to blockbuster products like the iPod and iPhone. It was the company's first all-new Mac design after CEO Steve Jobs returned to the company in the late '90s, and while it lacked some features included in contemporary PCs, its tightly integrated design and ease of setup helped it stand out against the beige desktop PCs of the day. Today's colorful Apple Silicon iMacs are clearly inspired by the original design.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "In the olden days, publishing a site on the Internet required that you figure out hosting and have at least some experience with HTML, CSS, and the other languages that make the Internet work. But the emergence of blogging and \"Web 2.0\" sites in the late '90s and early 2000s gave rise to a constellation of services that would offer to host all of your thoughts without requiring you to build the website part of your website. Many of those services are still around in some form—someone who really wanted to could still launch a new blog on LiveJournal, Xanga, Blogger, or WordPress.com. But one of the field's former giants is shutting down—and taking all of those old posts with it. TypePad announced that the service would be shutting down on September 30 and that everything hosted on it would also be going away on that date. That gives current and former users just over a month to export anything they want to save. TypePad had previously removed the ability to create new accounts at some point in 2020. It gave no specific rationale for the shutdown beyond calling it a \"difficult decision.\" As recently as March of this year, TypePad representatives were telling users there were \"no plans\" to shut down the service.Read full article Comments",

But there were a number of mammoth species, including less furry ones that inhabited temperate regions. And the furry ones include at least three species: the Eurasian steppe mammoth, the Arctic-specializing woolly mammoth, and the late-evolving North America-only Columbian mammoth. Because these species inhabited the Arctic, it has been remarkably easy to obtain DNA from them, providing a genetic picture of their relations. The DNA suggests that the woolly mammoth is an offshoot of the steppe mammoth lineage and was the first to migrate into North America. But the Columbian mammoth was a bit of an enigma; some genetic data suggested it was also a steppe offshoot, while other samples indicated it might be a woolly/steppe hybrid. But all of that data came from animals living in colder environments. In contrast, the Columbian mammoth ranged as far south as Central America. And now, a group of researchers has managed to obtain a bit of genetic information from bones found in the Basin of Mexico, which includes Mexico City. And these mammoths appear to form a distinct genetic cluster and are all more closely related to each other than to any other woolly or Columbian mammoths.Read full article Comments",
