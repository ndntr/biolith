          "standfirst": "Imagine you do two things on a Monday morning.First, you ask a chatbot to summarize your new emails. Next, you ask an AI tool to figure out why your top competitor grew so fast last quarter. The AI silently gets to work. It scours financial reports, news articles and social media sentiment. It cross-references that data with your internal sales numbers, drafts a strategy outlining three potential reasons for the competitor&#x27;s success and schedules a 30-minute meeting with your team to present its findings.We&#x27;re calling both of these \"AI agents,\" but they represent worlds of difference in intelligence, capability and the level of trust we place in them. This ambiguity creates a fog that makes it difficult to build, evaluate, and safely govern these powerful new tools. If we can&#x27;t agree on what we&#x27;re building, how can we know when we&#x27;ve succeeded?This post won&#x27;t try to sell you on yet another definitive framework. Instead, think of it as a survey of the current landscape of agent autonomy, a map to help us all navigate the terrain together.What are we even talking about? Defining an \"AI agent\"Before we can measure an agent&#x27;s autonomy, we need to agree on what an \"agent\" actually is. The most widely accepted starting point comes from the foundational textbook on AI, Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig’s “Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach.” They define an agent as anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators. A thermostat is a simple agent: Its sensor perceives the room temperature, and its actuator acts by turning the heat on or off.ReAct Model for AI Agents (Credit: Confluent) That classic definition provides a solid mental model. For today&#x27;s technology, we can translate it into four key components that make up a modern AI agent:Perception (the \"senses\"): This is how an agent takes in information about its digital or physical environment. It&#x27;s the input stream that allows the agent to understand the current state of the world relevant to its task.Reasoning engine (the \"brain\"): This is the core logic that processes the perceptions and decides what to do next. For modern agents, this is typically powered by a large language model (LLM). The engine is responsible for planning, breaking down large goals into smaller steps, handling errors and choosing the right tools for the job.Action (the \"hands\"): This is how an agent affects its environment to move closer to its goal. The ability to take action via tools is what gives an agent its power.Goal/objective: This is the overarching task or purpose that guides all of the agent&#x27;s actions. It is the \"why\" that turns a collection of tools into a purposeful system. The goal can be simple (\"Find the best price for this book\") or complex (\"Launch the marketing campaign for our new product\")Putting it all together, a true agent is a full-body system. The reasoning engine is the brain, but it’s useless without the senses (perception) to understand the world and the hands (actions) to change it. This complete system, all guided by a central goal, is what creates genuine agency.With these components in mind, the distinction we made earlier becomes clear. A standard chatbot isn&#x27;t a true agent. It perceives your question and acts by providing an answer, but it lacks an overarching goal and the ability to use external tools to accomplish it.An agent, on the other hand, is software that has agency. It has the capacity to act independently and dynamically toward a goal. And it&#x27;s this capacity that makes a discussion about the levels of autonomy so important.Learning from the past: How we learned to classify autonomyThe dizzying pace of AI can make it feel like we&#x27;re navigating uncharted territory. But when it comes to classifying autonomy, we’re not starting from scratch. Other industries have been working on this problem for decades, and their playbooks offer powerful lessons for the world of AI agents.The core challenge is always the same: How do you create a clear, shared language for the gradual handover of responsibility from a human to a machine?SAE levels of driving automationPerhaps the most successful framework comes from the automotive industry. The SAE J3016 standard defines six levels of driving automation, from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5 (fully autonomous).The SAE J3016 Levels of Driving Automation (Credit: SAE International) What makes this model so effective isn&#x27;t its technical detail, but its focus on two simple concepts:Dynamic driving task (DDT): This is everything involved in the real-time act of driving: steering, braking, accelerating and monitoring the road.Operational design domain (ODD): These are the specific conditions under which the system is designed to work. For example, \"only on divided highways\" or \"only in clear weather during the daytime.\"The question for each level is simple: Who is doing the DDT, and what is the ODD? At Level 2, the human must supervise at all times. At Level 3, the car handles the DDT within its ODD, but the human must be ready to take over. At Level 4, the car can handle everything within its ODD, and if it encounters a problem, it can safely pull over on its own.The key insight for AI agents: A robust framework isn&#x27;t about the sophistication of the AI \"brain.\" It&#x27;s about clearly defining the division of responsibility between human and machine under specific, well-defined conditions.Aviation&#x27;s 10 Levels of AutomationWhile the SAE’s six levels are great for broad classification, aviation offers a more granular model for systems designed for close human-machine collaboration. The Parasuraman, Sheridan, and Wickens model proposes a detailed 10-level spectrum of automation.Levels of Automation of Decision and Action Selection for Aviation (Credit: The MITRE Corporation)This framework is less about full autonomy and more about the nuances of interaction. For example:At Level 3, the computer \"narrows the selection down to a few\" for the human to choose from.At Level 6, the computer \"allows the human a restricted time to veto before it executes\" an action.At Level 9, the computer \"informs the human only if it, the computer, decides to.\"The key insight for AI agents: This model is perfect for describing the collaborative \"centaur\" systems we&#x27;re seeing today. Most AI agents won&#x27;t be fully autonomous (Level 10) but will exist somewhere on this spectrum, acting as a co-pilot that suggests, executes with approval or acts with a veto window.Robotics and unmanned systemsFinally, the world of robotics brings in another critical dimension: context. The National Institute of Standards and Technology&#x27;s (NIST) Autonomy Levels for Unmanned Systems (ALFUS) framework was designed for systems like drones and industrial robots.The Three-Axis Model for ALFUS (Credit: NIST) Its main contribution is adding context to the definition of autonomy, assessing it along three axes:Human independence: How much human supervision is required?Mission complexity: How difficult or unstructured is the task?Environmental complexity: How predictable and stable is the environment in which the agent operates?The key insight for AI agents: This framework reminds us that autonomy isn&#x27;t a single number. An agent performing a simple task in a stable, predictable digital environment (like sorting files in a single folder) is fundamentally less autonomous than an agent performing a complex task across the chaotic, unpredictable environment of the open internet, even if the level of human supervision is the same.The emerging frameworks for AI agentsHaving looked at the lessons from automotive, aviation and robotics, we can now examine the emerging frameworks designed for AI agents. While the field is still new and no single standard has won out, most proposals fall into three distinct, but often overlapping, categories based on the primary question they seek to answer.Category 1: The \"What can it do?\" frameworks (capability-focused)These frameworks classify agents based on their underlying technical architecture and what they are capable of achieving. They provide a roadmap for developers, outlining a progression of increasingly sophisticated technical milestones that often correspond directly to code patterns.A prime example of this developer-centric approach comes from Hugging Face. Their framework uses a star rating to show the gradual shift in control from human to AI:Five Levels of AI Agent Autonomy, as proposed by HuggingFace (Credit: Hugging Face) Zero stars (simple processor): The AI has no impact on the program&#x27;s flow. It simply processes information and its output is displayed, like a print statement. The human is in complete control.One star (router): The AI makes a basic decision that directs program flow, like choosing between two predefined paths (if/else). The human still defines how everything is done.Two stars (tool call): The AI chooses which predefined tool to use and what arguments to use with it. The human has defined the available tools, but the AI decides how to execute them.Three stars (multi-step agent): The AI now controls the iteration loop. It decides which tool to use, when to use it and whether to continue working on the task.Four stars (fully autonomous): The AI can generate and execute entirely new code to accomplish a goal, going beyond the predefined tools it was given.Strengths: This model is excellent for engineers. It&#x27;s concrete, maps directly to code and clearly benchmarks the transfer of executive control to the AI. Weaknesses: It is highly technical and less intuitive for non-developers trying to understand an agent&#x27;s real-world impact.Category 2: The \"How do we work together?\" frameworks (interaction-focused)This second category defines autonomy not by the agent’s internal skills, but by the nature of its relationship with the human user. The central question is: Who is in control, and how do we collaborate?This approach often mirrors the nuance we saw in the aviation models. For instance, a framework detailed in the paper Levels of Autonomy for AI Agents defines levels based on the user&#x27;s role:L1 - user as an operator: The human is in direct control (like a person using Photoshop with AI-assist features).L4 - user as an approver: The agent proposes a full plan or action, and the human must give a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" before it proceeds.L5 - user as an observer: The agent has full autonomy to pursue a goal and simply reports its progress and results back to the human.Levels of Autonomy for AI AgentsStrengths: These frameworks are highly intuitive and user-centric. They directly address the critical issues of control, trust, and oversight.Weaknesses: An agent with simple capabilities and one with highly advanced reasoning could both fall into the \"Approver\" level, so this approach can sometimes obscure the underlying technical sophistication.Category 3: The \"Who is responsible?\" frameworks (governance-focused)The final category is less concerned with how an agent works and more with what happens when it fails. These frameworks are designed to help answer crucial questions about law, safety and ethics.Think tanks like Germany&#x27;s Stiftung Neue VTrantwortung have analyzed AI agents through the lens of legal liability. Their work aims to classify agents in a way that helps regulators determine who is responsible for an agent&#x27;s actions: The user who deployed it, the developer who built it or the company that owns the platform it runs on?This perspective is essential for navigating complex regulations like the EU&#x27;s Artificial Intelligence Act, which will treat AI systems differently based on the level of risk they pose.Strengths: This approach is absolutely essential for real-world deployment. It forces the difficult but necessary conversations about accountability that build public trust.Weaknesses: It&#x27;s more of a legal or policy guide than a technical roadmap for developers.A comprehensive understanding requires looking at all three questions at once: An agent&#x27;s capabilities, how we interact with it and who is responsible for the outcome..Identifying the gaps and challengesLooking at the landscape of autonomy frameworks shows us that no single model is sufficient because the true challenges lie in the gaps between them, in areas that are incredibly difficult to define and measure.What is the \"Road\" for a digital agent?The SAE framework for self-driving cars gave us the powerful concept of an ODD, the specific conditions under which a system can operate safely. For a car, that might be \"divided highways, in clear weather, during the day.\" This is a great solution for a physical environment, but what’s the ODD for a digital agent?The \"road\" for an agent is the entire internet. An infinite, chaotic and constantly changing environment. Websites get redesigned overnight, APIs are deprecated and social norms in online communities shift. How do we define a \"safe\" operational boundary for an agent that can browse websites, access databases and interact with third-party services? Answering this is one of the biggest unsolved problems. Without a clear digital ODD, we can&#x27;t make the same safety guarantees that are becoming standard in the automotive world.This is why, for now, the most effective and reliable agents operate within well-defined, closed-world scenarios. As I argued in a recent VentureBeat article, forgetting the open-world fantasies and focusing on \"bounded problems\" is the key to real-world success. This means defining a clear, limited set of tools, data sources and potential actions. Beyond simple tool useToday&#x27;s agents are getting very good at executing straightforward plans. If you tell one to \"find the price of this item using Tool A, then book a meeting with Tool B,\" it can often succeed. But true autonomy requires much more. Many systems today hit a technical wall when faced with tasks that require:Long-term reasoning and planning: Agents struggle to create and adapt complex, multi-step plans in the face of uncertainty. They can follow a recipe, but they can&#x27;t yet invent one from scratch when things go wrong.Robust self-correction: What happens when an API call fails or a website returns an unexpected error? A truly autonomous agent needs the resilience to diagnose the problem, form a new hypothesis and try a different approach, all without a human stepping in.Composability: The future likely involves not one agent, but a team of specialized agents working together. Getting them to collaborate reliably, to pass information back and forth, delegate tasks and resolve conflicts is a monumental software engineering challenge that we are just beginning to tackle.The elephant in the room: Alignment and controlThis is the most critical challenge of all, because it&#x27;s not just technical, it&#x27;s deeply human. Alignment is the problem of ensuring an agent&#x27;s goals and actions are consistent with our intentions and values, even when those values are complex, unstated or nuanced.Imagine you give an agent the seemingly harmless goal of \"maximizing customer engagement for our new product.\" The agent might correctly determine that the most effective strategy is to send a dozen notifications a day to every user. The agent has achieved its literal goal perfectly, but it has violated the unstated, common-sense goal of \"don&#x27;t be incredibly annoying.\"This is a failure of alignment.The core difficulty, which organizations like the AI Alignment Forum are dedicated to studying, is that it is incredibly hard to specify fuzzy, complex human preferences in the precise, literal language of code. As agents become more powerful, ensuring they are not just capable but also safe, predictable and aligned with our true intent becomes the most important challenge we face.The future is agentic (and collaborative)The path forward for AI agents is not a single leap to a god-like super-intelligence, but a more practical and collaborative journey. The immense challenges of open-world reasoning and perfect alignment mean that the future is a team effort.We will see less of the single, all-powerful agent and more of an \"agentic mesh\" — a network of specialized agents, each operating within a bounded domain, working together to tackle complex problems. More importantly, they will work with us. The most valuable and safest applications will keep a human on the loop, casting them as a co-pilot or strategist to augment our intellect with the speed of machine execution. This \"centaur\" model will be the most effective and responsible path forward.The frameworks we&#x27;ve explored aren’t just theoretical. They’re practical tools for building trust, assigning responsibility and setting clear expectations. They help developers define limits and leaders shape vision, laying the groundwork for AI to become a dependable partner in our work and lives.Sean Falconer is Confluent&#x27;s AI entrepreneur in residence.",

Developers can now generate well-structured code from plain language prompts, saving hours of manual effort. These tools learn from vast codebases, offering context-aware recommendations that enhance productivity and reduce errors. Rather than starting from scratch, engineers can prototype quickly, iterate faster and focus on solving increasingly complex problems.As code generation tools grow in popularity, they raise questions about the future size and structure of engineering teams.

The capital goes much longer.”AI-powered coding may offer a fast solution for businesses under budget pressure — but its long-term effects on the field and labor pool cannot be ignored.As AI-powered coding rises, human expertise may diminish In the era of AI, the traditional journey to coding expertise that has long supported senior developers may be at risk. Easy access to large language models (LLMs) enables junior coders to quickly identify issues in code. While this speeds up software development, it can distance developers from their own work, delaying the growth of core problem-solving skills. As a result, they may avoid the focused, sometimes uncomfortable hours required to build expertise and progress on the path to becoming successful senior developers.Consider Anthropic’s Claude Code, a terminal-based assistant built on the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, which automates bug detection and resolution, test creation and code refactoring. Using natural language commands, it reduces repetitive manual work and boosts productivity.Microsoft has also released two open-source frameworks — AutoGen and Semantic Kernel — to support the development of agentic AI systems.

They just need to think carefully about when and how to deploy AI tools in development. These tools can be more than productivity boosters; they can act as interactive mentors, guiding coders in real time with explanations, alternatives and best practices.When used as a training tool, AI can reinforce learning by showing coders why code is broken and how to fix it—rather than simply applying a solution. For example, a junior developer using Claude Code might receive immediate feedback on inefficient syntax or logic errors, along with suggestions linked to detailed explanations. This enables active learning, not passive correction. It’s a win-win: Accelerating project timelines without doing all the work for junior coders.Additionally, coding frameworks can support experimentation by letting developers prototype agent workflows or integrate LLMs without needing expert-level knowledge upfront.

          "standfirst": "How a semiconductor veteran turned over a century of horticultural wisdom into AI-led competitive advantage For decades, a ritual played out across ScottsMiracle-Gro’s media facilities. Every few weeks, workers walked acres of towering compost and wood chip piles with nothing more than measuring sticks. They wrapped rulers around each mound, estimated height, and did what company President Nate Baxter now describes as “sixth-grade geometry to figure out volume.”Today, drones glide over those same plants with mechanical precision. Vision systems calculate volumes in real time. The move from measuring sticks to artificial intelligence signals more than efficiency. It is the visible proof of one of corporate America’s most unlikely technology stories.The AI revolution finds an unexpected leaderEnterprise AI has been led by predictable players. Software companies with cloud-native architectures. Financial services firms with vast data lakes. Retailers with rich digital touchpoints. Consumer packaged goods companies that handle physical products like fertilizer and soil were not expected to lead.Yet ScottsMiracle-Gro has realized more than half of a targeted $150 million in supply chain savings. It reports a 90 percent improvement in customer service response times. Its predictive models enable weekly reallocation of marketing resources across regional markets.A Silicon Valley veteran bets on soil scienceBaxter’s path to ScottsMiracle-Gro (SMG) reads like a calculated pivot, not a corporate rescue. After two decades in semiconductor manufacturing at Intel and Tokyo Electron, he knew how to apply advanced technology to complex operations.“I sort of initially said, ‘Why would I do this? I’m running a tech company. It’s an industry I’ve been in for 25 years,’” Baxter recalls of his reaction when ScottsMiracle-Gro CEO Jim Hagedorn approached him in 2023. The company was reeling from a collapsed $1.2 billion hydroponics investment and facing what he describes as “pressure from a leverage standpoint.”His wife challenged him with a direct prompt. If you are not learning or putting yourself in uncomfortable situations, you should change that.Baxter saw clear parallels between semiconductor manufacturing and SMG’s operations. Both require precision, quality control, and the optimization of complex systems. He also saw untapped potential in SMG’s domain knowledge. One hundred fifty years of horticultural expertise, regulatory know-how, and customer insight had never been fully digitized.“It became apparent to me whether it was on the backend with data analytics, business process transformation, and obviously now with AI being front and center of the consumer experience, a lot of opportunities are there,” he explains.The declaration that changed everythingThe pivot began at an all-hands meeting. “I just said, you know, guys, we’re a tech company. You just don’t know it yet,” Baxter recalls. “There’s so much opportunity here to drive this company to where it needs to go.”The first challenge was organizational. SMG had evolved into functional silos. IT, supply chain, and brand teams ran independent systems with little coordination. Drawing on his experience with complex technology organizations, Baxter restructured the consumer business into three business units. General managers became accountable not just for financial results but also for technology implementation within their domains.“I came in and said, we’re going to create new business units,” he explains. “The buck stops with you and I’m holding you accountable not only for the business results, for the quality of the creative and marketing, but for the implementation of technology.”To support the new structure, SMG set up centers of excellence for digital capabilities, insights and analytics, and creative functions. The hybrid design placed centralized expertise behind distributed accountability.Mining corporate memory for AI goldTurning legacy knowledge into machine-ready intelligence required what Fausto Fleites, VP of Data Intelligence, calls “archaeological work.” The team excavated decades of business logic embedded in legacy SAP systems and converted filing cabinets of research into AI-ready datasets. Fleites, a Cuban immigrant with a doctorate from FIU who led Florida’s public hurricane loss model before roles at Sears and Cemex, understood the stakes.“The costly part of the migration was the business reporting layer we have in SAP Business Warehouse,” Fleites explains. “You need to uncover business logic created in many cases over decades.”SMG chose Databricks as its unified data platform. The team had Apache Spark expertise. Databricks offered strong SAP integration and aligned with a preference for open-source technologies that minimize vendor lock-in.The breakthrough came through systematic knowledge management. SMG built an AI bot using Google’s Gemini large language model to catalog and clean internal repositories. The system identified duplicates, grouped content by topic, and restructured information for AI consumption. The effort reduced knowledge articles by 30 percent while increasing their utility.“We used Gemini LLMs to actually categorize them into topics, find similar documents,” Fleites explains. A hybrid approach that combined modern AI with techniques like cosine similarity became the foundation for later applications.Building AI systems that actually understand fertilizerEarly trials with off-the-shelf AI exposed a real risk. General-purpose models confused products designed for killing weeds with those for preventing them. That mistake can ruin a lawn.“Different products, if you use one in the wrong place, would actually have a very negative outcome,” Fleites notes. “But those are kind of synonyms in certain contexts to the LLM. So they were recommending the wrong products.”The solution was a new architecture. SMG created what Fleites calls a “hierarchy of agents.” A supervisor agent routes queries to specialized worker agents organized by brand. Each agent draws on deep product knowledge encoded from a 400-page internal training manual.The system also changes the conversation. When users ask for recommendations, the agents start with questions about location, goals, and lawn conditions. They narrow possibilities step by step before offering suggestions. The stack integrates with APIs for product availability and state-specific regulatory compliance.From drones to demand forecasting across the enterpriseThe transformation runs across the company. Drones measure inventory piles. Demand forecasting models analyze more than 60 factors, including weather patterns, consumer sentiment, and macroeconomic indicators.These predictions enable faster moves. When drought struck Texas, the models supported a shift in promotional spending to regions with favorable weather. The reallocation helped drive positive quarterly results.“We not only have the ability to move marketing and promotion dollars around, but we’ve even gotten to the point where if it’s going to be a big weekend in the Northeast, we’ll shift our field sales resources from other regions up there,” Baxter explains.Consumer Services changed as well. AI agents now process incoming emails through Salesforce, draft responses based on the knowledge base, and flag them for brief human review. Draft times dropped from ten minutes to seconds and response quality improved.The company emphasizes explainable AI. Using SHAP, SMG built dashboards that decompose each forecast and show how weather, promotions, or media spending contribute to predictions.“Typically, if you open a prediction to a business person and you don’t say why, they’ll say, ‘I don’t believe you,’” Fleites explains. Transparency made it possible to move resource allocation from quarterly to weekly cycles.Competing like a startupSMG’s results challenge assumptions about AI readiness in traditional industries. The advantage does not come from owning the most sophisticated models. It comes from combining general-purpose AI with unique, structured domain knowledge.“LLMs are going to be a commodity,” Fleites observes. “The strategic differentiator is what is the additional level of [internal] knowledge we can fit to them.”Partnerships are central. SMG works with Google Vertex AI for foundational models, Sierra.ai for production-ready conversational agents, and Kindwise for computer vision. The ecosystem approach lets a small internal team recruited from Meta, Google, and AI startups deliver outsized impact without building everything from scratch.Talent follows impact. Conventional wisdom says traditional companies cannot compete with Meta salaries or Google stock. SMG offered something different. It offered the chance to build transformative AI applications with immediate business impact.“When we have these interviews, what we propose to them is basically the ability to have real value with the latest knowledge in these spaces,” Fleites explains. “A lot of people feel motivated to come to us” because much of big tech AI work, despite the hype, “doesn’t really have an impact.”Team design mirrors that philosophy. “My direct reports are leaders and not only manage people, but are technically savvy,” Fleites notes. “We always are constantly switching hands between developing or maintaining a solution versus strategy versus managing people.” He still writes code weekly. The small team of 15 to 20 AI and engineering professionals stays lean by contracting out implementation while keeping “the know-how and the direction and the architecture” in-house.When innovation meets immovable objectsNot every pilot succeeded. SMG tested semi-autonomous forklifts in a 1.3 million square foot distribution facility. Remote drivers in the Philippines controlled up to five vehicles at once with strong safety records.“The technology was actually really great,” Baxter acknowledges. The vehicles could not lift enough weight for SMG’s heavy products. The company paused implementation.“Not everything we’ve tried has gone smoothly,” Baxter admits. “But I think another important point is you have to focus on a few critical ones and you have to know when something isn’t going to work and readjust.”The lesson tracks with semiconductor discipline. Investments must show measurable returns within set timeframes. Regulatory complexity adds difficulty. Products must comply with EPA rules and a patchwork of state restrictions, which AI systems must navigate correctly.The gardening sommelier and agent-to-agent futuresThe roadmap reflects a long-term view. SMG plans a “gardening sommelier” mobile app in 2026 that identifies plants, weeds, and lawn problems from photos and provides instant guidance. A beta already helps field sales teams answer complex product questions by querying the 400-page knowledge base.The company is exploring agent-to-agent communication so its specialized AI can interface with retail partners’ systems. A customer who asks a Walmart chatbot for lawn advice could trigger an SMG query that returns accurate, regulation-compliant recommendations.SMG has launched AI-powered search on its website, replacing keyword systems with conversational engines based on the internal stack. The future vision pairs predictive models with conversational agents so the system can reach out when conditions suggest a customer may need help.What traditional industries can learnScottsMiracle-Gro&#x27;s transformation offers a clear playbook for enterprises. The advantage doesn&#x27;t come from deploying the most sophisticated models. Instead, it comes from combining AI with proprietary domain knowledge that competitors can&#x27;t easily replicate.By making general managers responsible for both business results and technology implementation, SMG ensured AI wasn&#x27;t just an IT initiative but a business imperative. The 150 years of horticultural expertise only became valuable when it was digitized, structured, and made accessible to AI systems.Legacy companies competing for AI engineers can&#x27;t match Silicon Valley compensation packages. But they can offer something tech giants often can&#x27;t: immediate, measurable impact. When engineers see their weather forecasting models directly influence quarterly results or their agent architecture prevent customers from ruining their lawns, the work carries weight that another incremental improvement to an ad algorithm never will.“We have a right to win,” Baxter says. “We have 150 years of this experience.” That experience is now data, and data is the company’s competitive edge. ScottsMiracle-Gro didn’t outspend its rivals or chase the newest AI model. It turned knowledge into an operating system for growth. For a company built on soil, its biggest breakthrough might be cultivating data.",

Some gorgeous new games arrived this week, and we've got some demos and reveals from upcoming projects to take a look at. Later this month, Lorelai and the Laser Eyes studio Simogo is going to celebrate its 15th anniversary with some news and surprises. Perhaps the developer is porting some of its earlier games to more platforms. I'm hoping that we'll learn about Simogo's next game as well.I'm not holding out hope for a sequel to Sayonara Wild Hearts, which is my favorite game of all time depending on the day you ask me (on other days, it's The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, FYI). However, if Simogo announces a live concert of music from the game, I'm going to do my damndest to be there. I'll be tuning in on October 28 to learn what the studio has for me us in any case.Speaking of showcases, Entalto Publishing and developer GGTech ran one of their own this week. The Out of Bounds event shone a spotlight on a dozen indie games, spanning a breadth of genres. Also, a quick reminder that the latest Steam Next Fest starts at 1PM ET on Monday, October 13. As always, the week-long event will have tons of demos for you to check out. It’s always worth trying a bunch of them. You never know, you might end up being one of the first few folks to play the next Balatro, Manor Lords or Deep Rock Galactic Survivor.New releasesAbsolum is a beat-'em-up from the folks behind Streets of Rage 4. It's the first original IP from Dotemu, which has found success with the likes of the terrific Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge. It co-developed this game with Guard Crush Games and Supamonks. The art and animation from the latter looks absolutely divine. You can play Absolum solo or with a friend. Since it's a roguelite, you'll gain upgrades to bolster your character on each run while earning experience that goes toward permanent progression. There are multiple paths to explore, so the replayability factor seems strong here. Engadget senior reporter Igor Bonifacic spent some time with Absolum this summer and was impressed by it. The game received strong reviews this week too.Absolum is out now on Steam, Nintendo Switch, PS4 and PS5. Dotemu also has another beat-'em-up, Marvel Cosmic Invasion, coming soon.A few reviews I've read for Bye Sweet Carole (which are fairly mixed) dinged it for having clunky controls and some other quality-of-life problems, such as getting softlocked while trying to complete puzzles. I hope Little Sewing Machine can iron out those issues since the presentation of this game is quite something. It looks like an early-'90s animated movie, with hand-drawn animations and, seemingly, a soundtrack to match. Bye Sweet Carole is a 2D horror-platformer from publisher Maximum Entertainment in which you play as a young girl trying to find her best friend, who disappeared from an orphanage. It's out now on PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch and Xbox Series X/S.Want to see another new game with a unique look that makes it stand out from the crowd? Of course you do. Exploration action game Dreams of Another — which landed on PS5, PS VR2 and Steam this week — sees you creating the environment in a dream-like world by shooting at it. Director Baiyon (PixelJunk Eden) and the team at Q-Games used point cloud rendering technology to create the unusual, but captivating visuals. Dunno why they felt the need to put a clown in this game though. Clowns are rotten things.Dreams of Another arrived on the same day that Q-Games' PixelJunk Eden 2 hit PS4, PS5 and Steam (it's coming to Epic Games Store as well). That game debuted on Nintendo Switch in 2020.Here's yet another lovely-looking project, and this time it's a pixel-art game from Teenage Astronauts and publisher No More Robots. In Little Rocket Lab, you play as aspiring engineer Morgan, who sets out to build factories with the aim of achieving her family's dream of making a rocket ship. It’s more build a rocket, girl, than Build A Rocket Boy.This is a blend of a factory builder and life sim, and it looks rather charming. Little Rocket Lab has touched down on Steam and Xbox. It's on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. On the subject of pixel-art games, I couldn't not include one that came out this week from a developer based in my hometown. Cairn: Mathair’s Curse is a turn-based RPG. It's set in the early 2000s in the Scottish Highlands and it sees a young lad and his mates dealing with the aftermath of a cult casting an ancient curse on their home. Solo developer Ross McRitchie spent five years making Cairn: Mathair’s Curse and his partner, Christine, composed the Celtic soundtrack. It's said to have plenty of Scottish humor, which speaks to me. The game, which Steam reviews have likened to EarthBound, is out on Steam now.Upcoming I'm looking forward to checking out Blackwood, which is slated to hit Steam in the second half of 2026. It has a pretty great pitch:By day, you run a DVD store in 2012 New York. By night, you’re a ruthless assassin. Blackwood is a cinematic third-person shooter with grounded melee combat, brutal takedowns, responsive gunplay and a double life to manage.The facial animations look a little rough in the reveal trailer, but it's alpha footage and there's plenty of time to polish it. I'm hoping the team at Bangladesh-based AttritoM7 Productions manages to do that, because otherwise this game is looking quite nifty with its John Wick-style combat.I do love a game with a great name, and I've got a couple to tell you about. Action RPG Bittersweet Birthday has hand-drawn pixel art and nothing but boss battles when it comes to combat. Bittersweet Birthday — from World Eater Games and publisher Dangen Entertainment — is set to land on Steam, GOG, Humble and Itch on November 11. It's coming to consoles later.Here’s a pinball-themed precision platformer in the mold of games like Baby Steps and Getting Over It. Fittingly, it's called A Pinball Game That Makes You Mad and you can control it with a single button.There’s no release date as yet for this project from Azimuth Studios. However, a demo is available on Steam now. Like a good teenage cousin, it's fun and annoying in equal measure.Another pre-Next Fest demo I've had a chance to check out is for Don't Stop, Girlypop!, a fast-paced arena shooter with an anti-capitalist bent. I've been looking forward to this one since I found out about it late last year. The demo, with its Y2K girly-pop aesthetics and Doom Eternal/Ultrakill-style gameplay, does not disappoint. I'm glad the team trimmed the first word from the original name — Incolatus: Don't Stop, Girlypop! — since the shorter version is much punchier and more memorable.

This makes the project \"informational material\" rather than a \"game,\" and therefore CAH can avoid import tariffs. All profits from the one-off project will be donated to the American Library Association to fight censorship. While a clever way to stick it to Trump, this week's news did raise a question I've heard from several readers: If CAH is this upset about the whiplash-inducing tariff rates, which are added and then removed with almost no warning, why doesn't it print the game in the US? I mean, it's just a box of cards! How hard can it be? In the board game space, designers have wrestled with this question for years. While many US-based designers would like to work with local manufacturers, in reality, it's often not possible. Complex board games today may feature cardboard creations like constructible dice towers, custom-shaped and painted wooden markers, multicolored jewel pieces, plastic bits of nearly every possible variety, custom-printed component bags, molded miniatures, cards in multiple sizes, metallic coins, dry-erase boards, fancy box inserts, massive dual-sided playing boards, and long manuals. The only manufacturers capable of doing all this work are generally in China or central Europe (Germany still has good manufacturing, and there are also sites in Poland and the Czech Republic).Read full article Comments",

Now the company is upping the stakes again. At the Hexacon offensive security conference in Paris on Friday, Apple vice president of security engineering and architecture Ivan Krstić announced a new maximum payout of $2 million for a chain of software exploits that could be abused for spyware. The move reflects how valuable exploitable vulnerabilities can be within Apple's highly protected mobile environment—and the lengths the company will go to to keep such discoveries from falling into the wrong hands. In addition to individual payouts, the company's bug bounty also includes a bonus structure, adding additional awards for exploits that can bypass its extra secure Lockdown Mode as well as those discovered while Apple software is still in its beta testing phase. Taken together, the maximum award for what would otherwise be a potentially catastrophic exploit chain will now be $5 million. The changes take effect next month. “We are lining up to pay many millions of dollars here, and there’s a reason,” Krstić tells WIRED. “We want to make sure that for the hardest categories, the hardest problems, the things that most closely mirror the kinds of attacks that we see with mercenary spyware—that the researchers who have those skills and abilities and put in that effort and time can get a tremendous reward.\"Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Amazon Echo Show owners are reporting an uptick in advertisements on their smart displays. The company's Echo Show smart displays have previously shown ads through the company's Shopping Lists feature, as well as advertising for Alexa skills. Additionally, Echo Shows may play audio ads when users listen to Amazon Music on Alexa. However, reports on Reddit (examples here, here, and here) and from The Verge’s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, who owns more than one Echo Show, suggest that Amazon has increased the amount of ads it shows on its smart displays' home screens. The Echo Show’s apparent increase in ads is pushing people to stop using or even return their Echo Shows.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Marvel Studios has dropped the first teaser for Wonder Man, an eight-episode miniseries slated for a January release, ahead of its panel at New York Comic Con this weekend. Part of the MCU's Phase Six, the miniseries was created by Destin Daniel Cretton (Shang-Chi and the Legend of Five Rings) and Andrew Guest (Hawkeye), with Guest serving as showrunner. It has been in development since 2022. The comic book version of the character is the son of a rich industrialist who inherits the family munitions factory but is being crushed by the competition: Stark Industries. Baron Zemo (Falcon and the Winter Soldier) then recruits him to infiltrate and betray the Avengers, giving him super powers (\"ionic energy\") via a special serum. He eventually becomes a superhero and Avengers ally, helping them take on Doctor Doom, among other exploits. Since we know Doctor Doom is the Big Bad of the upcoming two new Avengers movies, a Wonder Man miniseries makes sense.Read full article Comments",
