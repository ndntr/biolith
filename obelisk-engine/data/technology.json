          "standfirst": "If streaming services’ year-in-review campaigns have shown us anything, it’s that we’ve spent a staggering amount of time drowning out the hum of everyday life with music, podcasts and audio series. And with some incredible new releases this year, we were really eatin’ good. Here are some of the Engadget team’s favorite things we listened to in 2025.Spiritbox - Tsunami SeaI became aware of Spiritbox in late 2024 shortly before the band dropped its latest album, Tsunami Sea. At the time, I was in a deep Sleep Token phase, and I don’t remember how I stumbled upon Spiritbox, but I’m sure glad I did. Not knowing anything about the band, I initially thought it had two singers: one for clean vocals and another for the harsh, guttural screams. Well, I was wrong. Vocalist Courtney LaPlante handles it all, and she is a force of nature. After learning of a new band, I do what any self-respecting music nerd does: I looked up live videos of them on YouTube. The way LaPlante seamlessly transitions from airy, ambient singing to some of the best growls you’ll hear in metal music is effortless. And after seeing Spiritbox live in person earlier in December, I can attest to her ability to consistently nail both vocal styles for the entirety of an hour-long set. My infatuation with Spiritbox isn’t just with the vocalist though. Guitarist Mike Stringer, LaPlante’s husband, also has a lot of unique abilities to offer. Stringer’s use of noise and whammy effects in his riffs create a signature style, not to mention his mix of nu-metal, djent and metalcore sensibilities. He also has some of the thickest guitar tones I’ve ever heard live, and I was mesmerized for the full set. Stringer’s guitar work on Tsunami Sea is a prime example of a unique musician at the height of his powers. Tsunami Sea takes you on a ride. The first two tracks are all-out ragers, and after a slight respite in “Perfect Soul” and “Keep Sweet,” the album’s best song comes fifth. I’ve heard LaPlante dedicate it to “all the people I love to fucking hate,” and it’s clearly written about her enemies. It’s also the perfect example of what this band is capable of. It’s three minutes of LaPlante’s screams interlaced with plenty of Stringer’s trademark guitar work. The rest of the album showcases the band’s ability to blend dynamics, with “No Loss, No Love” and “Ride The Wave” providing the highlights on the back half of the record. The album’s title track is a great vehicle for LaPlante’s clean vocals, serving as the introduction to the album’s second act. If you’ve been enamored with Sleep Token this year like I have, give Spiritbox a go — you won’t be sorry you did. — Billy Steele, Deputy Editor, ReviewsBandsplainI didn’t discover Bandsplain in 2025, but I definitely listened to it more than any other podcast in terms of total time spent. Sure, that’s because most episodes are over three hours long, but I digress. Host Yasi Salek does a deep dive on “cult bands and iconic artists” to… ahem, bandsplain why people love them. There’s a deep catalog of back episodes, so there’s sure to be an in-depth analysis of a band you’re familiar with. But even if you think you know an artist, I’m willing to bet Salek will divulge parts of the story you weren’t aware of. Jimmy Eat World’s Clarity is a top 5 all-timer for me, and Salek had plenty to offer about the narrative around that album I didn’t know. Her grunge series from 2024 was a history lesson I wish I’d had in middle school when I first discovered Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and the rest of the lot. An older episode about Nine Inch Nails served as the primer for me seeing the band live for the first time in September. And that’s the thing about the show: the back catalog holds up. If you’re waiting for the next installment to drop, there’s certainly something in the archives you’ll enjoy. No shade to Salek’s colleagues at The Ringer, but the best episodes of Bandsplain are when the guest is a musician. Thursday front man Geoff Rickly was excellent on that Nine Inch Nails episode, and Death Cab for Cutie singer Ben Gibbard had me on the edge of my seat when he was on to discuss The La’s — a band I’d never heard of before. I’d also highly recommend the episodes on Oasis and the more recent one on Alanis Morissette. But, really, you can’t go wrong starting from anywhere on the episode list. — B.S.Lucy Dacus - Forever is a Feeling I remember being a teenager and hearing from an adult that they did not religiously seek out, research, evaluate and introduce new bands and songs into their lives as if all existence would cease without the life-sustaining energy of new music. I was confused, concerned and damn sure that wouldn’t happen to me. You know where this story goes: Job. Kid. House. Spouse. Pets that will die if I don’t feed, walk, play with and/or medicate them. I allow the algorithm to feed me new songs but rarely does something stick, so I end up listening to tracks I bonded with in my teens and twenties. This year, Blossom & Bones, a three-day music festival in Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, managed to push through the churn and lodge new music into my brain. Along with my kid and some friends, I camped among some of the most beautiful landscapes imaginable and ambled over to the stage each evening for performances by Santigold, Ani DiFranco and about a dozen more. Lucy Dacus, one third of the indie group Boygenius, did a one-hour set with plenty of songs from her latest album Forever is a Feeling. Hearing the songs for the first time, I felt like I’d been listening to them for years. Lilting harmonies and layered strings create a lovely backdrop for Dacus’s velvet voice, but there’s a sharpness to her observations about relationships, rejection and sex. I’ve been looping the album ever since. — Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter, Buying AdviceBlanco White - “So Certain” (single)Early on the last concert of the day at that same festival, Blanco White took the stage. People were aimlessly milling about and the sun hadn’t yet set. Kids were playing on the lawn and the smell from the food trucks was intense, but I was enrapt by the four people on stage. The sad violin and strummy guitars floated with the hand-beat drum out into the red hills. The music sounded like I felt: rooted and wrapped in the harsh beauty of the desert and I was really glad to take that home with me. — A.S.Martian Revolution If you're as big a nerd as I am, you might know that Leo Tolstoy didn't consider War and Peace to be a novel. The story is what most people read for, but in the author's mind, all the drama was a parable to illustrate his grand theory of history.Over the last year, history podcaster Mike Duncan has accomplished a similar feat using a medium Tolstoy never imagined. Duncan's Revolutions podcast has covered ten different revolutionary upheavals across history, starting with the English Civil War and ending with the Russian Revolution. After wrapping up the Bolsheviks, Duncan took a few episodes to suggest a grand theory of how revolutions unfold. For a while, it seemed like that was all we'd get. Then, in the middle of 2024, he started posting original sci-fi — without any indication that this tale, which followed future Martians revolting against their corporate overlords on Earth, was in any way different from the previous ten seasons.Part of what makes the Martian Revolution so excellent is Duncan's deadpan delivery. He never once breaks character. He rattles off lists of fictional sources, apologizes for inaccuracies in prior episodes, and introduces made-up historical figures with the same gravity he once used to mention George Washington or Simon Bolivar. If you're a fan of Revolutions, you'll have a blast recognizing character archetypes. (Mabel Dore is the Liberal Noble! Timothy Werner is the Man of Blood!)But the podcast is great even if you've never listened to an episode of Revolutions. It has an excellent grasp of character and a sense of inevitable tragedy, but with moments of joy leavened throughout. I certainly hope we don't wind up in the megacorp-ruled future of the podcast, but if we do, it'll be a great consolation if it eventually turns out the way Duncan imagines. — Sam Chapman, Senior WriterRon Gallo - Checkmate My favorite artists are ones that surprise me, and Ron Gallo is a master of reinvention. He's dabbled in absurdist punk, psychedelia, garage rock, Beatles-tinged pop and, now, stripped-down acoustic music. This is not a genre I am typically a fan of, Elliott Smith withstanding, but Checkmate is something special. His lyrical prowess is off the charts here, trading his usual wordplay for simple and emotionally-gutting truisms about life, love and, well, the end of the world. Of course, the lyrics wouldn't work if the songs weren't good. The songs are very good. The title track is just about the perfect love song, with a primary hook that gets lost in your head for weeks. Other tracks offer hints of Mac DeMarco, Dan Fogelberg, Kevin Morby and just about everyone else who has crafted great songs on an acoustic guitar. It's fitting that Gallo has found a home on the label Kill Rock Stars, which released so much of Elliott Smith's work back in the day. As an aside, Gallo regularly posts songs about current events on TikTok and other social media platforms, which are worth checking out if you like stuff like Jesse Welles. — Lawrence Bonk, Contributing ReporterDe La Soul - Cabin in the SkyThere have been hip-hop albums that explored the finality and tragedy of death, but not many that truly tackled spirituality and long-term grief. De La Soul has done just that, following the passing of founding member Trugoy the Dove. This album serves as a final testament of sorts for Trugoy, as he's heavily featured throughout. In that way, Cabin in the Sky is reminiscent of A Tribe Called Quest's 2016 masterpiece We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service, which followed the death of rapper Phife Dawg. Like Tribe's modern classic, Cabin in the Sky is filled with absolute bangers. It features standout beats by DJ Premier, Pete Rock, Trugoy, Jake One and others. The rhymes are great and all three primary De La members are given time to shine. Guest rappers like Common and Nas got the memo, delivering some of their most memorable verses in years. Heck, even Giancarlo Esposito is on board as the narrator. Some reviewers have dinged this album for being too long but, come on, that's like complaining there's too much pizza. It's De La Soul. — L.B.FKA twigs - EusexuaThis was a really good year for new music IMO, so much that I've been finding it pretty difficult to think back and settle on my favorite releases. But, FKA twigs' Eusexua undeniably did some heavy lifting for me, pretty much carrying me through the first six or so months of the year without much competition, and I've circled right back to it as the year closes. It's an album that somehow seems to meet every vibe. It'll have you in club mode and ready for a night of sweaty, filthy dancing in under three minutes, or feeling bright and upbeat like a midday walk on the first day of spring — yet it still hits when you're having a good ol' car cry. \"Girl Feels Good\" is for sure one of my most-played songs of the year, followed closely by \"Eusexua,\" \"Perfect Stranger,\" \"Keep It, Hold It\" and \"Striptease.\" If ever I can't decide what I'm in the mood to listen to, I throw this album on and it doesn't disappoint. — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend EditorFaetooth - Labyrinthine Faetooth's sophomore album, Labyrinthine, is face-melting, melancholic perfection. The band describes its sound as \"fairy doom,\" but don't let that first word fool you into thinking it isn't heavy as hell. Labyrinthine goes unbelievably hard, and will have you feeling like you're eternally wandering a cursed bog, surrounded by the wailing of the unfortunate souls who came before you. Don't believe me? Put on \"White Noise.\" This is really an album that should be enjoyed in its entirety, though, and I can't individually name half the songs on it because I tend to just keep the whole thing playing on rotation. — C.M. Orville Peck - Appaloosa This EP is truly a testament to my ability to run my obsessions into the ground, because it only came out in mid-November and somehow landed on my most-listened wrapup for the end of the year… which was released some two weeks later. It's front-loaded with its strongest songs, a powerful and kind of haunting trio that just flows beautifully from one into the other: \"Dreaded Sundown,\" to \"Drift Away\" into \"Atchafalaya\" (ft. Noah Cyrus). As a fan of musicals, I also loved the inclusion of \"Maybe This Time,\" a cover from Cabaret, especially since I was pretty bummed to have missed Peck's stint as the Emcee in Cabaret on Broadway this summer. — C.M.Case 63 I got into an audio series kick this year, and dove into shows like Unicorn Girl, Stalked! and more. But none of the dramatized fiction I listened to in 2025 had me hooked like Case 63. Setting aside that it’s voice-acted by A-listers Julianne Moore and Oscar Isaac, which is a phenomenal pairing that won me over on star power alone. The best thing about Case 63 is its storytelling. Moore stars as a psychologist, meeting Isaac for the first time in a prison interview. Isaac has been claiming to be a traveler of sorts, and through recorded sessions and voice notes, we hear his side of the story, as well as her reactions and ultimate involvement in the adventures. Every step of the way, particularly in the beginning, there is clear explanation as to why the exchange is being recorded. It isn’t necessary, but it’s helpful in my buying into the realism of the story. It isn’t just the method and technical aspects of the storytelling, of course. Narratively, Case 63 is a gripping ride, and thanks to its short episodes, it’s easy to binge really quickly. There is certainly a generous use of cliffhangers to help speed things along, but I found myself eager to devour the entire series in one commute. The story continued to linger in my mind days after I finished both existing seasons, and I’m hoping the new one drops soon. If you’re looking for a quick and easy sci-fi audio series, do not miss Case 63. — Cherlynn Low, Managing EditorSecure Love I spent a lot of time this year trying to learn more about my attachment style and how it shows up in all the relationships in my life. Between Stephanie Rigg’s On Attachment podcast, the TV show Couples Therapy and all the books on the topic of attachment styles, trauma and more, I’ve consumed them all. And while they’ve all been helpful in different ways, one podcast stuck out to me this year. It’s hosted by Julie Menanno, MA, LMFT, LCPC, creator of the @TheSecureRelationship account on Instagram and the author of Secure Love: Create a relationship that lasts a lifetime. You can probably tell from that introduction what Menanno’s work is all about. Relationships, from the lens of attachment styles. The Secure Love Podcast doesn’t just re-deliver the same information we’ve seen published across various media and platforms, though. Each season of the podcast (it’s partway through the second as of this writing) sees Menanno work with one couple through their negative cycles, using somatic practices to help each partner understand their emotions, triggers and reactions. Because we’re listening to real people talk about real-life happenings, it’s not only easy to relate, but listeners often see themselves in these scenarios. At the start of each episode, too, Menanno reads out or plays notes from the audience, and you can see how fellow listeners have reacted. This season, for example, my friend and some other listeners seemed to really dislike Brian, the anxious male partner in this season’s pair. While I’ve certainly found some of Brian’s ways of speaking borderline offensive, I had a lot more sympathy for him as I started seeing his traits in my loved ones. I also started to identify with his partner Bethany, who Menanno typed as having an avoidant attachment style. As I listened to Bethany and Brian describe the reasons they got into fights and explain where they were coming from, suddenly it felt like the world made sense. I saw similar patterns and reasonings in my own relationship, as well as those of my parents, relatives and friends. It is slightly voyeuristic to listen to something so intimate, of course, but Menanno makes it all educational rather than just entertaining. She gently interrupts parts of each episode to tell the audience why she asks certain questions or what she’s attempting to achieve by asking Brian or Bethany to sit with their difficult feelings. I found her method familiar, as I recently started working with a somatic coach whose approach is similar to Menanno’s, which is rooted in emotion-focused therapy (EFT). Staying with uncomfortable feelings makes me want to jump out of my skin, but being able to endure them, question why they arise and then understand where they come from is crucial to helping uncover the thinking that causes them. Sometimes they’re the result of flawed logic, catastrophic thinking or a simple lack of context, but often they’re very reasonable reactions. If you’re looking to understand yourself and your emotions a bit better, or just want to get an idea of what EFT or couples therapy sounds like, I can’t recommend The Secure Love Podcast highly enough. — C.L.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/what-we-listened-to-in-2025-201308584.html?src=rss",

You can probably tell from that introduction what Menanno’s work is all about. Relationships, from the lens of attachment styles. The Secure Love Podcast doesn’t just re-deliver the same information we’ve seen published across various media and platforms, though. Each season of the podcast (it’s partway through the second as of this writing) sees Menanno work with one couple through their negative cycles, using somatic practices to help each partner understand their emotions, triggers and reactions. Because we’re listening to real people talk about real-life happenings, it’s not only easy to relate, but listeners often see themselves in these scenarios. At the start of each episode, too, Menanno reads out or plays notes from the audience, and you can see how fellow listeners have reacted. This season, for example, my friend and some other listeners seemed to really dislike Brian, the anxious male partner in this season’s pair. While I’ve certainly found some of Brian’s ways of speaking borderline offensive, I had a lot more sympathy for him as I started seeing his traits in my loved ones. I also started to identify with his partner Bethany, who Menanno typed as having an avoidant attachment style. As I listened to Bethany and Brian describe the reasons they got into fights and explain where they were coming from, suddenly it felt like the world made sense. I saw similar patterns and reasonings in my own relationship, as well as those of my parents, relatives and friends. It is slightly voyeuristic to listen to something so intimate, of course, but Menanno makes it all educational rather than just entertaining. She gently interrupts parts of each episode to tell the audience why she asks certain questions or what she’s attempting to achieve by asking Brian or Bethany to sit with their difficult feelings. I found her method familiar, as I recently started working with a somatic coach whose approach is similar to Menanno’s, which is rooted in emotion-focused therapy (EFT). Staying with uncomfortable feelings makes me want to jump out of my skin, but being able to endure them, question why they arise and then understand where they come from is crucial to helping uncover the thinking that causes them. Sometimes they’re the result of flawed logic, catastrophic thinking or a simple lack of context, but often they’re very reasonable reactions. If you’re looking to understand yourself and your emotions a bit better, or just want to get an idea of what EFT or couples therapy sounds like, I can’t recommend The Secure Love Podcast highly enough. — C.L.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/what-we-listened-to-in-2025-201308584.html?src=rss",

Whether it's a slim folio case, an Apple Pencil, a docking station or a paper-like screen protector, there are so many iPad accessories out there that can transform how you use your tablet on a regular basis — and make your iPad last longer, too. We've tested a plethora of accessories over the years, and these are the best iPad accessories you can get right now. Table of contents Which iPad generation do you own? iPad cases iPad stands and docks iPad keyboards and mice iPad stylus iPad chargers iPad screen protectors Which iPad generation do you own? Before you splurge on a bunch of accessories, you should double check which iPad generation you own. There are a couple of ways to do this: first, you can check the back of your tablet for its model number, which will start with an “A” and end with a series of numbers. You can also go into Settings on your iPad, then General and look up the model number in the top section. If you see a series of letters and numbers with a slash (“/“) in it, just tap that to reveal the iPad’s true model number. The most important iPad details to consider before buying accessories are the charging port, screen size and Apple Pencil compatibility. Most iPads now have USB-C charging, save for the now discontinued 9th-gen iPad that still requires a Lightning cable. Make sure to double check your iPad’s screen size before buying a folio for iPad or a screen protector — especially if you have the new iPad Air 11-inch.

Using a stylus on an iPad is strange at first because gliding the stylus nib over a glass surface feels nothing like “normal” writing. Matte screen protectors can get closer to replicating the pen-on-paper experience, and they also prevent the stylus nib from wearing down as quickly.

          "standfirst": "This was the kind of year that felt 100 years long, so who could blame us for leaning into a bit of escapism? Some of us buried our noses in books in 2025, and thankfully, there were plenty of good reads to get lost in. Here are some of the Engadget team’s top picks from the year.Wild Dark Shore by Charlotte McConaghyWild Dark Shore pulls off a magnificent balancing act of telling an intimate, personal story coupled with the backdrop of impending climate disaster. A father and two children are living on a remote island near Antarctica, taking care of a vast seed bank that was part of an abandoned research facility. They’re literally trying to stay above water for a few months until they get bailed out from the island along with as much of the seed bank as they can save before it goes under when a woman named Rowan washes up on shore. She survives, is nursed back to health, and starts forming bonds with her rescuers and their mission — but at the same time, she has some unexpected connections to the island and the former research team that lived there that she keeps to herself.The magic of this book is in the way Charlotte McConaghy builds tensions from many sources throughout the book; you feel a lingering sense of discomfort through, waiting for the other shoe to fall even as Rowan gets closer and closer to the family. It’s a small-scale story at its heart, but with the backdrop of disaster looming the stakes feel extremely high. And McConaghy is a master at putting these feelings on the page in gorgeous prose. As she showed in her previous work Migrations, she has a real talent for realistically describing near-future climate disasters, but Wild Dark Shore raises the personal stakes in a visceral way. — Nathan Ingraham, Deputy EditorMoonflow by Bitter Karella This book is a chaotic and deeply weird rollercoaster ride that repeatedly gave me whiplash, and I loved it. Fair warning, it's not for the weak-stomached. It is horrifying, hilarious, nauseating and somehow a very good time and a very bad time simultaneously. Moonflow is told through dual narratives, one following Sarah, a trans woman and mushroom dealer who has found herself in a desperate situation, and the other following the henchwomen of a deranged cult that's made its home in a cursed forest. After Sarah ventures into these woods in search of the King's Breakfast, a rare mushroom said to grant divine understanding to those who consume it, all hell breaks loose.Karella's writing is immersive, and this is the kind of book you can see, feel, hear and smell, for better and worse. Every person in this book is like a caricature of someone I've crossed paths with at some point in life, and the names of the cult members are just… chef's kiss. Some of them had me howling. It is completely unpredictable — except in those few moments where it seems the author wants you to know exactly where things are going just to make you dread the inevitable. Reading Moonflow was a visceral, unforgettable experience. — Cheyenne MacDonald, Weekend EditorSimplicity by Mattie LubchanskyAnother one about a cult, except this cult rules. I picked up Simplicity knowing nothing about it except that everyone cool on the internet seemed to be praising it, and was excited to discover that it's set near where I live in New York's Hudson Valley, in a future version of the Catskills. And here in the Hudson Valley, it often feels like I'm one or two innocuous decisions away from accidentally joining a cult, so there was an immediate connection. In Simplicity, it's the year 2081 and New York City is a high-tech dystopia run by a billionaire. North of the city, though, various communities have settled off-grid, including a group called The Spiritual Association of Peers.Lucius Pasternak, a trans man, is sent on an anthropological assignment from the mayor to SAP's compound, Simplicity, and it doesn't take long for their uninhibited way of life to start growing on him. But Lucius soon begins to have strange dreams, and a series of violent attacks shakes up the community. Through his mission to understand the people of SAP and later to find and stop the entity that's targeting them, a beautiful story about queerness and identity and belonging and fighting for what's important unfolds. This feels like the kind of book that should be passed around between friends who just get it, and I imagine many readers will feel incredibly seen by it like I did. — C.M. The Buffalo Hunter Hunter by Stephen Graham JonesOr Stephen Graham Jones' Interview with the Vampire. The Buffalo Hunter Hunter blends historical fiction and horror to give us one of the most impactful vampire novels of our time — one that serves as an uncomfortable but necessary reminder of the atrocities committed against indigenous people in the US by white settlers. It begins with the discovery of a crumbling journal that claims to contain the confession of a Blackfeet man-turned-vampire named Good Stab, as told to Lutheran pastor Arthur Beaucarne. What follows is a gutting chronicle of slaughter, heartbreak and revenge. It's a classic in the making. — C.M.Isola by Allegra GoodmanHistorical fiction is how I trick my brain into possibly learning something. And because the endings are set, the author has to hook you into the drama with more than just the peril of an unknown outcome. I fell deep into Wolf Hall even though I knew which heads Henry VIII chopped off. I thought Isola might be similarly gratifying. It tells the story of Marguerite de la Rocque de Roberval, a young noblewoman from France who was intentionally marooned on an island off the coast of Canada in 1542. The story is based on historical records so you know the plot won’t adhere to safe formulas, but mon dieu, I was not prepared for how rough things would be for Marguerite. Her troubles began long before she found herself fighting for survival on a wild uninhabited island with brutal winters. From birth, nearly every happiness was undercut by more dominant forces, yet the woman never stopped moving forward. Thankfully, Goodman draws Marguerite’s character not as some tired brand of plucky heroine with grit and a wink, but as a perceptive, pragmatic being who also gives in to impulse and doesn’t have everything figured out. Isola is beautifully rendered, from the stone chateaus to creaking ships and rough abundance of the island. Despite being set over 400 years ago, nothing feels dated. Human versus universe is an unfair battle, but I rooted for Marguerite on every page — and those pages turned quickly. — Amy Skorheim, Senior Reporter, Buying AdviceOld Soul by Susan BarkerThis was one of the first books I read this year, and it's really stuck with me. Old Soul travels through time and all over the world, across multiple storylines to trace the devastating impact of one mysterious woman who seems to defy the rules of mortality and always leave tragedy in her wake. Barker's writing in Old Soul pulls the reader in and doesn't let go. It's an unsettling slow burn that did a great job of getting under my skin. — C.M.Meet Me at the Crossroads by Megan GiddingsIf a door appeared out of nowhere, would you go through it not knowing what lies beyond or if you'd be able to return? In Meet Me at the Crossroads, seven doors pop up one day around the world, and people are unsurprisingly captivated by them. Regular people tempt fate, the ultra-wealthy plan exclusive excursions through them, religions form around their mystique. Ayanna is a teenager who was brought up in one of these religions. She's also a twin, with a sister named Olivia who she's been separated from after their parents' split. When it comes time for Ayanna to go through one of the doors as part of a ceremony, Olivia makes a last-second decision to go with her. What follows is the aftermath of that decision. Meet Me at the Crossroads is a haunting and emotional journey. — C.M.Woodworking by Emily St. JamesI am cisgender, white middle-aged man, so the experience of learning and accepting a different gender identity is something I will never fully understand. But Woodworking, the debut novel by Emily St. James, is a hilarious, tragic and ultimatley hopeful look at two trans women navigating different moments of acceptance in their lives. Erica is a mid-30s high school teacher who is recently divorced and just figuring out that she’s trans, something no one else knows about her at the start. Her student, 17-year-old Abigail, is her opposite: proudly out about her identity in a way that’s uncommon and dangerous in her small, conversative town in South Dakota. Their paths intersect, and Abigail ends up in the uncomfortable and somewhat unethical role of helping Erica find herself. After all she’s confident and not afraid of who she is — but she’s also still a teenager, one dealing with massive trauma of her own. The dual look into these two protagonists, each with sections of the book narrated from their own points of view, gave me a vivid picture of the different challlenges, emotions and dangers trans people face. But the unexpected community that develops around both characters plainly shows the value of living as your true self in a way that (hopefully) anyone should be able to relate to. — N.I.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/our-favorite-books-we-read-in-2025-160000704.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Losing AirPods happens to the best of us. They’re small, they slide into couch cushions and they love disappearing into bags or pockets when you least expect it. Luckily, Apple’s Find My system makes it easy to track down misplaced AirPods, whether you dropped the case somewhere or can’t find one of the individual earbuds. With the right settings enabled, your iPhone can show the last place they were connected, play a sound to help you hunt them down or even guide you with on-screen directions. Here’s how to use Find My to locate lost AirPods and how to track down the left or right earbud if only one has gone missing.How to use Find My to locate AirPodsIf your AirPods are paired with an Apple device linked to your Apple ID, they automatically appear in the Find My app. You don’t need to enable this manually, but you do need Bluetooth turned on during regular use so the system can refresh their location.Open the Find My app on your iPhone, iPad or Mac and go to the Devices tab. Your AirPods should appear in the list. If they’re online or recently connected to your device, Find My will show their current location on a map. If they’re offline, the app will show the last place they were detected, which can help narrow down where to start searching.For many people, this alone is enough to jog a memory. Find My might show your gym, a friend’s house or the bus stop where they slipped out of your pocket. If the location seems familiar, head there first and refresh the app once you arrive so it can update if the AirPods reconnect.If Find My says your AirPods are nearby but you still can’t see them, you can make them play a locating sound. Tap Play Sound in the device menu and the earbuds will emit a rising chirp that gets louder over a few seconds. This is especially helpful for finding AirPods hiding under blankets, inside bags or behind furniture.Keep in mind that AirPods need enough battery to make noise, and the charging case itself cannot play sound unless you have AirPods 4 (ANC), AirPods Pro 2, or AirPods Pro 3 that support that feature. If nothing plays, try refreshing the app or checking the last location again.AirPods models, like the AirPods Pro (2nd gen) and AirPods Pro (3rd gen) with MagSafe charging cases support Precision Finding. This feature uses the U1 chip inside your iPhone to show a directional arrow, distance estimate and haptic feedback as you get closer. Not all models have this feature, but if yours do, the Find My app will display a Find Nearby button.Follow the on-screen prompts and slowly rotate your phone. The iPhone will show when you’re walking in the right direction and tell you when you’re close enough to start looking under cushions or inside drawers.How to locate individual AirPodsAirPods have a habit of separating from each other, and losing only the left or right earbud may happen as frequently as misplacing the entire case. One of the most useful features in Find My is the ability to track each earbud individually. Here’s how to do it:Locate your AirPods in the Find My app and select the option to locate the Left or Right earbud.Select the earbud that’s missing. The map will update to show its location. If the missing bud has nearby location support, you can use Find Nearby to get directional guidance. If not, you can still use Play Sound, as long as it has enough battery.If Find My shows your lost earbud as Offline, you’ll still see its last known location. This can be enough to help you retrace your steps. Once you get within Bluetooth range again, the status may change to Online and let you use Play Sound.If you think the earbud is still somewhere in your home, try refreshing Find My while walking slowly from room to room. The device may reconnect once you get close enough.How to find a missing AirPods caseFinding the AirPods case is a little trickier because only newer models have support for sound playback or Precision Finding. If your case supports Find My, you’ll see options similar to locating the earbuds themselves. If it doesn’t, the app will only show the last place the case was connected.If your earbuds are in the case but the case is not supported by Find My, you may not be able to play sound until you open it or pull one of the earbuds out.Find My is a powerful tool for tracking down misplaced AirPods, and knowing how to use all of its features makes the search much easier. Whether you’re trying to find the entire set, one stray earbud or a case that wandered off, the app can lead you back to them with sound alerts, location markers and even directional guidance on supported models. With a few minutes of searching, you’ll usually have your AirPods back in your ears and your music playing again.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-find-lost-airpods-120000144.html?src=rss",

If the location seems familiar, head there first and refresh the app once you arrive so it can update if the AirPods reconnect.If Find My says your AirPods are nearby but you still can’t see them, you can make them play a locating sound. Tap Play Sound in the device menu and the earbuds will emit a rising chirp that gets louder over a few seconds. This is especially helpful for finding AirPods hiding under blankets, inside bags or behind furniture.Keep in mind that AirPods need enough battery to make noise, and the charging case itself cannot play sound unless you have AirPods 4 (ANC), AirPods Pro 2, or AirPods Pro 3 that support that feature. If nothing plays, try refreshing the app or checking the last location again.AirPods models, like the AirPods Pro (2nd gen) and AirPods Pro (3rd gen) with MagSafe charging cases support Precision Finding. This feature uses the U1 chip inside your iPhone to show a directional arrow, distance estimate and haptic feedback as you get closer. Not all models have this feature, but if yours do, the Find My app will display a Find Nearby button.Follow the on-screen prompts and slowly rotate your phone. The iPhone will show when you’re walking in the right direction and tell you when you’re close enough to start looking under cushions or inside drawers.How to locate individual AirPodsAirPods have a habit of separating from each other, and losing only the left or right earbud may happen as frequently as misplacing the entire case. One of the most useful features in Find My is the ability to track each earbud individually. Here’s how to do it:Locate your AirPods in the Find My app and select the option to locate the Left or Right earbud.Select the earbud that’s missing. The map will update to show its location. If the missing bud has nearby location support, you can use Find Nearby to get directional guidance. If not, you can still use Play Sound, as long as it has enough battery.If Find My shows your lost earbud as Offline, you’ll still see its last known location. This can be enough to help you retrace your steps. Once you get within Bluetooth range again, the status may change to Online and let you use Play Sound.If you think the earbud is still somewhere in your home, try refreshing Find My while walking slowly from room to room. The device may reconnect once you get close enough.How to find a missing AirPods caseFinding the AirPods case is a little trickier because only newer models have support for sound playback or Precision Finding. If your case supports Find My, you’ll see options similar to locating the earbuds themselves. If it doesn’t, the app will only show the last place the case was connected.If your earbuds are in the case but the case is not supported by Find My, you may not be able to play sound until you open it or pull one of the earbuds out.Find My is a powerful tool for tracking down misplaced AirPods, and knowing how to use all of its features makes the search much easier. Whether you’re trying to find the entire set, one stray earbud or a case that wandered off, the app can lead you back to them with sound alerts, location markers and even directional guidance on supported models. With a few minutes of searching, you’ll usually have your AirPods back in your ears and your music playing again.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/how-to-find-lost-airpods-120000144.html?src=rss",

I also bought and used our top pick in my own PS5. PS5 SSD FAQs How much PS5 storage do I need? The PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro can accept internal drives with between 250GB and 8TB of storage capacity. If you already own a PS5, chances are you have a reasonable idea of how much storage you need ​​for your game library. If you’re buying an SSD with a new PS5 or PS5 Pro, or buying for someone else, it’s more difficult to tell what you might need for a high-performance experience. PS5 games are smaller on average than their PS4 equivalents, typically taking up between 30GB and 100GB, with some notable (and very popular) exceptions. If you’re a fan of the Call of Duty series, installing Black Ops 6 and Warzone 2.0 can eat up to 240GB. In other words, a full Call of Duty install will take up more than one-third of the PS5’s internal storage. If you’re not a CoD fan, though, chances are you’ll be good to store between six to 10 games on a regular PS5 internally before running into problems. You also need to consider your internet speed. If you live in an area with slow broadband, the “you can just download it again” rationale doesn’t really work. At my old home, a 100GB download took me around eight hours, during which time it was difficult to simultaneously watch Twitch or, say, publish articles about upgrading PS5 SSDs. Keeping games around on the off-chance you’ll want to play them at some point makes sense. Aaron Souppouris / Engadget Off the bat, there's basically no point in going for a 250GB PS5 SSD. Economically, 250GB drives aren’t that much cheaper than 500GB ones — and practically, that really isn’t a lot of space for modern games to live on. 500GB drives can be a decent option, but after years of declining prices, I think the sweet spot for most people is to opt for a high-capacity 1TB or 2TB drive, which should run you at most $200. The latter will more than double the PS5 Pro’s storage without breaking the bank. Unless you’re rolling in cash and want to flex, 4TB and 8TB models should mostly be avoided, as you’ll end up paying more per gigabyte than you would with a 1TB or 2TB drive. While the 825GB PS5 only provides 667GB of storage, that’s largely due to storage being reserved for the operating system and caching. If you install a 1TB PS5 SSD, you'll have, within a margin of error, 1TB of storage available for games. Out of the box, the PS5 Pro offers 1.86TB of storage for games, though you can eke out more if you delete the pre-installed Astro’s Playroom (gasp). Since neither the PS5 Slim nor PS5 Pro feature updated CPU architecture, all of our recommendations will work with whatever PS5 model you own. Can you play PS5 games on an external SSD? External hard drives tend to cost less than internal SSD counterparts (and there’s a good chance you might own one already). Unfortunately, there are restrictions on what you can do with them. An external SSD connects to your PS5 via USB, and is only suitable for playing PlayStation 4 games, or storing PS5 titles. That’s useful if you have anything but the best high-speed internet — it’s faster to move a PS5 game out of “cold storage” on an external drive than it is to re-download it — or want to keep your PS4 library on hand. Due to the limitations here, you don’t need the highest-performing model, although you should opt for SSDs over HDDs for improved transfer speeds and load times. Any basic portable drive from a reputable brand will do, with the Crucial X9 Pro and Samsung T7 being options we’ve tried and can recommend. Which SSD cards are compatible with the PS5? The official answer to this question is an “M.2 Socket 3 (Key M) Gen4 x4 NVME SSD.” But even within that seemingly specific description, there are additional factors to consider. The main requirements Sony has laid out for compatibility come down to speed, cooling and physical dimensions. For speed, Sony says drives should be able to handle sequential reads at 5,500MB/s. Early testing showed that the PS5 would accept drives as slow as 4,800MB/s, and that games that tap into the SSD regularly — such as Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart — would cause no issues. Pretty much the only thing the PS5 will outright reject is one that doesn't match the Gen4 x4 spec. In our opinion, though, using a drive slower than the specification is a risk that, if you don’t already have that drive lying around, is not worth taking. Just because we haven’t found issues yet doesn’t mean there won’t be games that could be problematic in the future. The price difference between these marginally slower Gen4 drives and the ones that meet Sony’s spec isn’t huge, and you might as well cover all your bases. Slightly more complicated than speed is cooling and size. Most new SSDs are going to be just fine; the PS5 can fit 22mm-wide SSDs of virtually any length (30mm, 40mm, 60mm, 80mm or 110mm, to be precise). The vast majority of drives you find will be 22mm wide and 80mm long, so no problem there. It should be noted that the system can fit a 25mm-wide drive, but that width must include the cooling solution. Speaking of, Sony says SSDs require “effective heat dissipation with a cooling structure, such as a heatsink.” The maximum height supported by Sony’s slot is 11.25mm, of which only 2.45mm can be “below” the drive. This previously meant some of the most popular heatsinked Gen4 SSDs, including Corsair’s MP600 Pro LP, would not fit within the PS5’s storage expansion slot. Since Engadget first published this guide in 2021, most NVMe makers, including Samsung, have come out with PlayStation-specific models that meet those requirements. That said, if you want to save some money, bare drives are often cheaper and it’s trivial to find a cooling solution that will work for the PS5. The only component in an NVMe SSD that really requires cooling is the controller, which without a heatsink will happily sear a (very small) steak. Most SSDs have chips on only one side, but even on double-sided SSDs, the controller is likely to be on top, as manufacturers know it needs to be positioned there to better dissipate heat. So, head to your PC component seller of choice and pick up basically anything that meets the recommended dimensions. A good search term is “laptop NVME heatsink,” as these will be designed to fit in the confines of gaming laptops, which are even more restrictive than a PS5. They’re also typically cheaper than the ones labeled as “PS5 heatsinks.” One recommendation is this $6 copper heatsink, which attaches to the PS5 SSD with sticky thermal interface material. It works just fine, and in performing stress tests on a PC, we couldn’t find anything metal that didn’t keep temperatures under control. When you’re searching, just make sure the solution you go for measures no more than 25mm wide or 8mm tall (including the thermal interface material) and has a simple method of installation that’s not going to cause any headaches. One last thing: When shopping for a PS5 NVMe, there’s no reason to buy a Gen5 model over a more affordable Gen4 model. As things stand, Sony’s console can’t take advantage of the new standard, and though Gen5 drives are backward compatible, they’re more expensive than their Gen4 counterparts. Just buy the fastest and highest-capacity Gen4 model you can afford. How to install an SSD into your PS5 If you need guidance on how to install your new NVMe into your PS5 or PS5 Pro, we have a separate guide detailing all the steps here. Installation is pretty straightforward, but our how-to can help you if you're stuck. Just make note: Before attempting to add more storage via a PS5 SSD, ensure that you have Sony’s latest software installed.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/best-ssd-for-ps5-130004175.html?src=rss",

          "title": "The best microSD cards for the Nintendo Switch 2",
          "standfirst": "If you want to expand the storage of your Nintendo Switch 2, you’ll need a microSD Express card. This is not the same as the more traditional microSD cards you may have bought for the original Switch or other gaming handhelds; Express cards are newer, faster and significantly more expensive on average. But they’re your only choice, and given how much space certain Switch 2 games chew up, you’ll probably have no choice but to get one eventually. Which to buy, though? If you’re looking for the best microSD card for the Switch 2 today, we’ve broken down what you should know before taking the plunge. The best microSD cards for the Switch 2 (aren't all that important) Jeff Dunn for Engadget The Switch 2 is the first mainstream device to require microSD Express for storage expansion, so there aren’t many options available to buy just yet. Of the handful of compatible models released thus far, we’ve now tested seven: the SanDisk microSD Express Card (aka the “SanDisk GamePlay microSD Express Card” at Walmart), the Lexar Play Pro, the Samsung microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2, the Samsung P9 Express, the PNY microSD Express Card, the GameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 and the Onn microSD Express Card. The first five are made by genuine storage manufacturers, while the GameStop and Onn cards appear to be rebadged versions of other models. We used the 256GB version of every card except for Lexar Play Pro, which was 1TB. After timing these microSD Express cards across a range of Switch 2 games, our advice is simple: Get whichever one is in stock for the lowest price in the capacity you want. They aren’t identically fast, especially if you want to move a game to the card from the console’s internal storage (or vice versa). But the differences in load times and overall performance within actual games are tough to notice unless you have a stopwatch handy. All five cards loaded up the digital version of Mario Kart World, for instance, between 18 and 20 seconds. Each loaded the first Grand Prix race in about 6.5 seconds. Getting to the start screen of Cyberpunk 2077 took about 38 or 39 seconds in each case. Loading a save in a particularly asset-heavy area (Jig-Jig Street) then took between 26 and 29 seconds, depending on the card. (The one exception was with the Onn card, which averaged closer to 31 seconds with that particular task, though that’s also the cheapest choice.) With Fast Fusion, a smaller native Switch 2 game, the initial load always took six to seven seconds, while each card loaded the first championship race in roughly 4 seconds. It was a similar situation with the Switch 2 upgrade for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (using a Switch 1 cartridge): Each card took just over six seconds to get to the start screen, between 19 and 20 seconds to load a save just before the final boss, about 16 seconds to fast travel between Kakariko Village and Korok Forest, and so on. We saw no significant issues with in-game loads when playing each game, either. The SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro. Jeff Dunn for Engadget All of this suggests that the Switch 2 has a relatively specific target for these cards to hit, and that there may not be much room for one model to leap too far out in front of the others. We’ll also note that the console’s built-in storage was consistently faster than any external option: The gap wasn’t always big, but no card truly outpaced it in any of our tests. Loading that demanding area in Cyberpunk, for example, took about 22.5 seconds on average. So if you want the absolute fastest load times, don’t put your game on a card at all. If you need the mental comfort of knowing you technically have the best card available, get the SanDisk microSD Express Card. It had no outliers across our many game loading tests, and it was consistently right near the top when it came to moving games to and from system storage, which means it offers strong sequential read and write performance. Benchmark testing on PC with tools like CrystalDiskMark backed this up, as noted in our broader microSD card buying guide. Putting Mario Kart (a 21.9GB file) on that card took four minutes and 39 seconds on average, which was only second to the Lexar Play Pro by six seconds. It was the fastest to write Fast Fusion (3.5GB), taking an average of 27 seconds across three runs. Only PNY’s card was faster to move games back to the console’s storage, but that one was far slower at writing games to the card — getting Mario Kart on there took seven minutes and 11 seconds on average. Just note that the 128GB version of SanDisk’s card has slower sequential writes than the larger versions, including much slower sustained write speeds (100 MB/s vs 210-220 MB/s). So transferring a game to that particular model will take much longer. The Onn card was also slower to move games back to system storage, taking about 50 seconds more than the SanDisk with Mario Kart and nearly three minutes longer with Cyberpunk. Practically speaking, though, speed differences aren’t as important in this case as having lots of space to hold games at a price you can live with. To make things easy, we’ve listed every Express card we’ve seen at retailers at the time of writing below. Remember: You want microSD Express, not “Extreme,” like the branding SanDisk uses for some conventional microSD cards. A microSD Express card will have a big “EX” logo printed on it. 128GB SanDisk microSD Express Card ($64 MSRP) PNY microSD Express Card ($48 MSRP) 256GB Samsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($60 MSRP) Samsung P9 Express ($55 MSRP) SanDisk microSD Express Card ($78 MSRP) Lexar Play Pro ($60 MSRP) PNY microSD Express Card ($62 MSRP) GameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($60 MSRP) Onn microSD Express Card ($47 MSRP) 512GB Samsung P9 Express ($100 MSRP) SanDisk microSD Express Card ($128 MSRP) Lexar Play Pro ($120 MSRP) PNY microSD Express Card ($124 MSRP) GameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($100 MSRP) Onn microSD Express Card ($85 MSRP) 1TB Lexar Play Pro ($220 MSRP) GameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($190 MSRP) All microSD Express cards will have this \"EX\" logo printed on them. Nintendo/Engadget As you can see, while the SanDisk card is fast, it’s also the most expensive of an already-pricey bunch. Is it worth an extra $10-20 to shave a couple seconds off certain loads in certain games, or a couple minutes when moving a game to external storage? Probably not for most people. But stock for all of these cards has been a bit patchy since the Switch 2 landed, particularly for the Walmart Onn model, which has typically been the cheapest choice. More recently, the GameStop-branded cards seem to have sold out too. If only one card is actually available by the time you read this — and you must have it today — it’s safe to just get it. You won’t lose or gain all that much when it comes to real-world performance. We’ve recommended holding off on buying a microSD Express card for as long as possible in previous updates to this guide, and ultimately each model above should still come down in price over time. We saw multiple Express card discounts during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, for instance. But between President Trump’s tariff hikes and the ongoing AI-driven shortages for memory and high-capacity storage, you’d be justified if you wanted to grab the largest card you can reasonably afford sooner rather than later. These things are still pricey compared to traditional microSD cards: The Samsung Pro Plus, for example, costs $17 for 128GB, $27 for 256GB, $50 for 512GB and $95 for 1TB as of this writing. And ideally, we’ll see more high-capacity options down the road: Nintendo says the Switch 2 technically supports cards up to 2TB, but so far only a couple even go up to 1TB. You should still try to use all 256GB baked into the Switch 2 first, even if it means having to delete a game or two. But if you absolutely need more space right away, the cards above should be fine today. What are microSD Express cards? A microSD Express card like the one on the right has a second row of pins on the back. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Most microSD cards are based on a standard called Ultra High Speed (UHS), of which there are three versions: UHS-I, UHS-II and UHS-III. The vast majority of cards you may have bought in the past utilize UHS-I. These have one row of pins in the back and a theoretical maximum data transfer speed of 104 megabytes per second (MB/s). (Though many cards are able to surpass that limit with proprietary tech and card readers.) The original Switch has a UHS-I microSD slot, as do most other gaming handhelds like Valve’s Steam Deck. UHS-II cards add a second row of pins and can reach up to 312 MB/s. These are pricier and much less common than cards based on UHS-I, but they’re supported by some cameras and higher-power handhelds like the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X. UHS-III, meanwhile, is twice as fast as UHS-II in theory (624 MB/s), but no microSD cards have actually used it. UHS-I cards have held on over the years because they’re cheap, widely supported and fast enough for the things most people need them to do: record 4K video, stash photos and so on. But with the Switch 2, Nintendo needs more. The new console is dramatically more powerful, which allows it to run demanding games that may have originally been built for stronger hardware like the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X or gaming PCs. The device also uses UFS 3.1 storage internally, which is much speedier than the eMMC storage used by the original Switch. (A custom file decompression engine helps improve load times as well.) So if the Switch 2 is going to accept microSD cards, it needs ones that won’t bring a serious drop-off in performance and can hold up with modern games. The Nintendo Switch 2. Sam Rutherford for Engadget Hence, SD Express. This standard has technically been around since 2018 but mostly went nowhere until the Switch 2 came along. It also uses a second row of pins, but it lets microSD cards take advantage of the PCI Express (PCIe)/NVMe interface, which is the same underlying tech used by modern SSDs. As a result, it can produce considerably faster read and write speeds, with a current theoretical maximum of 985 MB/s. As noted above, real-world performance won’t be quite that fast. Even if it was, the best microSD Express cards would still be much slower than the NVMe SSDs used by the PS5 and Xbox. (Sony recommends SSDs with sequential read speeds of at least 5,500 MB/s.) And they’ll fall well below their peak speeds under sustained loads: SanDisk, for instance, says sustained write speeds for its 128GB Express card can drop as low as 100 MB/s. But they’re still a marked improvement over old UHS-I cards, and in theory, they should be quicker than some older SATA-based SSDs when it comes loading game levels, asset streaming, retrieving saves or copying games to external storage. Whereas SanDisk’s microSD Express card can produce sequential read speeds around 900 MB/s, Lexar’s Professional Silver Plus — the top UHS-I pick in our general microSD card guide — topped out just over 200 MB/s, and that’s with a proprietary reader. (On the first Switch, it’d be closer to 100 MB/s.) Sequential writes and random speeds were three to four times better as well, and sometimes even more depending on the benchmark we used. It remains to be seen how well these Express cards will hold up with years of use, and there’s no way to know exactly when their sky-high prices will drop. Non-Switch 2 devices that support microSD Express are still exceedingly rare, and the standard itself isn’t backwards compatible with UHS-II, so you’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds if you want to use your card with another device (unless you buy a pricey external reader). Still, while the increased costs and limited selection are annoying, the tech itself is worthy of a next-gen Switch. How we test microSD Express cards Jeff Dunn for Engadget We put our microSD Express cards through a series of tests meant to simulate how people would use each card on the Switch 2 in the real world. We mainly worked with four games: a mid-sized title in Mario Kart World, a small one in Fast Fusion, a relatively large one in Cyberpunk 2077 and a hybrid in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which ran off a Switch 1 cartridge but used a roughly 10GB Switch 2 upgrade pack that was downloaded and installed digitally. We first timed how long it took to move each game from the system’s internal storage to the card in question, and vice versa. We then timed how long it took to load each game when installed to a given card. After that, we measured how quickly the cards could load certain in-game scenarios: the first Grand Prix race in Mario Kart; the first championship race in Fast Fusion; fast traveling between the Jig-Jig Street, Embers and Downtown Central areas in Cyberpunk and fast traveling between the Kakariko Village, Korok Forest and the Hyrule Castle Town Ruins areas in Zelda. (We chose those places in the latter two games because they’re more taxing than other regions.) With Cyberpunk and Zelda, we also timed how long it took to load up different save files in those locations. With each test, we completed three to five runs to account for any irregularities and marked down the average time taken between them. We did each test in airplane mode, with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth off, to minimize any performance drain that could arise from background downloads. Between each test, we also spent at least an hour playing the games off each card to ensure there were no significant drop-offs compared to the console’s built-in storage. Recent updates December 2025: We’ve tested Samsung’s P9 Express card, though our general shopping advice for this market remains the same. November 2025: We’ve tested the 256GB version of Walmart’s Onn microSD Express card and edited our guide accordingly. It’s generally slower than most of the other options we’ve tried, especially when moving games to and from system storage, and in synthetic benchmark tests on a PC. But the performance drop-off isn’t particularly noticeable in actual Switch 2 games, so if you see it in stock and just want to pay as little as possible, it’s a decent buy. September 2025: We’ve taken another pass through this guide to confirm our advice is still accurate. We’ve also noted a new 512GB version of PNY’s microSD Express card and confirmed that a “SanDisk GamePlay” Express card sold at Walmart has the same performance as the standard SanDisk model we recommend above, just with a different name.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html?src=rss",
          "content": "If you want to expand the storage of your Nintendo Switch 2, you’ll need a microSD Express card. This is not the same as the more traditional microSD cards you may have bought for the original Switch or other gaming handhelds; Express cards are newer, faster and significantly more expensive on average. But they’re your only choice, and given how much space certain Switch 2 games chew up, you’ll probably have no choice but to get one eventually. Which to buy, though? If you’re looking for the best microSD card for the Switch 2 today, we’ve broken down what you should know before taking the plunge. The best microSD cards for the Switch 2 (aren't all that important) Jeff Dunn for Engadget The Switch 2 is the first mainstream device to require microSD Express for storage expansion, so there aren’t many options available to buy just yet. Of the handful of compatible models released thus far, we’ve now tested seven: the SanDisk microSD Express Card (aka the “SanDisk GamePlay microSD Express Card” at Walmart), the Lexar Play Pro, the Samsung microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2, the Samsung P9 Express, the PNY microSD Express Card, the GameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 and the Onn microSD Express Card. The first five are made by genuine storage manufacturers, while the GameStop and Onn cards appear to be rebadged versions of other models. We used the 256GB version of every card except for Lexar Play Pro, which was 1TB. After timing these microSD Express cards across a range of Switch 2 games, our advice is simple: Get whichever one is in stock for the lowest price in the capacity you want. They aren’t identically fast, especially if you want to move a game to the card from the console’s internal storage (or vice versa). But the differences in load times and overall performance within actual games are tough to notice unless you have a stopwatch handy. All five cards loaded up the digital version of Mario Kart World, for instance, between 18 and 20 seconds. Each loaded the first Grand Prix race in about 6.5 seconds. Getting to the start screen of Cyberpunk 2077 took about 38 or 39 seconds in each case. Loading a save in a particularly asset-heavy area (Jig-Jig Street) then took between 26 and 29 seconds, depending on the card. (The one exception was with the Onn card, which averaged closer to 31 seconds with that particular task, though that’s also the cheapest choice.) With Fast Fusion, a smaller native Switch 2 game, the initial load always took six to seven seconds, while each card loaded the first championship race in roughly 4 seconds. It was a similar situation with the Switch 2 upgrade for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (using a Switch 1 cartridge): Each card took just over six seconds to get to the start screen, between 19 and 20 seconds to load a save just before the final boss, about 16 seconds to fast travel between Kakariko Village and Korok Forest, and so on. We saw no significant issues with in-game loads when playing each game, either. The SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro. Jeff Dunn for Engadget All of this suggests that the Switch 2 has a relatively specific target for these cards to hit, and that there may not be much room for one model to leap too far out in front of the others. We’ll also note that the console’s built-in storage was consistently faster than any external option: The gap wasn’t always big, but no card truly outpaced it in any of our tests. Loading that demanding area in Cyberpunk, for example, took about 22.5 seconds on average. So if you want the absolute fastest load times, don’t put your game on a card at all. If you need the mental comfort of knowing you technically have the best card available, get the SanDisk microSD Express Card. It had no outliers across our many game loading tests, and it was consistently right near the top when it came to moving games to and from system storage, which means it offers strong sequential read and write performance. Benchmark testing on PC with tools like CrystalDiskMark backed this up, as noted in our broader microSD card buying guide. Putting Mario Kart (a 21.9GB file) on that card took four minutes and 39 seconds on average, which was only second to the Lexar Play Pro by six seconds. It was the fastest to write Fast Fusion (3.5GB), taking an average of 27 seconds across three runs. Only PNY’s card was faster to move games back to the console’s storage, but that one was far slower at writing games to the card — getting Mario Kart on there took seven minutes and 11 seconds on average. Just note that the 128GB version of SanDisk’s card has slower sequential writes than the larger versions, including much slower sustained write speeds (100 MB/s vs 210-220 MB/s). So transferring a game to that particular model will take much longer. The Onn card was also slower to move games back to system storage, taking about 50 seconds more than the SanDisk with Mario Kart and nearly three minutes longer with Cyberpunk. Practically speaking, though, speed differences aren’t as important in this case as having lots of space to hold games at a price you can live with. To make things easy, we’ve listed every Express card we’ve seen at retailers at the time of writing below. Remember: You want microSD Express, not “Extreme,” like the branding SanDisk uses for some conventional microSD cards. A microSD Express card will have a big “EX” logo printed on it. 128GB SanDisk microSD Express Card ($64 MSRP) PNY microSD Express Card ($48 MSRP) 256GB Samsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($60 MSRP) Samsung P9 Express ($55 MSRP) SanDisk microSD Express Card ($78 MSRP) Lexar Play Pro ($60 MSRP) PNY microSD Express Card ($62 MSRP) GameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($60 MSRP) Onn microSD Express Card ($47 MSRP) 512GB Samsung P9 Express ($100 MSRP) SanDisk microSD Express Card ($128 MSRP) Lexar Play Pro ($120 MSRP) PNY microSD Express Card ($124 MSRP) GameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($100 MSRP) Onn microSD Express Card ($85 MSRP) 1TB Lexar Play Pro ($220 MSRP) GameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2 ($190 MSRP) All microSD Express cards will have this \"EX\" logo printed on them. Nintendo/Engadget As you can see, while the SanDisk card is fast, it’s also the most expensive of an already-pricey bunch. Is it worth an extra $10-20 to shave a couple seconds off certain loads in certain games, or a couple minutes when moving a game to external storage? Probably not for most people. But stock for all of these cards has been a bit patchy since the Switch 2 landed, particularly for the Walmart Onn model, which has typically been the cheapest choice. More recently, the GameStop-branded cards seem to have sold out too. If only one card is actually available by the time you read this — and you must have it today — it’s safe to just get it. You won’t lose or gain all that much when it comes to real-world performance. We’ve recommended holding off on buying a microSD Express card for as long as possible in previous updates to this guide, and ultimately each model above should still come down in price over time. We saw multiple Express card discounts during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, for instance. But between President Trump’s tariff hikes and the ongoing AI-driven shortages for memory and high-capacity storage, you’d be justified if you wanted to grab the largest card you can reasonably afford sooner rather than later. These things are still pricey compared to traditional microSD cards: The Samsung Pro Plus, for example, costs $17 for 128GB, $27 for 256GB, $50 for 512GB and $95 for 1TB as of this writing. And ideally, we’ll see more high-capacity options down the road: Nintendo says the Switch 2 technically supports cards up to 2TB, but so far only a couple even go up to 1TB. You should still try to use all 256GB baked into the Switch 2 first, even if it means having to delete a game or two. But if you absolutely need more space right away, the cards above should be fine today. What are microSD Express cards? A microSD Express card like the one on the right has a second row of pins on the back. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Most microSD cards are based on a standard called Ultra High Speed (UHS), of which there are three versions: UHS-I, UHS-II and UHS-III. The vast majority of cards you may have bought in the past utilize UHS-I. These have one row of pins in the back and a theoretical maximum data transfer speed of 104 megabytes per second (MB/s). (Though many cards are able to surpass that limit with proprietary tech and card readers.) The original Switch has a UHS-I microSD slot, as do most other gaming handhelds like Valve’s Steam Deck. UHS-II cards add a second row of pins and can reach up to 312 MB/s. These are pricier and much less common than cards based on UHS-I, but they’re supported by some cameras and higher-power handhelds like the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X. UHS-III, meanwhile, is twice as fast as UHS-II in theory (624 MB/s), but no microSD cards have actually used it. UHS-I cards have held on over the years because they’re cheap, widely supported and fast enough for the things most people need them to do: record 4K video, stash photos and so on. But with the Switch 2, Nintendo needs more. The new console is dramatically more powerful, which allows it to run demanding games that may have originally been built for stronger hardware like the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X or gaming PCs.

          "standfirst": "For the past year, enterprise decision-makers have faced a rigid architectural trade-off in voice AI: adopt a \"Native\" speech-to-speech (S2S) model for speed and emotional fidelity, or stick with a \"Modular\" stack for control and auditability. That binary choice has evolved into distinct market segmentation, driven by two simultaneous forces reshaping the landscape.What was once a performance decision has become a governance and compliance decision, as voice agents move from pilots into regulated, customer-facing workflows.On one side, Google has commoditized the \"raw intelligence\" layer. With the release of Gemini 2.5 Flash and now Gemini 3.0 Flash, Google has positioned itself as the high-volume utility provider with pricing that makes voice automation economically viable for workflows previously too cheap to justify. OpenAI responded in August with a 20% price cut on its Realtime API, narrowing the gap with Gemini to roughly 2x — still meaningful, but no longer insurmountable.On the other side, a new \"Unified\" modular architecture is emerging. By physically co-locating the disparate components of a voice stack-transcription, reasoning and synthesis-providers like Together AI are addressing the latency issues that previously hampered modular designs. This architectural counter-attack delivers native-like speed while retaining the audit trails and intervention points that regulated industries require.Together, these forces are collapsing the historical trade-off between speed and control in enterprise voice systems.For enterprise executives, the question is no longer just about model performance. It&#x27;s a strategic choice between a cost-efficient, generalized utility model and a domain-specific, vertically integrated stack that supports compliance requirements — including whether voice agents can be deployed at scale without introducing audit gaps, regulatory risk, or downstream liability.Understanding the three architectural pathsThese architectural differences are not academic; they directly shape latency, auditability, and the ability to intervene in live voice interactions.The enterprise voice AI market has consolidated around three distinct architectures, each optimized for different trade-offs between speed, control, and cost. S2S models — including Google&#x27;s Gemini Live and OpenAI&#x27;s Realtime API — process audio inputs natively to preserve paralinguistic signals like tone and hesitation. But contrary to popular belief, these aren&#x27;t true end-to-end speech models. They operate as what the industry calls \"Half-Cascades\": Audio understanding happens natively, but the model still performs text-based reasoning before synthesizing speech output. This hybrid approach achieves latency in the 200 to 300ms range, closely mimicking human response times where pauses beyond 200ms become perceptible and feel unnatural. The trade-off is that these intermediate reasoning steps remain opaque to enterprises, limiting auditability and policy enforcement.Traditional chained pipelines represent the opposite extreme. These modular stacks follow a three-step relay: Speech-to-text engines like Deepgram&#x27;s Nova-3 or AssemblyAI&#x27;s Universal-Streaming transcribe audio into text, an LLM generates a response, and text-to-speech providers like ElevenLabs or Cartesia&#x27;s Sonic synthesize the output. Each handoff introduces network transmission time plus processing overhead. While individual components have optimized their processing times to sub-300ms, the aggregate roundtrip latency frequently exceeds 500ms, triggering \"barge-in\" collisions where users interrupt because they assume the agent hasn&#x27;t heard them. Unified infrastructure represents the architectural counter-attack from modular vendors. Together AI physically co-locates STT (Whisper Turbo), LLM (Llama/Mixtral), and TTS models (Rime, Cartesia) on the same GPU clusters. Data moves between components via high-speed memory interconnects rather than the public internet, collapsing total latency to sub-500ms while retaining the modular separation that enterprises require for compliance. Together AI benchmarks TTS latency at approximately 225ms using Mist v2, leaving sufficient headroom for transcription and reasoning within the 500ms budget that defines natural conversation. This architecture delivers the speed of a native model with the control surface of a modular stack — which can be the \"Goldilocks\" solution that addresses both performance and governance requirements simultaneously.The trade-off is increased operational complexity compared to fully managed native systems, but for regulated enterprises that complexity often maps directly to required control.Why latency determines user tolerance — and the metrics that prove itThe difference between a successful voice interaction and an abandoned call often comes down to milliseconds. A single extra second of delay can cut user satisfaction by 16%. Three technical metrics define production readiness:Time to first token (TTFT) measures the delay from the end of user speech to the start of the agent&#x27;s response. Human conversation tolerates roughly 200ms gaps; anything longer feels robotic. Native S2S models achieve 200 to 300ms, while modular stacks must optimize aggressively to stay under 500ms.Word Error Rate (WER) measures transcription accuracy. Deepgram’s Nova-3 delivers 53.4% lower WER for streaming, while AssemblyAI&#x27;s Universal-Streaming claims 41% faster word emission latency. A single transcription error — \"billing\" misheard as \"building\" — corrupts the entire downstream reasoning chain.Real-Time Factor (RTF) measures whether the system processes speech faster than users speak. An RTF below 1.0 is mandatory to prevent lag accumulation. Whisper Turbo runs 5.4x faster than Whisper Large v3, making sub-1.0 RTF achievable at scale without proprietary APIs.The modular advantage: Control and complianceFor regulated industries like healthcare and finance, \"cheap\" and \"fast\" are secondary to governance. Native S2S models function as \"black boxes,\" making it difficult to audit what the model processed before responding. Without visibility into the intermediate steps, enterprises can&#x27;t verify that sensitive data was properly handled or that the agent followed required protocols. These controls are difficult — and in some cases impossible — to implement inside opaque, end-to-end speech systems.The modular approach, on the other hand, maintains a text layer between transcription and synthesis, enabling stateful interventions impossible with end-to-end audio processing. Some use cases include:PII redaction allows compliance engines to scan intermediate text and strip out credit card numbers, patient names, or Social Security numbers before they enter the reasoning model. Retell AI&#x27;s automatic redaction of sensitive personal data from transcripts significantly lowers compliance risk — a feature that Vapi does not natively offer.Memory injection lets enterprises inject domain knowledge or user history into the prompt context before the LLM generates a response, transforming agents from transactional tools into relationship-based systems. Pronunciation authority becomes critical in regulated industries where mispronouncing a drug name or financial term creates liability. Rime&#x27;s Mist v2 focuses on deterministic pronunciation, allowing enterprises to define pronunciation dictionaries that are rigorously adhered to across millions of calls — a capability that native S2S models struggle to guarantee.Architecture comparison matrixThe table below summarizes how each architecture optimizes for a different definition of “production-ready.”FeatureNative S2S (Half-Cascade)Unified Modular (Co-located)Legacy Modular (Chained)Leading PlayersGoogle Gemini 2.5, OpenAI RealtimeTogether AI, Vapi (On-prem)Deepgram + Anthropic + ElevenLabsLatency (TTFT)~200-300ms (Human-level) ~300-500ms (Near-native) >500ms (Noticeable Lag) Cost ProfileBifurcated: Gemini is low utility (~$0.02/min); OpenAI is premium (~$0.30+/min).Moderate/Linear: Sum of components (~$0.15/min).

Infrastructure providers like Deepgram and AssemblyAI compete on transcription speed and accuracy, with Deepgram claiming 40x faster inference than standard cloud services and AssemblyAI countering with better accuracy and speed. Model providers Google and OpenAI compete on price-performance with dramatically different strategies. Google&#x27;s utility positioning makes it the default for high-volume, low-margin workflows, whereas OpenAI defends the premium tier with improved instruction following (30.5% on MultiChallenge benchmark) and enhanced function calling (66.5% on ComplexFuncBench). The gap has narrowed from 15x to 4x in pricing, but OpenAI maintains its edge in emotional expressivity and conversational fluidity - qualities that justify premium pricing for mission-critical interactions.Orchestration platforms Vapi, Retell AI, and Bland AI compete on implementation ease and feature completeness. Vapi&#x27;s developer-first approach appeals to technical teams wanting granular control, while Retell&#x27;s compliance focus (HIPAA, automatic PII redaction) makes it the default for regulated industries. Bland&#x27;s managed service model targets operations teams wanting \"set and forget\" scalability at the cost of flexibility.Unified infrastructure providers like Together AI represent the most significant architectural evolution, collapsing the modular stack into a single offering that delivers native-like latency while retaining component-level control. By co-locating STT, LLM, and TTS on the shared GPU clusters, Together AI achieves sub-500ms total latency with ~225ms for TTS generation using Mist v2.The bottom lineThe market has moved beyond choosing between \"smart\" and \"fast.\" Enterprises must now map their specific requirements — compliance posture, latency tolerance, cost constraints — to the architecture that supports them. For high-volume utility workflows involving routine, low-risk interactions, Google Gemini 2.5 Flash offers unbeatable price-to-performance at approximately 2 cents per minute. For workflows requiring sophisticated reasoning without breaking the budget, Gemini 3 Flash delivers Pro-grade intelligence at Flash-level costs.For complex, regulated workflows requiring strict governance, specific vocabulary enforcement, or integration with complex back-end systems, the modular stack delivers necessary control and auditability without the latency penalties that previously hampered modular designs. Together AI&#x27;s co-located architecture or Retell AI&#x27;s compliance-first orchestration represent the strongest contenders here. The architecture you choose today will determine whether your voice agents can operate in regulated environments — a decision far more consequential than which model sounds most human or scores highest on the latest benchmark.",

It&#x27;s a strategic choice between a cost-efficient, generalized utility model and a domain-specific, vertically integrated stack that supports compliance requirements — including whether voice agents can be deployed at scale without introducing audit gaps, regulatory risk, or downstream liability.Understanding the three architectural pathsThese architectural differences are not academic; they directly shape latency, auditability, and the ability to intervene in live voice interactions.The enterprise voice AI market has consolidated around three distinct architectures, each optimized for different trade-offs between speed, control, and cost. S2S models — including Google&#x27;s Gemini Live and OpenAI&#x27;s Realtime API — process audio inputs natively to preserve paralinguistic signals like tone and hesitation. But contrary to popular belief, these aren&#x27;t true end-to-end speech models. They operate as what the industry calls \"Half-Cascades\": Audio understanding happens natively, but the model still performs text-based reasoning before synthesizing speech output. This hybrid approach achieves latency in the 200 to 300ms range, closely mimicking human response times where pauses beyond 200ms become perceptible and feel unnatural. The trade-off is that these intermediate reasoning steps remain opaque to enterprises, limiting auditability and policy enforcement.Traditional chained pipelines represent the opposite extreme. These modular stacks follow a three-step relay: Speech-to-text engines like Deepgram&#x27;s Nova-3 or AssemblyAI&#x27;s Universal-Streaming transcribe audio into text, an LLM generates a response, and text-to-speech providers like ElevenLabs or Cartesia&#x27;s Sonic synthesize the output. Each handoff introduces network transmission time plus processing overhead. While individual components have optimized their processing times to sub-300ms, the aggregate roundtrip latency frequently exceeds 500ms, triggering \"barge-in\" collisions where users interrupt because they assume the agent hasn&#x27;t heard them. Unified infrastructure represents the architectural counter-attack from modular vendors. Together AI physically co-locates STT (Whisper Turbo), LLM (Llama/Mixtral), and TTS models (Rime, Cartesia) on the same GPU clusters. Data moves between components via high-speed memory interconnects rather than the public internet, collapsing total latency to sub-500ms while retaining the modular separation that enterprises require for compliance. Together AI benchmarks TTS latency at approximately 225ms using Mist v2, leaving sufficient headroom for transcription and reasoning within the 500ms budget that defines natural conversation. This architecture delivers the speed of a native model with the control surface of a modular stack — which can be the \"Goldilocks\" solution that addresses both performance and governance requirements simultaneously.The trade-off is increased operational complexity compared to fully managed native systems, but for regulated enterprises that complexity often maps directly to required control.Why latency determines user tolerance — and the metrics that prove itThe difference between a successful voice interaction and an abandoned call often comes down to milliseconds. A single extra second of delay can cut user satisfaction by 16%. Three technical metrics define production readiness:Time to first token (TTFT) measures the delay from the end of user speech to the start of the agent&#x27;s response. Human conversation tolerates roughly 200ms gaps; anything longer feels robotic. Native S2S models achieve 200 to 300ms, while modular stacks must optimize aggressively to stay under 500ms.Word Error Rate (WER) measures transcription accuracy. Deepgram’s Nova-3 delivers 53.4% lower WER for streaming, while AssemblyAI&#x27;s Universal-Streaming claims 41% faster word emission latency. A single transcription error — \"billing\" misheard as \"building\" — corrupts the entire downstream reasoning chain.Real-Time Factor (RTF) measures whether the system processes speech faster than users speak. An RTF below 1.0 is mandatory to prevent lag accumulation. Whisper Turbo runs 5.4x faster than Whisper Large v3, making sub-1.0 RTF achievable at scale without proprietary APIs.The modular advantage: Control and complianceFor regulated industries like healthcare and finance, \"cheap\" and \"fast\" are secondary to governance. Native S2S models function as \"black boxes,\" making it difficult to audit what the model processed before responding. Without visibility into the intermediate steps, enterprises can&#x27;t verify that sensitive data was properly handled or that the agent followed required protocols. These controls are difficult — and in some cases impossible — to implement inside opaque, end-to-end speech systems.The modular approach, on the other hand, maintains a text layer between transcription and synthesis, enabling stateful interventions impossible with end-to-end audio processing. Some use cases include:PII redaction allows compliance engines to scan intermediate text and strip out credit card numbers, patient names, or Social Security numbers before they enter the reasoning model. Retell AI&#x27;s automatic redaction of sensitive personal data from transcripts significantly lowers compliance risk — a feature that Vapi does not natively offer.Memory injection lets enterprises inject domain knowledge or user history into the prompt context before the LLM generates a response, transforming agents from transactional tools into relationship-based systems. Pronunciation authority becomes critical in regulated industries where mispronouncing a drug name or financial term creates liability. Rime&#x27;s Mist v2 focuses on deterministic pronunciation, allowing enterprises to define pronunciation dictionaries that are rigorously adhered to across millions of calls — a capability that native S2S models struggle to guarantee.Architecture comparison matrixThe table below summarizes how each architecture optimizes for a different definition of “production-ready.”FeatureNative S2S (Half-Cascade)Unified Modular (Co-located)Legacy Modular (Chained)Leading PlayersGoogle Gemini 2.5, OpenAI RealtimeTogether AI, Vapi (On-prem)Deepgram + Anthropic + ElevenLabsLatency (TTFT)~200-300ms (Human-level) ~300-500ms (Near-native) >500ms (Noticeable Lag) Cost ProfileBifurcated: Gemini is low utility (~$0.02/min); OpenAI is premium (~$0.30+/min).Moderate/Linear: Sum of components (~$0.15/min).

Infrastructure providers like Deepgram and AssemblyAI compete on transcription speed and accuracy, with Deepgram claiming 40x faster inference than standard cloud services and AssemblyAI countering with better accuracy and speed. Model providers Google and OpenAI compete on price-performance with dramatically different strategies. Google&#x27;s utility positioning makes it the default for high-volume, low-margin workflows, whereas OpenAI defends the premium tier with improved instruction following (30.5% on MultiChallenge benchmark) and enhanced function calling (66.5% on ComplexFuncBench). The gap has narrowed from 15x to 4x in pricing, but OpenAI maintains its edge in emotional expressivity and conversational fluidity - qualities that justify premium pricing for mission-critical interactions.Orchestration platforms Vapi, Retell AI, and Bland AI compete on implementation ease and feature completeness. Vapi&#x27;s developer-first approach appeals to technical teams wanting granular control, while Retell&#x27;s compliance focus (HIPAA, automatic PII redaction) makes it the default for regulated industries. Bland&#x27;s managed service model targets operations teams wanting \"set and forget\" scalability at the cost of flexibility.Unified infrastructure providers like Together AI represent the most significant architectural evolution, collapsing the modular stack into a single offering that delivers native-like latency while retaining component-level control. By co-locating STT, LLM, and TTS on the shared GPU clusters, Together AI achieves sub-500ms total latency with ~225ms for TTS generation using Mist v2.The bottom lineThe market has moved beyond choosing between \"smart\" and \"fast.\" Enterprises must now map their specific requirements — compliance posture, latency tolerance, cost constraints — to the architecture that supports them. For high-volume utility workflows involving routine, low-risk interactions, Google Gemini 2.5 Flash offers unbeatable price-to-performance at approximately 2 cents per minute. For workflows requiring sophisticated reasoning without breaking the budget, Gemini 3 Flash delivers Pro-grade intelligence at Flash-level costs.For complex, regulated workflows requiring strict governance, specific vocabulary enforcement, or integration with complex back-end systems, the modular stack delivers necessary control and auditability without the latency penalties that previously hampered modular designs. Together AI&#x27;s co-located architecture or Retell AI&#x27;s compliance-first orchestration represent the strongest contenders here. The architecture you choose today will determine whether your voice agents can operate in regulated environments — a decision far more consequential than which model sounds most human or scores highest on the latest benchmark.",

          "standfirst": "Setting up a PS5 for a child means you can offer an age-appropriate and safe platform for them to play. Sony made its parental control tools more comprehensive in recent years and they allow families to manage screen time, block unsuitable content, guide online interactions and approve purchases. The process is straightforward once the right menus are in view, but it helps to understand how each feature works before handing over the controller. The system uses individual accounts for each family member, and these accounts determine what a child can access. A parent or guardian assigns restrictions to the child’s profile and the console enforces them more consistently than earlier PlayStation systems. The process begins with creating a child account, then linking it to the Family Management section of the adult account, and finally adjusting controls on the console itself. Create a child account through Family Management A child account is required before you can use any parental controls. This account is linked to the family manager’s PlayStation account and cannot be converted into an adult account until the child reaches the appropriate age under local regulations. From the PS5 Home screen, navigate to Settings, Family and Parental Controls then choose Family Management. The system will request the family manager’s password before any changes can be made. Select Add Family Member and choose Add a Child. The console generates a QR code that opens a secure PlayStation webpage on a phone or browser. This page guides the setup process and ties the new account to the family group. The form asks for the child’s date of birth first. Sony uses this to assign default age restrictions and to determine which features are allowed. A small credit card charge may be requested to verify the adult’s identity. The next steps involve entering an email address for the child, creating a password and selecting basic settings for content access, communication and spending. The child account must then be verified through a link sent to the provided email address. This ensures the account can use PlayStation Network features including any future purchases through the PlayStation Store. Once complete, the new profile appears in the Family Management list on the PS5. This profile is now ready for fine-tuning. Manage parental controls on the console The PS5 keeps all parental controls in Family and Parental Controls within the main Settings menu. This section is organized into Playtime Settings, Content Restrictions, Communication and User-Generated Content and Spending controls. Each area can be adjusted separately for every child account in the family group. How to set limits on playtime Playtime controls help set boundaries for gaming sessions. Select the child’s profile, then open Playtime Settings. Limits can be set by total daily hours or by specific time windows. The console can be configured to notify the child when time is nearly up, or to log them out automatically once the limit is reached. These settings apply across the child’s account, so they remain active even if the child switches between PS5 consoles in the same household. Parents can choose how strictly the system enforces these rules. For example, the console can continue to display warnings without blocking gameplay or it can stop activity when the allotted time ends. Playtime reports can also be viewed through the family manager’s PlayStation account or the PS App. How to restrict content based on age ratings Sony’s content filters are based on age ratings from the ESRB in the United States and equivalent regional boards in other countries. In Family Management, select the child’s profile and then select Parental Controls. Here, parents can set an age level for games. Titles above this level will not launch without approval from the family manager. Blu-ray and DVD content can also be restricted and the system browser can be disabled entirely. If the family uses services that stream movies or TV shows through the console, those apps often apply their own content filters, but the PS5 can serve as a first line of control. Engadget How to manage communication and online interactions Online communication can be limited to prevent unwanted contact. In Parental Controls, select Communication and User-Generated Content. This area controls messaging, voice chat, profile sharing and the ability to see or share player-created media such as screenshots and video clips. Online play can also be adjusted. For younger kids, it may be helpful to block online multiplayer entirely until they better understand online etiquette and safety. For older children, communication can be limited to friends only. The PS5 respects these limits across all supported games. How to set spending limits for purchases A child account cannot use payment cards directly, but it can spend funds from the family manager’s wallet. Spending limits can be set in the child’s profile under Family Management. Parents can choose a monthly spending cap or block purchases altogether. Any attempt to exceed the limit requires approval from the family manager. This feature covers games, add-ons, subscriptions and in-game currency. It ensures surprises on the credit card are less likely, especially in titles that promote quick digital purchases. How to sign your child into the PS5 Once controls are set, the child can be added as a user on the console. Return to the home screen and select the user icon to switch users. Choose Add User, then select Get Started. Sign in using the child account’s email address and password. The console guides the profile setup process and prompts for an online ID, avatar and privacy preferences. These steps help personalise the child’s space on the PS5. The system may request a locally created passcode that prevents access to parental controls without the family manager’s approval. This passcode should be unique and not shared with the child. After setup is complete, the child will see a version of the PS5 tailored to the restrictions applied. Games that exceed the assigned age rating will appear with a lock icon and the console will block any actions that the family manager has limited. Use the PS App and PlayStation’s online tools for ongoing management Playtime and permissions can be managed remotely through Sony’s PS App or the PlayStation website. This makes it easier to adjust rules without taking over the TV. The app also provides notifications when playtime is running low or when the child attempts to access restricted content. Sony’s Family Management tools synchronise across devices. Changes made from a phone appear on the PS5 within seconds. This helps maintain consistent rules, especially in homes with more than one console. A child-ready PS5 is more than a restriction tool. It creates a safer environment for learning how to navigate digital spaces, interact with friends and handle screen time. Sony’s updated controls take much of the pressure off parents by enforcing rules in predictable ways that are difficult to bypass. Once everything is configured, the child can enjoy the console’s library while staying within the boundaries that support healthy gaming habits.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/how-to-set-up-a-ps5-for-a-child-160039866.html?src=rss",

And finally, don’t reset your old Switch right away. Keeping it powered on and accessible ensures you can confirm that all your saves and data made it across safely.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/how-to-transfer-your-games-to-the-nintendo-switch-2-130000702.html?src=rss",

We’ve thoroughly researched the market and several cards through a suite of benchmark tests. Here are the best that we’ve tested, along with some general advice on what to look for when buying a new card.

Nintendo’s gaming handheld is the only popular device that natively supports this standard right now, and microSD Express cards themselves are highly expensive compared to more traditional options. Still, if you do want to increase a Switch 2’s storage, they’re your only choice. Fortunately, determining exactly which model to buy for the console is pretty straightforward: Get whichever one you can find in stock, in the capacity you want, at a price you can stomach. We benchmarked several microSD Express cards for a separate Switch 2 guide, and for the most part, the performance differences between them weren’t great enough to justify paying extra for any particular model. Loading times weren’t quite identical with every test we ran, but the cards were extremely close in most games and common scenarios. The few times when there was a notable gap — fast-traveling to a particularly resource-heavy region in Cyberpunk 2077, for instance — the gulf between the slowest and fastest card was only ever about four or five seconds at most. That’s not nothing, but it’s also not something most people are likely to fret over unless they have a stopwatch handy. The SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro. Jeff Dunn for Engadget The only time you’d notice a major speed difference is if you transfer games to your Express card from the Switch 2’s internal storage (and vice versa). In that case, the SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro were generally the quickest, while PNY’s microSD Express Flash Memory Card had particularly slow write speeds. Moving Mario Kart World to the SanDisk and Lexar models, for example, took around four minutes and 35 seconds on average; with the PNY card, it took a little over seven minutes. That said, the PNY model was the fastest when it came to moving games back to the system storage. Walmart’s Onn microSD Express Card was significantly slower to move games from the card to system storage, but it’s also the most affordable card we’ve seen by a good distance. Either way, most people aren’t constantly shuffling their games back and forth like this. Performance in actual games is more important, and in that regard the results were consistently much tighter. What matters most is getting the most space for your budget. Unfortunately, stock for all microSD Express cards has been spotty since the Switch 2’s launch. For your convenience, we’ll list out all of the models we’ve tested thus far and their respective list prices below. Note that some lower-capacity versions — the 128GB SanDisk card, for one — advertise slower speeds than their more spacious counterparts. SanDisk microSD Express Card: 128GB ($64), 256GB ($78), 512GB ($128) Lexar Play Pro: 256GB ($60), 512GB ($120), 1TB ($220) PNY microSD Express Flash Memory Card: 128GB ($48), 256GB ($62), 512GB ($124) Samsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2: 256GB ($60) Samsung P9 Express: 256GB ($55), 512GB ($100) GameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2: 256GB ($60), 512GB ($100), 1TB ($190) Walmart Onn microSDXC Express Card: 256GB ($47), 512GB ($85) The Lexar Play Pro on top of Lexar's RW540 microSD Express card reader. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Broadly speaking, we recommend getting at least 256GB of storage, as Switch 2 games tend to have much larger file sizes than games for Nintendo’s previous handheld. But we also recommend holding off upgrading for as long as you can, if only because all of these cards should (tariff shenanigans aside) come down in price as time goes on. There’s no point in buying a microSD Express card for anything besides the Switch 2, but we did run the models above through our usual PC benchmarks as well. Unsurprisingly, they are miles faster than any traditional card on the market. With the 256GB SanDisk card, for instance, sequential read speeds checked in just under 900 MB/s in CrystalDiskMark and ATTO, while sequential writes topped out around 650 MB/s. Sustained writes speeds were slower (around 210 MB/s), but that was still fast enough to move our 12GB test file to the card in 52 seconds on average. It took a mere 20 seconds to read the file back to our PC. The write test with our smaller 1.15GB test folder, meanwhile, averaged just 4.5 seconds. It all adds up to performance that's at least twice as fast as the best UHS-I models we’ve tested in terms of sequential reads and writes, with three or four times the speeds in some cases. The gulf in random reads and writes is similar, and in some benchmarks even greater. But you need a pricey SD card reader to even see those increases on a PC, so only those with a Switch 2 in hand or serious cash to burn should consider one of these things. Other notable microSD cards Samsung Pro Ultimate The Samsung Pro Ultimate was the closest competitor to the Lexar Professional Silver Plus across our benchmark tests, but it's tangibly worse in terms of sequential write speeds, typically costs more and doesn’t offer a 1TB option. The Samsung Pro Plus is a bit slower for sequential reads, but it’s close enough otherwise and usually easier to find at a lower price. Lexar Professional Gold We haven't used it ourselves, but if you’re willing to pay for a more powerful UHS-II card built for heavy-duty video recording, the Lexar Professional Gold has tested well elsewhere and should deliver significantly faster sequential write speeds than our UHS-I picks above. It’s one of the few UHS-II cards we could actually find in stock, but it’s pricey, with a 128GB model normally priced in the $35 to $40 range. SanDisk Extreme The SanDisk Extreme effectively matched the Pro Plus in a few of our sequential tests, but that was partly due to us only being able to secure the 256GB model, which is higher-rated than the 128GB version. It’s a fine choice if you see it on sale at a reputable seller, but it’s broadly slower than our top pick and often costs more. SanDisk GamePlay The SanDisk GamePlay performs similarly to the SanDisk Extreme but costs a good bit extra as of our latest update. We couldn’t get it to reach its advertised speeds with the company’s own “Pro” card reader or other third-party options, so it fell short of our top picks. SanDisk Pokémon The SanDisk Pokémon does outperform its advertised read and write speeds, but not by enough to outpace the Lexar Silver Plus or Samsung Pro Plus. It essentially charges extra for having a picture of Pikachu (or Gengar, or Snorlax) on a product you’ll never look at. SanDisk Extreme Pro The SanDisk Extreme Pro is a close analog to the Samsung Pro Ultimate but, as of this writing, is either unavailable at most trusted retailers or priced too high by comparison. The Lexar Professional Silver Plus has faster sequential write speeds as well. PNY XLR8 Gaming The PNY XLR8 is an affordable card that comes with up to 512GB of space. Its sequential and random writes speeds checked in a little bit above those of Samsung’s Evo Select, plus it comes with a lifetime warranty. But its sequential reads were much, much slower, putting it out of contention. PNY Elite-X The PNY Elite-X often goes for cheap and wasn’t too far off the random read/write performance of Samsung's Pro Plus in CrystalDiskMark. Like the XLR8, it’s also slightly above the Evo Select in write speeds. But its sequential reads were too far behind all of our top picks, and it no longer appears to be available in capacities above 256GB. What to look for in a microSD card Capacity The first thing to figure out when buying a microSD card is how much storage space you need. Modern cards are commonly available in sizes ranging from 32GB to 512GB, with several models now available in 1TB or 1.5TB capacities as well. The first 2TB cards from major brands have started to arrive as well, which is exciting, but those are still fairly rare (and very expensive) by comparison. For many, a 128GB or 256GB model should be a sweet spot between price and storage space. But if you need more room — say, for stashing a bunch of games on a Steam Deck — a 512GB card or greater could make more sense and often provides a better cost-per-GB ratio. Pricing and stock levels are all over the place as of our most recent update thanks to ongoing AI-driven shortages, but you can typically still find a decent 128GB card for around $15, a good 256GB card for less than $30 and a solid 512GB card for around $40 (with faster models priced a little higher). There’s a starker increase when you go up to 1TB cards, which often cost closer to $100, though we’ve seen some fall into the $70 to $80 range over the last year. The first 2TB cards are a bigger leap: the 2TB SanDisk Extreme, for example, currently has a list price around $290, which is way up from what we saw in 2025. Note that a microSD card’s performance may differ depending on what capacity you buy. SanDisk says its 128GB Extreme card delivers sequential write speeds up to 90 MB/s, for example, while the higher-capacity models in the same line offer up to 130 MB/s. When we talk about microSD cards today, we mostly refer to cards that use the microSDXC (eXtended Capacity) standard, which have a capacity between 32GB and 2TB. Your device needs to support this for it to work with a microSDXC card. This will almost never be an issue these days, but some older devices (a Nintendo 3DS, for instance) are only compatible with microSDHC (High Capacity) cards, which range from 2GB to 32GB. Read and write speeds MicroSD cards are primarily judged on their read and write speeds, which are usually measured in megabytes per second (MB/s). Generally, most microSD cards have faster read speeds than write speeds. These metrics can then be broken down into sequential and random performance. Sequential read and write speeds matter when you’re trying to access (read) or save (write) long, constant streams of data, such as opening a large video or copying a big batch of files from a PC. If you want to use a microSD card for media storage, this is particularly important. Random performance, meanwhile, is about how quickly a card can read and write small files scattered throughout the device. Since random read/write speeds are much lower than sequential ones, storage device makers tend not to advertise them as loudly. But they’re important if you use a card with a gaming device or a single-board computer like the Raspberry Pi, where it often has to rapidly save and access small bits of data in random locations. Speed ratings If you look at a microSD card, you’ll see a buffet of numbers, letters and symbols. Most of these refer to the card’s speed class and performance ratings, which are determined by the SD Association. A card’s Video Speed Class, or V-rating, details its minimum sequential write speed, which is especially important when recording video from a camera. It ranges from V6 to V90. Most of the cards we tested had a V30 rating, so they have a sequential write speed of at least 30 MB/s. This should be enough to support up to 4K video at lower bitrates. Higher-rated V60 and V90 cards are usually better for capturing 8K, but they come at a much higher cost. The UHS Speed Class, or U-rating, also refers to a card’s minimum sequential write speed. It comes in two varieties: U3, which mandates a minimum of 30 MB/s, and U1, which is rated for 10 MB/s. The older Speed Class rating overlaps with the other two systems. It’s signified by a C symbol and goes from Class 2 to Class 10, with the number (again) indicating minimum sequential write speed. This rating is less relevant nowadays, but you may still see a “C10” logo on some cards. The Application Performance spec, marked by an A symbol, is an indicator of random read/write speeds. This is measured in IOPS, or input/output operations per second, rather than MB/s. There are two categories here: A1 cards offer a minimum random read speed of 1,500 IOPS and a minimum random write speed of 500 IOPS, while A2 cards bump those up to 4,000 IOPS and 2,000 IOPS, respectively. Both ratings also guarantee sequential write speeds of at least 10 MB/s. To keep it simple, most people should look for a card with V30, U3 and A2 ratings. It’s totally possible to get a solid card without those: A U1 card might be worth it if you just need a cheap, high-capacity option, for example. V60 and V90 cards are worth a look if you’re serious about shooting high-resolution photos and video as well. But overall, cards with the certifications above should provide the best blend of price and performance today. It’s important to emphasize that these ratings are baselines. Most V30 cards offer significantly higher write speeds than 30 MB/s, for instance, and some A1 cards can outperform some A2 models in practice. The speeds advertised by manufacturers aren’t always 100 percent accurate, either: Sometimes the card will be slower in real-world use, other times it may actually be a bit faster. Samsung UHS bus speeds The other spec to note is the card’s bus interface. Most microSD cards available today are UHS-I, which has a theoretical maximum speed of 104 MB/s. There are also UHS-II cards, which have an extra row of pins on the back and can reach up to 312 MB/s. (A UHS-III standard technically exists as well but hasn’t seen wide adoption.) These are labeled on the card with a Roman numeral I or II. UHS-II cards are typically the ones with those higher V60 or V90 ratings. If you shoot lots of 4K to 8K video or frequently use burst mode to capture ultra high-res photos, the performance gains of a good UHS-II card can save you time. However, these are typically much more expensive than UHS-I cards: This 128GB Lexar Professional Gold model, for instance, is a relative bargain at $35. While that's less than many UHS-II models we’ve seen in the past, it's still more than double the common street price of our top pick above. You need a device that’s compatible with the UHS-II interface to see any benefits, too, and stock for UHS-II cards is often spottier. For now, the higher speeds aren’t worth the price premium for most people, so we stuck mostly to UHS-I cards with our recommendations. Unlike traditional UHS-I cards, a microSD Express card like the SanDisk model on the right comes with a second row of pins to enable its improved performance. Jeff Dunn for Engadget microSD Express and the Nintendo Switch 2 The absolute fastest microSD cards you can buy, however, are based on a different interface called SD Express. This has technically been around for several years and now includes its own subset of speed classes, but the gist is that it's much faster than UHS-I or UHS-II: SanDisk’s recently released microSD Express card, one of the first commercially available models, advertises sequential read speeds up to 880MB/s. That’s quicker than some older SSDs. It’s a substantial upgrade that has largely held up in our testing, but very few popular devices natively support SD Express today. The first major exception is the Nintendo Switch 2, which is only compatible with the newer standard, as it’s needed to keep up with the performance demands of new handheld games. Besides SanDisk, manufacturers like Samsung, Lexar and PNY have already launched microSD Express cards to go with the console. The presumption is that having such a popular device embrace the tech will only further its adoption and drive prices down. But it’s still early days, and right now all microSD Express cards cost much more than the best UHS-I or even UHS-II options. Beyond the Switch 2, it’s possible to take advantage of these cards’ superior speeds with a dedicated SD Express card reader, but that adds even more to the final cost. It’s also worth noting that SD Express cards are not backwards compatible with UHS-II (or UHS-III), so if you try to plug one into a device with a UHS-II slot, it’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds. Still, they’re a must for Nintendo fans going forward, and the tech should have plenty of appeal if more gadgets that support the interface do arrive. For more on how the first wave of Express cards perform on the Switch 2, we've put together a dedicated buying guide just for Nintendo's console. A note on card readers and reaching advertised speeds While the UHS-I interface has a theoretical maximum of 104 MB/s, some UHS-I cards can exceed that speed through proprietary extensions. However, you need a compatible card reader and host device to take advantage of that extra performance. If you find a UHS-I card advertising speeds higher than 104 MB/s, this is what’s going on. You can see these limits in action with an original Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck: Both of those gaming devices support the UHS-I interface but don’t go beyond its official speed, flattening any sequential gains some cards may have elsewhere. (Differences in random read and write speeds can still matter, though.) The same thing will happen if you plug a more powerful UHS-II or SD Express card into a device that doesn’t accept those interfaces. The takeaway: Your microSD card will only be as fast as the slowest link in your chain. Warranty Many microSD cards are designed to be durable, with protection from water, extreme temperatures, X-rays and drops. Still, in case of catastrophe, a long warranty is always good to have. Many manufacturers offer lifetime or 10-year limited warranties, though we’ve noticed that “endurance” cards marketed to withstand more hours of writing are usually covered for a shorter period of time. For example, Samsung's Pro Endurance, a model aimed at security cameras and other monitoring devices, comes with a five-year warranty. Avoiding counterfeits The memory card market has had a particular problem with scammers selling fake products. To guard against this, only buy from a known brand and a reputable retailer such as Best Buy, B&H Photo or Adorama. If you shop at Amazon, only buy if the shipper and seller is Amazon.com. (That said, a handful of users have reported receiving counterfeits even from Amazon directly in the past, so exercise caution.) Remember: If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of any retailer offering a significantly lower price than everyone else. Once you receive a card, check its packaging for any irregularities. You can run benchmark tests like CrystalDiskMark or BlackMagic Disk Speed Test to verify its speeds aren’t drastically lower than what’s advertised (or possible, given its specs). You can also use software that’s designed to verify the true capacity and performance of your card, such as H2testw and FakeFlashTest. A few of the microSD card readers we've used for testing. Jeff Dunn for Engadget How we test microSD cards We've put about 20 microSD cards through a series of tests to verify their sequential and random performance. These included benchmarks like CrystalDiskMark, BlackMagic Disk Speed Test, ATTO Disk Benchmark and AJA System Test, as well as a few “real-world” tests. We copied and pasted a small folder of photos about 1.15GB in size to and from each card, then did the same with a larger 12.2GB folder containing multiple file types and subfolders, timing the process each time. We also checked how each card performed on the Steam Deck, downloading games of varying sizes — including Stardew Valley, Aperture Desk Job, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Apex Legends — then timing how long it took to launch each game and load save files. We do multiple runs of each test to verify our findings and account for potential outliers. Where applicable, we used a Kingston USB 3.2 UHS-II reader to test each card on both Windows 11 and macOS Sequoia. However, if a card could be bundled with (or is specifically advertised to use) a proprietary reader, we mainly tested with that, since we figure that’s the one most interested buyers will end up using. For Windows testing, we used an Alienware gaming PC with an Intel Core i9-10900F, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. For macOS, we used a 2021 16-inch MacBook Pro with an Apple M1 Pro chip, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. If a reader couldn’t connect over USB-C, we used CalDigit’s TS4 dock to test the corresponding card on the MacBook. We tested the 128GB version of each card whenever we could, though we were only able to test higher-capacity models for a few options. We also reformatted each card before testing with the SD Association’s Memory Card Formatter tool. For microSD Express cards, we ran each model through a series of tests specific to the Switch 2, since that is the only popular device that actually supports the tech. You can read more about that process in our separate buying guide linked above. Recent updates December 2025: We’ve tested the Samsung P9 Express microSD Express card and noted it in our Switch 2 section above. We’ve also made a few edits to highlight recent price increases and stock shortages driven by the ongoing AI boom. November 2025: We’ve tested Walmart’s Onn microSD Express Card and edited our notes on the best cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 accordingly. September 2025: We’ve fleshed out our advice on buying a microSD Express card for the Nintendo Switch 2. May 2025: We’ve updated this guide to ensure our advice is accurate and to reflect the new Nintendo Switch 2’s use of microSD Express cards. We’ve also added testing notes for the Lexar Play Pro microSD Express card and the more standard PNY XLR8. We’ve removed mentions of a few cards that have seemingly been discontinued, including the original Kingston Canvas Go Plus, the Lexar Professional 1066x and the 2021 Samsung Evo Select. We plan to test more new microSD Express cards for a future update. February 2025: We’ve updated this guide with a new top pick: the Lexar Professional Silver Plus. The Samsung Pro Plus, our previous recommendation, stays as a runner-up. We’ve also added SanDisk’s recently released microSD Express card as a pick for those who want the absolute fastest card possible, albeit with heavy caveats. This is one of the first microSD cards to use the SD Express bus interface, so we’ve included more details on what that entails in our “what to look for in a microSD card” section. Lastly, we’ve removed our write-up for SanDisk’s Apex Legends card, as it appears to have been discontinued, and included testing notes for a couple of the company’s more recent releases. November 2024: We've checked back with this guide to ensure our recommendations are still accurate and made light edits for clarity. August 2024: We’ve updated this guide to note the recently released 1TB models for three of our top picks: the Samsung Pro Plus, the Kingston Canvas Go Plus and the Samsung Evo Select. We’ve also made sure all pricing details are as up to date as they can be.

SanDisk Extreme Pro The SanDisk Extreme Pro is a close analog to the Samsung Pro Ultimate but, as of this writing, is either unavailable at most trusted retailers or priced too high by comparison. The Lexar Professional Silver Plus has faster sequential write speeds as well. PNY XLR8 Gaming The PNY XLR8 is an affordable card that comes with up to 512GB of space. Its sequential and random writes speeds checked in a little bit above those of Samsung’s Evo Select, plus it comes with a lifetime warranty. But its sequential reads were much, much slower, putting it out of contention. PNY Elite-X The PNY Elite-X often goes for cheap and wasn’t too far off the random read/write performance of Samsung's Pro Plus in CrystalDiskMark. Like the XLR8, it’s also slightly above the Evo Select in write speeds. But its sequential reads were too far behind all of our top picks, and it no longer appears to be available in capacities above 256GB. What to look for in a microSD card Capacity The first thing to figure out when buying a microSD card is how much storage space you need. Modern cards are commonly available in sizes ranging from 32GB to 512GB, with several models now available in 1TB or 1.5TB capacities as well. The first 2TB cards from major brands have started to arrive as well, which is exciting, but those are still fairly rare (and very expensive) by comparison. For many, a 128GB or 256GB model should be a sweet spot between price and storage space. But if you need more room — say, for stashing a bunch of games on a Steam Deck — a 512GB card or greater could make more sense and often provides a better cost-per-GB ratio. Pricing and stock levels are all over the place as of our most recent update thanks to ongoing AI-driven shortages, but you can typically still find a decent 128GB card for around $15, a good 256GB card for less than $30 and a solid 512GB card for around $40 (with faster models priced a little higher). There’s a starker increase when you go up to 1TB cards, which often cost closer to $100, though we’ve seen some fall into the $70 to $80 range over the last year. The first 2TB cards are a bigger leap: the 2TB SanDisk Extreme, for example, currently has a list price around $290, which is way up from what we saw in 2025. Note that a microSD card’s performance may differ depending on what capacity you buy. SanDisk says its 128GB Extreme card delivers sequential write speeds up to 90 MB/s, for example, while the higher-capacity models in the same line offer up to 130 MB/s. When we talk about microSD cards today, we mostly refer to cards that use the microSDXC (eXtended Capacity) standard, which have a capacity between 32GB and 2TB. Your device needs to support this for it to work with a microSDXC card. This will almost never be an issue these days, but some older devices (a Nintendo 3DS, for instance) are only compatible with microSDHC (High Capacity) cards, which range from 2GB to 32GB. Read and write speeds MicroSD cards are primarily judged on their read and write speeds, which are usually measured in megabytes per second (MB/s). Generally, most microSD cards have faster read speeds than write speeds. These metrics can then be broken down into sequential and random performance. Sequential read and write speeds matter when you’re trying to access (read) or save (write) long, constant streams of data, such as opening a large video or copying a big batch of files from a PC. If you want to use a microSD card for media storage, this is particularly important. Random performance, meanwhile, is about how quickly a card can read and write small files scattered throughout the device. Since random read/write speeds are much lower than sequential ones, storage device makers tend not to advertise them as loudly. But they’re important if you use a card with a gaming device or a single-board computer like the Raspberry Pi, where it often has to rapidly save and access small bits of data in random locations. Speed ratings If you look at a microSD card, you’ll see a buffet of numbers, letters and symbols. Most of these refer to the card’s speed class and performance ratings, which are determined by the SD Association. A card’s Video Speed Class, or V-rating, details its minimum sequential write speed, which is especially important when recording video from a camera. It ranges from V6 to V90. Most of the cards we tested had a V30 rating, so they have a sequential write speed of at least 30 MB/s. This should be enough to support up to 4K video at lower bitrates. Higher-rated V60 and V90 cards are usually better for capturing 8K, but they come at a much higher cost. The UHS Speed Class, or U-rating, also refers to a card’s minimum sequential write speed. It comes in two varieties: U3, which mandates a minimum of 30 MB/s, and U1, which is rated for 10 MB/s. The older Speed Class rating overlaps with the other two systems. It’s signified by a C symbol and goes from Class 2 to Class 10, with the number (again) indicating minimum sequential write speed. This rating is less relevant nowadays, but you may still see a “C10” logo on some cards. The Application Performance spec, marked by an A symbol, is an indicator of random read/write speeds. This is measured in IOPS, or input/output operations per second, rather than MB/s. There are two categories here: A1 cards offer a minimum random read speed of 1,500 IOPS and a minimum random write speed of 500 IOPS, while A2 cards bump those up to 4,000 IOPS and 2,000 IOPS, respectively. Both ratings also guarantee sequential write speeds of at least 10 MB/s. To keep it simple, most people should look for a card with V30, U3 and A2 ratings. It’s totally possible to get a solid card without those: A U1 card might be worth it if you just need a cheap, high-capacity option, for example. V60 and V90 cards are worth a look if you’re serious about shooting high-resolution photos and video as well. But overall, cards with the certifications above should provide the best blend of price and performance today. It’s important to emphasize that these ratings are baselines. Most V30 cards offer significantly higher write speeds than 30 MB/s, for instance, and some A1 cards can outperform some A2 models in practice. The speeds advertised by manufacturers aren’t always 100 percent accurate, either: Sometimes the card will be slower in real-world use, other times it may actually be a bit faster. Samsung UHS bus speeds The other spec to note is the card’s bus interface. Most microSD cards available today are UHS-I, which has a theoretical maximum speed of 104 MB/s. There are also UHS-II cards, which have an extra row of pins on the back and can reach up to 312 MB/s. (A UHS-III standard technically exists as well but hasn’t seen wide adoption.) These are labeled on the card with a Roman numeral I or II. UHS-II cards are typically the ones with those higher V60 or V90 ratings. If you shoot lots of 4K to 8K video or frequently use burst mode to capture ultra high-res photos, the performance gains of a good UHS-II card can save you time. However, these are typically much more expensive than UHS-I cards: This 128GB Lexar Professional Gold model, for instance, is a relative bargain at $35. While that's less than many UHS-II models we’ve seen in the past, it's still more than double the common street price of our top pick above. You need a device that’s compatible with the UHS-II interface to see any benefits, too, and stock for UHS-II cards is often spottier. For now, the higher speeds aren’t worth the price premium for most people, so we stuck mostly to UHS-I cards with our recommendations. Unlike traditional UHS-I cards, a microSD Express card like the SanDisk model on the right comes with a second row of pins to enable its improved performance. Jeff Dunn for Engadget microSD Express and the Nintendo Switch 2 The absolute fastest microSD cards you can buy, however, are based on a different interface called SD Express. This has technically been around for several years and now includes its own subset of speed classes, but the gist is that it's much faster than UHS-I or UHS-II: SanDisk’s recently released microSD Express card, one of the first commercially available models, advertises sequential read speeds up to 880MB/s. That’s quicker than some older SSDs. It’s a substantial upgrade that has largely held up in our testing, but very few popular devices natively support SD Express today. The first major exception is the Nintendo Switch 2, which is only compatible with the newer standard, as it’s needed to keep up with the performance demands of new handheld games. Besides SanDisk, manufacturers like Samsung, Lexar and PNY have already launched microSD Express cards to go with the console. The presumption is that having such a popular device embrace the tech will only further its adoption and drive prices down. But it’s still early days, and right now all microSD Express cards cost much more than the best UHS-I or even UHS-II options. Beyond the Switch 2, it’s possible to take advantage of these cards’ superior speeds with a dedicated SD Express card reader, but that adds even more to the final cost. It’s also worth noting that SD Express cards are not backwards compatible with UHS-II (or UHS-III), so if you try to plug one into a device with a UHS-II slot, it’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds. Still, they’re a must for Nintendo fans going forward, and the tech should have plenty of appeal if more gadgets that support the interface do arrive. For more on how the first wave of Express cards perform on the Switch 2, we've put together a dedicated buying guide just for Nintendo's console. A note on card readers and reaching advertised speeds While the UHS-I interface has a theoretical maximum of 104 MB/s, some UHS-I cards can exceed that speed through proprietary extensions. However, you need a compatible card reader and host device to take advantage of that extra performance. If you find a UHS-I card advertising speeds higher than 104 MB/s, this is what’s going on. You can see these limits in action with an original Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck: Both of those gaming devices support the UHS-I interface but don’t go beyond its official speed, flattening any sequential gains some cards may have elsewhere. (Differences in random read and write speeds can still matter, though.) The same thing will happen if you plug a more powerful UHS-II or SD Express card into a device that doesn’t accept those interfaces. The takeaway: Your microSD card will only be as fast as the slowest link in your chain. Warranty Many microSD cards are designed to be durable, with protection from water, extreme temperatures, X-rays and drops. Still, in case of catastrophe, a long warranty is always good to have. Many manufacturers offer lifetime or 10-year limited warranties, though we’ve noticed that “endurance” cards marketed to withstand more hours of writing are usually covered for a shorter period of time. For example, Samsung's Pro Endurance, a model aimed at security cameras and other monitoring devices, comes with a five-year warranty. Avoiding counterfeits The memory card market has had a particular problem with scammers selling fake products. To guard against this, only buy from a known brand and a reputable retailer such as Best Buy, B&H Photo or Adorama. If you shop at Amazon, only buy if the shipper and seller is Amazon.com. (That said, a handful of users have reported receiving counterfeits even from Amazon directly in the past, so exercise caution.) Remember: If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of any retailer offering a significantly lower price than everyone else. Once you receive a card, check its packaging for any irregularities. You can run benchmark tests like CrystalDiskMark or BlackMagic Disk Speed Test to verify its speeds aren’t drastically lower than what’s advertised (or possible, given its specs). You can also use software that’s designed to verify the true capacity and performance of your card, such as H2testw and FakeFlashTest. A few of the microSD card readers we've used for testing. Jeff Dunn for Engadget How we test microSD cards We've put about 20 microSD cards through a series of tests to verify their sequential and random performance. These included benchmarks like CrystalDiskMark, BlackMagic Disk Speed Test, ATTO Disk Benchmark and AJA System Test, as well as a few “real-world” tests. We copied and pasted a small folder of photos about 1.15GB in size to and from each card, then did the same with a larger 12.2GB folder containing multiple file types and subfolders, timing the process each time. We also checked how each card performed on the Steam Deck, downloading games of varying sizes — including Stardew Valley, Aperture Desk Job, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Apex Legends — then timing how long it took to launch each game and load save files. We do multiple runs of each test to verify our findings and account for potential outliers. Where applicable, we used a Kingston USB 3.2 UHS-II reader to test each card on both Windows 11 and macOS Sequoia. However, if a card could be bundled with (or is specifically advertised to use) a proprietary reader, we mainly tested with that, since we figure that’s the one most interested buyers will end up using. For Windows testing, we used an Alienware gaming PC with an Intel Core i9-10900F, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. For macOS, we used a 2021 16-inch MacBook Pro with an Apple M1 Pro chip, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. If a reader couldn’t connect over USB-C, we used CalDigit’s TS4 dock to test the corresponding card on the MacBook. We tested the 128GB version of each card whenever we could, though we were only able to test higher-capacity models for a few options. We also reformatted each card before testing with the SD Association’s Memory Card Formatter tool. For microSD Express cards, we ran each model through a series of tests specific to the Switch 2, since that is the only popular device that actually supports the tech. You can read more about that process in our separate buying guide linked above. Recent updates December 2025: We’ve tested the Samsung P9 Express microSD Express card and noted it in our Switch 2 section above. We’ve also made a few edits to highlight recent price increases and stock shortages driven by the ongoing AI boom. November 2025: We’ve tested Walmart’s Onn microSD Express Card and edited our notes on the best cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 accordingly. September 2025: We’ve fleshed out our advice on buying a microSD Express card for the Nintendo Switch 2. May 2025: We’ve updated this guide to ensure our advice is accurate and to reflect the new Nintendo Switch 2’s use of microSD Express cards. We’ve also added testing notes for the Lexar Play Pro microSD Express card and the more standard PNY XLR8. We’ve removed mentions of a few cards that have seemingly been discontinued, including the original Kingston Canvas Go Plus, the Lexar Professional 1066x and the 2021 Samsung Evo Select. We plan to test more new microSD Express cards for a future update. February 2025: We’ve updated this guide with a new top pick: the Lexar Professional Silver Plus. The Samsung Pro Plus, our previous recommendation, stays as a runner-up. We’ve also added SanDisk’s recently released microSD Express card as a pick for those who want the absolute fastest card possible, albeit with heavy caveats. This is one of the first microSD cards to use the SD Express bus interface, so we’ve included more details on what that entails in our “what to look for in a microSD card” section. Lastly, we’ve removed our write-up for SanDisk’s Apex Legends card, as it appears to have been discontinued, and included testing notes for a couple of the company’s more recent releases. November 2024: We've checked back with this guide to ensure our recommendations are still accurate and made light edits for clarity. August 2024: We’ve updated this guide to note the recently released 1TB models for three of our top picks: the Samsung Pro Plus, the Kingston Canvas Go Plus and the Samsung Evo Select. We’ve also made sure all pricing details are as up to date as they can be.

She has an extensive background writing about the intersection of math, art, and science. So she was a natural choice to speak at the annual conference of Harvard's interdisciplinary Black Hole Initiative a few years ago. Gamwell focused her talk on the art of black holes, and thus the seeds for what would become Conjuring the Void were sown. \"I was just astounded at how much art there is [about black holes], and I was specifically interested in Asian art,\" Gamwell told Ars. \"There's just something about the concept of a black hole that resonates with the Eastern tradition. So many of the themes—the science of black holes, void, nothingness, being inescapable—relate to the philosophy of Buddhism and Taoism and so on.\"Read full article Comments",

          "content": "When we put together our top 20 games of last year, we specifically called out Civilization 7, Avowed, Doom: The Dark Ages, and Grand Theft Auto 6 as big franchise games we were already looking forward to for 2025. While one of those games has been delayed into 2026, the three others made this year's list of Ars' favorite games as expected. They join a handful of other highly anticipated sequels, ranging from big-budget blockbusters to long-gestating indies, on the \"expected\" side of this year's list. But the games that really stood out for me in 2025 were the ones that seemed to come out of nowhere. Those range from hard-to-categorize roguelike puzzle games to a gonzo, punishing mountainous walking simulation, the best Geometry Wars clone in years, and a touching look at the difficulties of adolescence through the surprisingly effective lens of mini-games. As we look toward 2026, there are plenty of other big-budget projects that the industry is busy preparing for (the delayed Grand Theft Auto VI chief among them). If next year is anything like this year, though, we can look forward to plenty more games that no one saw coming suddenly vaulting into view as new classics.Read full article Comments",
