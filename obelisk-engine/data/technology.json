Now, when you come across an end screen, you can select a new “hide” button in the top-right corner of the video so you can finish what you’re watching without distractions. YouTube says it’s making the change in response to feedback that viewers want to be able to “focus on the content they&#8217;re watching.” I’ve long looked for ways to hide these screens, as they sometimes cover the tail end of the video I’m trying to watch and make it difficult to see what’s happening. YouTube notes that when you select the “hide” button, it only applies to the video you’re watching — not all of them on the platform. You can also bring back the end screen by selecting the “show” button. YouTube found that this didn’t have a substantial impact on a creator’s view count while testing the feature, as it says the “hide” button resulted in just a 1.5 percent decrease in views stemming from end screen clickthroughs. In addition to this change, YouTube is removing the “subscribe” button that appears when you hover your mouse over a channel’s watermark on desktop. Doing this will “simplify and improve the viewing experience,” according to YouTube, as the platform already displays a subscribe button directly beneath videos. Neither of these updates will affect how creators make videos, as they can continue to add end screens and watermarks.",

          "content": "Travellers wait in terminal 4 at Heathrow Airport. The UK’s National Crime Agency arrested a man in West Sussex in connection with a ransomware attack that caused significant flight delays last week and forced many airlines to check passengers and luggage manually. The cyberattack impacted several airports across Europe, including London’s Heathrow and Berlin’s Brandenburg. The agency shared little about the arrest in its announcement today other than that the target was “a man in his forties” and that he was released on conditional bail as the investigation progresses. The attack targeted the Multi-User System Environment (MUSE) used by airports, a piece of software developed by Collins Aerospace which allows multiple airlines to share a single check-in desk. While some larger airlines like British Airways were able to switch to a backup system and minimize the impact, many smaller providers resorted to manually checking-in passengers, something that has largely fallen out of favor in the era of smartphones and self-serve kiosks. Information is very limited, though it does not appear that this was a particularly sophisticated attack carried out by some powerful cabal. Cyber security expert Kevin Beaumont claimed on Mastodon that a very simple ransomware tool called Hardbit was the weapon of choice. Though, BleepingComputer says its sources are suggesting a different variant called Loki was used. But, as BleepingComputer points out, both of these are Ransomware-as-a-Service tools, and generally used in smaller scale attacks, not the sort of thing that brings air traffic to a crawl across an entire continent.",

This expansion of genetic surveillance was never authorized by Congress for citizens, children, or civil detainees. According to newly released government data analyzed by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy & Technology, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, collected the DNA of nearly 2,000 US citizens between 2020 and 2024 and had it sent to CODIS, the FBI’s nationwide system for policing investigations. An estimated 95 were minors, some as young as 14. The entries also include travelers never charged with a crime and dozens of cases where agents left the “charges” field blank. In other files, officers invoked civil penalties as justification for swabs that federal law reserves for criminal arrests. The findings appear to point to a program running outside the bounds of statute or oversight, experts say, with CBP officers exercising broad discretion to capture genetic material from Americans and have it funneled into a law-enforcement database designed in part for convicted offenders. Critics warn that anyone added to the database could endure heightened scrutiny by US law enforcement for life.Read full article Comments",

However, we're willing to bet your backlog can't hold a candle to that of SonixLegend, who recently earned a unique Steam badge as the first person to own 40,000 distinct paid games on Valve's platform. Based in Shanghai, SonixLegend obtained their 40,000th Steam game this week, according to Steam's badge data, putting them atop an elite club of just 19 Steam users with at least 30,000 paid games. According to SteamDB tracking, that makes for an account roughly worth anywhere from $248,000 (based on the lowest prices ever tracked in the database) to $642,000 (based on the current prices of those games). However, SonixLegend's full collection might be more extensive than this massive achievement suggests. That's because Steam's Game Collector badges don't track any of the many, many shovelware titles that have failed to reach \"broad player engagement and some commercial success\" on the service under Valve's \"profile features\" guidelines. It also reportedly doesn't include almost all free-to-play games, which could easily be used to inflate a title count for determined badge chasers.Read full article Comments",

Trump was there with his health secretary, anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to link autism to the use of Tylenol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy. While medical experts condemn the claim as unproven and dangerous (which it is), Kennedy's anti-vaccine followers decried it as a distraction from their favored false and dangerous explanation—that vaccines cause autism (which they don't). Pinning the blame on Tylenol instead of vaccines enraged Kennedy's own anti-vaccine organization, Children's Health Defense. In the run-up to the event Monday evening, CHD retweeted an all-caps defense of Tylenol, and CHD President Mary Holland called the announcement a \"sideshow\" in an interview with Steve Bannon.Read full article Comments",

The massive buildout aims to handle ChatGPT's 700 million weekly users and train future AI models, although critics question whether the investment structure can sustain itself. The companies said the expansion puts them on track to secure the full $500 billion, 10-gigawatt commitment they announced in January by the end of 2025. The five new sites will include three locations developed through an OpenAI and Oracle partnership: Shackelford County, Texas; Doña Ana County, New Mexico; and an unspecified Midwest location. These sites, along with a 600-megawatt expansion near the flagship Stargate site in Abilene, Texas, can deliver over 5.5 gigawatts of capacity, which means the computers on site will be able to draw up to 5.5 billion watts of electricity when running at full load. The companies expect the sites to create over 25,000 onsite jobs.Read full article Comments",

The move comes amid Donald Trump's heightening global trade war and after years of Taiwan's use of its chip dominance as a shield against Chinese aggression, with Taiwan allying with the US to stave off China's threats of invasion. Under the so-called \"one-China principle,\" China has rejected Taiwan's independence, requiring allies to sever ties with Taiwan. On Tuesday, Taiwan announced that it would be limiting shipments of semiconductors into South Africa—among 47 restricted products—due to national security concerns. The rare export curbs could hit South Africa's \"electronics, telecom, and auto parts sectors\" hard, MSN reported, if South Africa doesn't meet with Taiwan to discuss better terms within the next 60 days.Read full article Comments",

Ars first covered the technology, known as vehicle-to-grid or V2G, back in 2009 when Ford and American Electric Power in Ohio started playing with the idea, although that pilot involved hybrids rather than battery EVs. A couple of years later, General Motors tried something similar with the plug-in hybrid Volt, and since then, battery EVs with much larger lithium-ion packs have gotten in on the act, although such pilot programs have invariably involved commercial EV fleets. More recently, we've started seeing EVs that have been designed from the ground up to be capable of bidirectional charging. And since July, some owners of Ford F-150 Lightnings have been sending stored energy back into the grid between 5 pm and 9 pm on weekdays, earning them some cash in the process. Sunrun, which provides home energy storage and solar solutions, started working with Baltimore Gas and Electric Company on the project last year. This summer, it expanded its work to include the nation's first residential V2G pilot, with a trio of Lightning owners using Sunrun and Ford's Home Integration System. Participants can earn up to $1,000 from the program, which runs until the end of this month.Read full article Comments",

He said that the insufficient fix was meant to patch CVE-2024-10237, a high-severity vulnerability that enabled attackers to reflash firmware that runs while a machine is booting. Binarly discovered a second critical vulnerability that allows the same sort of attack. “Unprecedented persistence” Such vulnerabilities can be exploited to install firmware similar to ILObleed, an implant discovered in 2021 that infected HP Enterprise servers with wiper firmware that permanently destroyed data stored on hard drives. Even after administrators reinstalled the operating system, swapped out hard drives, or took other common disinfection steps, ILObleed would remain intact and reactivate the disk-wiping attack. The exploit the attackers used in that campaign had been patched by HP four years earlier but wasn’t installed in the compromised devices.Read full article Comments",

Now Muschietti is back with a nine-episode prequel series for HBO, IT: Welcome to Derry, exploring the origins of Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgård), the ancient evil that terrorized the fictional town every 27 years. And now we have an official trailer a month before the prequel's October debut. (Some spoilers below for IT and IT: Chapter Two.) As previously reported, set in 1989, IT essentially adapted half of King's original novel, telling the story of a group of misfit kids calling themselves \"The Losers Club.\" The kids discover their small town of Derry is home to an ancient, trans-dimensional evil that awakens every 27 years to prey mostly on children by taking the form of an evil clown named Pennywise. Bill (Jaeden Lieberher) loses his little brother, Georgie, to Pennywise, and the group decides to take on Pennywise and drive him into early hibernation, where he will hopefully starve. But Beverly (Sophia Lillis) has a vision warning that Pennywise will return on schedule in 27 years, and they must be ready to fight him anew.Read full article Comments",

They expect you to insist on paying—probably three times—before they'll take your money. This dance of refusal and counter-refusal, called taarof, governs countless daily interactions in Persian culture. And AI models are terrible at it. New research released earlier this month titled \"We Politely Insist: Your LLM Must Learn the Persian Art of Taarof\" shows that mainstream AI language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta fail to absorb these Persian social rituals, correctly navigating taarof situations only 34 to 42 percent of the time. Native Persian speakers, by contrast, get it right 82 percent of the time. This performance gap persists across large language models such as GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Llama 3, DeepSeek V3, and Dorna, a Persian-tuned variant of Llama 3. A study led by Nikta Gohari Sadr of Brock University, along with researchers from Emory University and other institutions, introduces \"TAAROFBENCH,\" the first benchmark for measuring how well AI systems reproduce this intricate cultural practice. The researchers' findings show how recent AI models default to Western-style directness, completely missing the cultural cues that govern everyday interactions for millions of Persian speakers worldwide.Read full article Comments",

As of October 21, Disney+ will cost up to 20 percent more, depending on the plan you have. Disney+ with ads is increasing from $10 to $12 per month, while the ad-free plan is going from $16 to $19 per month. The annual ad-free plan will go from $160 to $190. Acquisitions have enabled Disney to own multiple streaming services, so it’s not just Disney+ subscribers who will be impacted. Subscriptions for Hulu and ESPN Select will also increase, as will all Hulu + Live TV plans and bundles of Disney’s three subscription-based streaming services.Read full article Comments",

YouTube parent Alphabet has confirmed that it will restore channels that were banned in recent years for spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and elections. Alphabet says it values free expression and political debate, placing the blame for its previous moderation decisions on the Biden administration. Alphabet made this announcement via a lengthy letter to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio). The letter, a response to subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee, explains in no uncertain terms that the company is taking a more relaxed approach to moderating political content on YouTube. For starters, Alphabet denies that its products and services are biased toward specific viewpoints and that it \"appreciates the accountability\" provided by the committee. The cloying missive goes on to explain that Google didn't really want to ban all those accounts, but Biden administration officials just kept asking. Now that the political tables have turned, Google is looking to dig itself out of this hole.Read full article Comments",

One photo even shows neatly stacked towers of punched-out SIM card packaging, suggesting that whoever assembled the system invested some quality time in just getting the whole thing set up. The gear was identified as part of a Secret Service investigation into \"anonymous telephonic threats\" made against several high-ranking US government officials, but the setup seems designed for something larger than just making a few threats. The Secret Service believes that the system could have been capable of activities like \"disabling cell phone towers, enabling denial of services attacks, and facilitating anonymous, encrypted communication between potential threat actors and criminal enterprises.\"Read full article Comments",

The ruling allows construction to restart on Revolution Wind, which the Danish company Orsted is building in the waters off Rhode Island and Connecticut. While the preliminary injunction can still be appealed, the project is already 80 percent complete, so construction could potentially wrap up while the case is still pending. The Trump administration has made no secret of its animosity toward renewable power and issued early executive orders that blocked further offshore leases and re-evaluated the permitting process for others. But it has also gone beyond that and issued stop-work orders for sites that had already been through the permitting process and were under construction. Its reasons for doing so have been remarkably vague, with suggestions of unspecified flaws to the permitting process that involve everything from environmental impacts to detail-free national security concerns. But those reasons could apparently be ignored under the right circumstances. After blocking further construction of New York's Empire Wind, the administration lifted the block without explaining why its supposed reasons for instituting it no longer applied.Read full article Comments",

Now a Broadcom business, the platform features higher prices and a business strategy that favors big spenders.

The director requested anonymity for themself and the district out of concern about potential blowback. The director confirmed that the district has five schools and about 3,000 students. The district started using VMware’s vSAN, a software-defined storage offering, and the vSphere virtualization platform in 2019. The Indiana school system bought the VMware offerings through a package that combined them with VxRail, which is hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) hardware that Dell jointly engineered with VMware.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "It's a rare occurrence for scientists to witness sharks mating in the wild. It's even rarer to catch three leopard sharks—two males and one female—engaging in what amounts to a threesome in the wild on camera, particularly since they are considered an endangered species. But that's just what one enterprising marine biology team achieved, describing the mating sequence in careful, clinical detail in a paper published in the Journal of Ethology. It's not like scientists don't know anything about leopard shark mating behavior; rather, most of that knowledge comes from studying the sharks in captivity. Whether the behavior is identical in the wild is an open question because there hadn't been any documented observations of leopard shark mating practices in the wild—until now. Hugo Lassauce, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) in Australia, was working with the Aquarium des Lagons in Nouméa, New Caledonia, to monitor sharks off the coast of that South Pacific territory. Lassauce has been snorkeling daily with sharks for a year as part of that program—always with an accompanying boat for safety purposes—and had seen bits of the leopard shark mating behavior before, but never the entire sequence. Then he spotted a female shark on the sand below with two males hanging onto her pectoral fins—classic pre-copulation (courtship) behavior observed in captive leopard sharks.Read full article Comments",
