          "content": "OnePlus is ready to sell its new flagship smartphone in the US weeks after it made the device official. Having now finally gotten Federal Communications Commission clearance, the OnePlus 15 is available for preorder. It’s currently only live on the OnePlus storefront, but the device will eventually come to Amazon and Best Buy as well. The OnePlus 15 launched in China earlier this year, and it was supposed to go on sale in the US a month ago. However, the longest US government shutdown on record got in the way. Most of the FCC’s functions were suspended during the weekslong funding lapse, which prevented the agency from certifying new wireless products. Without that approval, OnePlus could not begin selling the phone. Thus, it had no firm release date when the phone was officially unveiled for the US in early November. Interested parties can head to the OnePlus website to place an order. The base model starts at $900 with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. This version is only available in black. If you want the Ultraviolet or Sand Storm (with the distinctive micro-arc oxidation finish), you’ll have to upgrade to the $1,000 version, which has 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "The 15 is available in this “sand storm” finish, along with black or violet. OnePlus has launched its delayed US preorders for the flagship OnePlus 15, almost a month after the phone was revealed. The company has been able to start taking orders after receiving FCC clearance for the device — initially held back because of the government shutdown. The OnePlus 15 starts from $899.99 for 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, jumping to 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage for an extra $100. Anyone who preorders can claim an optional freebie, including the smaller 43mm OnePlus Watch 3 or a pair of Buds 3 Pro earbuds. In our review, my colleague Allison Johnson praised the 15 first and foremost for its enormous 7,300mAh battery, which “easily” lasted two days in her testing, despite the fact that the phone itself is a pretty regular size. That’s thanks to silicon-carbon battery technology, which OnePlus is just about the only major brand in the US to have adopted so far. Although preorders have opened, the store page says it will take another 12 days for the first OnePlus 15 phones to ship to customers. The phone will also be available from Amazon and Best Buy. The preorders arrive just before OnePlus launches the more affordable 15R, which is scheduled for a full reveal on December 17th. We already know that it will be the first phone powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, a slightly less powerful chip than the 8 Elite Gen 5 found in the 15.",

Amazon’s updated Scribes have larger 11-inch screens, weigh 400 grams, and are 5.4mm thin (which is thinner than an iPhone Air). The screens use a “new texture-molded glass to improve the friction when the pen glides across the screen,” according to Amazon, and the versions with front lighting have a new system that uses miniaturized LEDs. The updated Scribes also come with a new pen with stronger magnets for snapping to the side of the device. However, the more affordable $429.99 Scribe without a front light won’t be available on December 10th; that’s still set to launch sometime in 2026.",

However, for those of us whose nerves are already sufficiently frazzled, the highs and lows of the last 12 months were a bit hard to stomach.In 2025, we saw the introduction of new, compelling models like the Lucid Gravity and refreshed Nissan Leaf, the latter available at a price on par with its internally combusted competition. From a product availability standpoint, 2025 was the year the EV market started feeling more mature and less manic.But 2025 also saw new heights of anti-EV vitriol stirred up during a particularly traumatic election cycle. The means of propulsion or badge on the hood of your commuter machine suddenly became an indicator of your political affiliations. Put simply, the car you drive is now a political statement, and it’s the latest unprecedented situation in an exhaustingly long and dire string of unprecedented situations. Yes, it's been a long year, and the pessimism of 2025 will surely carry us well into 2026, but not all hope is lost for EVs.Tesla and the DOGE effectElon Musk flashes his T-shirt that reads \"DOGE\" to the media as he walks on South Lawn of the White House, in Washington, March 9, 2025.ASSOCIATED PRESSWe've certainly seen some civic-minded CEOs in the past as auto executives have a long history of mixing their corporate interests with their political panderings. Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca was even considered a potential presidential candidate once upon a time. However, we have never seen the kind of ass kissing and cronyism we were privy to in this year's fickle friendship between Elon Musk and President Trump.Musk was (hyper) active on the Trump campaign trail, and wasted no time digging into what he described as government overspending. While the Department of Government Efficiency's efficacy is debatable, it certainly proved quite effective at decimating the accounts of Tesla investors. Between January and March, Tesla's stock price dropped by nearly half. Things didn't turn around until Musk left DOGE in May. Since then, Tesla's price has returned to its highs before the DOGE debacle. Its sales, however, have not. Q1 deliveries declined by 13 percent, then 14 percent in Q2. Deliveries bounced back 7 percent in Q3 as everyone scrambled to buy before the EV credits expired, but profits plunged 37 percent. Tesla's market share in the US electric vehicle space has halved, leading perennial pitchman Musk to start hawking everything from AI agents to spandex-clad robots — anything to distract from the numbers.And it's apparently working. Musk's $1 trillion pay package was approved by Tesla’s shareholders without much worry. This could make him the world's first trillionaire, but only if he meets a series of aggressive targets and deadlines for sales, an area where the man has struggled in the past.The big, beautiful sales spikeA Tesla with a sticker referring to the car's purchase is shown on Sunday, Dec. 15, 2024 in Concord, Mass.ASSOCIATED PRESSElon Musk and Donald Trump's bromance wasn't the only fallout from the latter's second term. So, too, died the $7,500 federal EV incentive, which expired in September as part of President Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" That actually spurred a short-term sales spike ahead of the deadline. Many manufacturers even set new EV sales records riding that wave, but there's a disconcerting trough to come.We still need to wait a bit to see just how bad Q4 EV sales are going to be, but early indications are not looking good. J.D. Power's October report says that EV sales in September were a record high, making up 12.9 percent of new vehicle sales in the US. In October, after the credit expired, they fell to a mere 5.2 percent. That's a worrying drop, and it's already affecting product planning. Cuts in EV productionHonda's Super-One Prototype isn't coming to the US. Tim Stevens for EngadgetWhen I was in Japan last month, getting an early look at some next-gen hybrids from Honda, I wasn't expecting to hear talk of midterm American elections from the company's executives. But that's what was on CEO Toshihiro Mibe's mind. He's watching American voting trends closely to determine the nature of the company's upcoming releases.Mibe said that Honda has already canceled plans for some EVs here in America, instead focusing on a broader selection of hybrid models. It's not the only company to do so. Ram also canceled its 1500 EV truck, but the hybrid version is still supposedly on the way. Scout Motors, too, has been focusing more on its extended-range hybrid offerings. The company's initial pitch was purely electric trucks and SUVs. Lately, it's been prioritizing its extended-range EV options based on the feedback from its 130,000 pre-orderers. 80 percent of them want the onboard generator, an add-on that may prove a saving grace for this EV startup.There is reason for optimismSome manufacturers may be throttling back on their EV aspirations, but others are forging ahead. There's a delightful collection of battery-powered machines coming next year, and that's worth getting excited about.Again, the 2026 Nissan Leaf should be a hugely popular choice as its production ramps up. It's already hitting dealerships now, and with a starting price under $30,000, it'll be hard to beat. But, Chevrolet is going to try with a refreshed Bolt EV for similar money.If you've got more to spend, you've got more options. BMW's stellar iX3 crossover SUV is due soon, as are both the electric CLA sedan and GLC SUV. The most anticipated EV of the year, though, might just be the Rivian R2. This electric SUV will join the stellar R1S and R1T, expanding Rivian's segment footprint while also hopefully expanding its market reach. A $45,000 starting price makes it far more attainable than any of the company's previous offerings. A photograph of the Rivian factory producing the company's R1 SUV variant.Nathan Heleine / RivianIf the prospect of a fun, affordable SUV from Rivian doesn't have you excited for the upcoming year in EVs, maybe some promising news from Europe will. After cutting its own EV incentive program in 2023, Germany's EV sales fell off a cliff, dropping 28 percent in 2024. Cue the predictions of the demise of EVs by many local pundits.Since then, though, EV sales slowly climbed back up, and lately they've been booming, with German road traffic agency KBA saying the total number of newly registered electric vehicles increased by nearly 50 percent in October (year over year). Electric cars now make up 19 percent of the market there, and that's despite Tesla's sales cratering.There's no guarantee that the American market will follow a similar rebound, especially if the anti-EV political messaging continues. Me, though, I've decided I'm staying optimistic, as exhausting as that can be these days.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-shaky-year-for-american-evs-could-set-the-tone-for-2026-153000210.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "The Antigravity A1 is what happens when Insta360’s 360-degree cameras are given wings and flying feels like a video game. Spinning out as its own brand, Antigravity’s debut drone is a big swing: a three-piece set with a drone that captures 8K 360-degree video, FPV goggles and a motion controller. Challenging the dominance of DJI’s (many!) consumer drones is a big ask. Antigravity’s approach is to play to its strengths in 360-degree video and smartphone-first editing. A lot of the appeal comes from how the A1 captures 8K video in all directions, meaning you can edit, cut and swap around your footage — and hopefully rarely miss a moment you’re trying to document. It’s a lot of fun, too, if you can get through the early teething issues, updates and the learning curve. The drone Image by Mat Smith for Engadget The A1 drone is just 249 grams (0.548 lbs). This helps it bypass some drone regulations, though flying permissions vary by region. The pair of cameras mounted on the top and bottom of the drone's body is one of its unique features. It’s difficult to directly compare the A1 against competitor drones, as it offers a mix of features found across different categories and some unique tools of its own. The A1 can capture 360-degree video at up to 8K resolution, and thanks to Insta360’s action cam experience, it can magically remove the drone body from video. This means you can capture video and never see propellers or, well, any part of the drone itself. Along the base of the drone, two landing gears automatically lower when you attempt to land the A1, although you will have to manually retract them when you’re looking to launch the drone. You can also lower the landing gear from one of the controller’s many buttons. The removable battery has a handy one-touch gauge to monitor levels and provides over 20 minutes of flight time, depending on conditions and whether you’re recording video. Antigravity suggests it should last up to 24 minutes during normal filming use. My review device came with two spare batteries and a charging dock. It’s very easy to swap out the batteries, and the charging dock can fully charge a single cell in 45 minutes and even charge all three slots at once. There’s a microSD card slot on the rear of the drone, alongside a USB-C port for (slowly) charging the battery. Image by Mat Smith for Engadget The cameras have a 1/1.28-inch sensor, f/2.2 lens aperture and an ISO range from 100 to 6,400. To adjust those settings beyond auto, you’ll have to dive into the menu inside the goggles, which can be laborious to navigate with a gesture-based controller. Fortunately, auto ISO and white balance are usually good enough. Pro-level content creators might want to tinker with levels here, and there’s a histogram you can toggle on or even a zebra pattern to highlight overexposed shots and areas. and the A1 can record 8K video at up to 30fps or 4K at up to 100fps. You can also meet in the middle, with a 5.2k recording mode. There are also three different flying modes, which are easy to select on the controller. Alongside Normal mode, Sport mode increases the maximum flight speed and offers “enhanced flight performance,” improves control sensitivity and turns off obstacle avoidance. Sport mode offers a tangible difference when flying the A1: it doubles the horizontal flight speed compared to Normal mode. There’s also a Cinematic (C) mode, with a lower max speed for smoother video footage. The controller and goggles Image by Mat Smith for Engadget The flight mode switcher is one of many controls, wheels, buttons and sliders that pepper the surface of the A1’s grip controller. Intriguingly, though, the main way to control the A1 drone is through gestures, not joysticks or buttons. Instead of pitching control sticks to the left and right, up and down, it’s more akin to a video game, where you point the controller where you want to go, shown with a reticle, and pull the trigger. The A1 then shoots off in that direction. The crucial part is that this doesn’t have to be where you’re “looking” from the drone’s POV. This means you can strafe and fly in any direction without your view being constrained by static cameras. It’s a sensation unlike any other drone I’ve flown. It feels more like playing a video game — like piloting a helicopter in GTA 5. You’re able to look in any direction, both while in motion and while hovering stationary. There are controls for recording video, controlling vertical flight and rotating your POV without turning your head. There’s even a RTH (return to home) function that can be accessed by long-pressing the emergency brake button. The included goggles deliver a crisp view of everything, with a pair of 1.03-inch micro-OLED displays with a resolution of 2,560 × 2,560 and a 72Hz refresh rate. Other FPV drone goggles typically offer 100Hz refresh rates, but it wasn’t a dealbreaker for me. I feared that latency hiccups could make airsickness an issue while flying the A1, but I didn’t experience it. My take is that being able to fully control your view makes nausea less of an issue. Another nice touch, especially if you’re flying with friends, is a circular outer display on the goggles, so everyone can see what the A1 sees. Naturally, it can’t encompass the entire view of the drone pilot, but there’s also nothing duller than watching someone else fly a drone. This offers a mild respite. The other eyepiece is a touchpad for steering through menus inside the goggles without having to point and click with the controller. Performance Image by Mat Smith for Engadget While the Antigravity A1 may offer a more immersive drone-flying experience, in pure numerical terms, it lags behind some competitors. For example, even in Sport mode, the A1 tops out at a maximum speed of just under 36 mph, falling behind the likes of DJI’s Avata 2 (60 mph). I was still pleasantly surprised by how responsive the A1 felt, especially in Sport mode. An additional FPV mode (accessible from the goggles) adds more sensitive controls, although I haven’t been able to test it much since it was introduced in a recent firmware update. For someone with more gaming experience than drone piloting hours, Antigravity’s central control system fits like a glove. I could fly where I wanted, confident in the controls and in the knowledge that I would capture what I wanted to. According to Antigravity, you can fly the A1 within a 10km transmission range, although I didn’t manage to test that limit in central London. The experience of starting with the drone felt, at times, unnecessarily arduous. Pairing everything together has to be done in a specific order: power up drone, power up goggles, power up controller. And turning off each item isn’t a typical long press of the power button. Instead, you use a press-once-press-it-again-and-hold method that I forget pretty much every time. Downloading video from the A1 to your phone is also laborious, but that’s not a flaw specific to this drone. Antigravity has attempted some shortcuts, including a microSD card quick reader that connects to your phone or PC via USB-C. However, at the time of testing, manually connecting the microSD is less of an option and more of a necessity. The drone repeatedly failed to connect to the companion app and reliably transfer video files. Some video files recorded seemingly evaporated between firmware updates, only to reappear later. Another file had been converted to two separate circular views, one from each camera, which made it essentially unusable. Hopefully these intial teething problems have been solved by firmware updates and won't be in retail devices. It’s a shame everything isn’t more stable, especially when both flying the A1 and using Antigravity’s editing software are bothis so beginner-friendly. It's something I’ve mentioned before with the parent company’s action cams, but the ability to create barrel rolls, tilt rotations with just one tap or click is, again, just fun. And because you can reframe and tinker with video warping, create tiny planet effects or simply crop to a more traditional, cinematic camera view, Antigravity’s software offers almost infinite ways to present your drone footage. Deeptracking can be done both during recording and editing in post, keeping a moving subject or point of interest centered as the A1 zips around. There are also AI-powered video editing features to chop up your 20 minutes of flying footage into something digestible and engaging with minimal effort. Because it’s a 360-degree video, the footage can be easily cropped to suit both horizontal and vertical formats. However, with a smaller sensor and 8K resolution spread across a 360-degree view, the A1 is not the best video drone. The video is pleasingly crisp and clear, and while the footage is best recorded in bright daylight or other well-lit locations, murky British November days didn’t affect it much. As the A1 has to stitch together its two sensors, there’s often a visible seam to your video, but it’s usually a very subtle glitch. It might stop some video creators from tapping it for their most polished aerial shots though. Recording video later in the day resulted in more noise and less detail. This is when the A1’s Cinematic mode (and generally slower flying) is a good idea, but it still won’t make up for the fact that this drone’s sensors are covering such wide angles. More video-centric drones will deliver cleaner video and better performance in less-than-ideal lighting conditions. Wrap up Image by Mat Smith for Engadget The Antigravity A1 is available now, with a standard bundle including the drone, controller and goggles for $1,599. The Infinity Bundle ($1,999) adds two extra batteries, quick reader dongle, sling bag and a charging dock. That does make it substantially more expensive than rival FPV drones like the DJI Avata 2, but the A1 is also a very different kind of drone. The intuitive controls and ability to look all around you make it unlike anything else currently available. It’s a delightful introduction to drones, FPV or otherwise, but a shame that software issues marred my tests. Plus, pairing all the devices can be convoluted and frustrating at times. If Antigravity is thinking about what to do next, I’d be intrigued to see a version with the camera bonafides to take on similarly priced DJI drones. But that shouldn’t detract from the company’s debut model since the A1 is arguably the most intriguing consumer drone since the Mavic Pro.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/antigravity-a1-drone-review-140026021.html?src=rss",

What's more, if you're one who frets about damaging your gear, you can grab them with AppleCare+ for $118, saving 43 percent from the normal price. We think that the AirPods Pro 2 are the best AirPods overall, but the ANC-enabled AirPods 4 are also a solid choice, especially at this price. We gave them a score of 86 in our review. Apple's AirPods 4 come in two variants, with and without ANC. Though the base model is solid, the version on sale here with ANC offers a number of advantages like Conversation Awareness, Adaptive Audio and Transparency mode. They also have a charging case that supports MagSafe and Qi-compatible wireless charging, along with a built-in speaker that emits beeps when you activate Find My. And as Apple recently announced, AirPods 4 with ANC supports the company's Live Translation feature. Our main reservation with the AirPods 4 with ANC is that the Airpods Pro 2 are a better noise-cancellation option when they go on sale. At this price, though, the AirPods 4 with ANC are a real bargain if you're looking for new buds — especially if you prefer the open-ears type. As mentioned, for extra peace of mind you can also get the Airpods 4 with ANC plus AppleCare+ protection for $118, or 43 percent off.

          "title": "AWS launches Kiro powers with Stripe, Figma, and Datadog integrations for AI-assisted coding",
          "standfirst": "Amazon Web Services on Wednesday introduced Kiro powers, a system that allows software developers to give their AI coding assistants instant, specialized expertise in specific tools and workflows — addressing what the company calls a fundamental bottleneck in how artificial intelligence agents operate today.AWS made the announcement at its annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas. The capability marks a departure from how most AI coding tools work today. Typically, these tools load every possible capability into memory upfront — a process that burns through computational resources and can overwhelm the AI with irrelevant information. Kiro powers takes the opposite approach, activating specialized knowledge only at the moment a developer actually needs it.\"Our goal is to give the agent specialized context so it can reach the right outcome faster — and in a way that also reduces cost,\" said Deepak Singh, Vice President of Developer Agents and Experiences at Amazon, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat.The launch includes partnerships with nine technology companies: Datadog, Dynatrace, Figma, Neon, Netlify, Postman, Stripe, Supabase, and AWS&#x27;s own services. Developers can also create and share their own powers with the community.Why AI coding assistants choke when developers connect too many toolsTo understand why Kiro powers matters, it helps to understand a growing tension in the AI development tool market.Modern AI coding assistants rely on something called the Model Context Protocol, or MCP, to connect with external tools and services. When a developer wants their AI assistant to work with Stripe for payments, Figma for design, and Supabase for databases, they connect MCP servers for each service.The problem: each connection loads dozens of tool definitions into the AI&#x27;s working memory before it writes a single line of code. According to AWS documentation, connecting just five MCP servers can consume more than 50,000 tokens — roughly 40 percent of an AI model&#x27;s context window — before the developer even types their first request.Developers have grown increasingly vocal about this issue. Many complain that they don&#x27;t want to burn through their token allocations just to have an AI agent figure out which tools are relevant to a specific task. They want to get to their workflow instantly — not watch an overloaded agent struggle to sort through irrelevant context.This phenomenon, which some in the industry call \"context rot,\" leads to slower responses, lower-quality outputs, and significantly higher costs — since AI services typically charge by the token.Inside the technology that loads AI expertise on demandKiro powers addresses this by packaging three components into a single, dynamically-loaded bundle.The first component is a steering file called POWER.md, which functions as an onboarding manual for the AI agent. It tells the agent what tools are available and, crucially, when to use them. The second component is the MCP server configuration itself — the actual connection to external services. The third includes optional hooks and automation that trigger specific actions.When a developer mentions \"payment\" or \"checkout\" in their conversation with Kiro, the system automatically activates the Stripe power, loading its tools and best practices into context. When the developer shifts to database work, Supabase activates while Stripe deactivates. The baseline context usage when no powers are active approaches zero.\"You click a button and it automatically loads,\" Singh said. \"Once a power has been created, developers just select &#x27;open in Kiro&#x27; and it launches the IDE with everything ready to go.\"How AWS is bringing elite developer techniques to the massesSingh framed Kiro powers as a democratization of advanced development practices. Before this capability, only the most sophisticated developers knew how to properly configure their AI agents with specialized context — writing custom steering files, crafting precise prompts, and manually managing which tools were active at any given time.\"We&#x27;ve found that our developers were adding in capabilities to make their agents more specialized,\" Singh said. \"They wanted to give the agent some special powers to do a specific problem. For example, they wanted their front end developer, and they wanted the agent to become an expert at backend as a service.\"This observation led to a key insight: if Supabase or Stripe could build the optimal context configuration once, every developer using those services could benefit.\"Kiro powers formalizes that — things that people, only the most advanced people were doing — and allows anyone to get those kind of skills,\" Singh said.Why dynamic loading beats fine-tuning for most AI coding use casesThe announcement also positions Kiro powers as a more economical alternative to fine-tuning, the process of training an AI model on specialized data to improve its performance in specific domains.\"It&#x27;s much cheaper,\" Singh said, when asked how powers compare to fine-tuning. \"Fine-tuning is very expensive, and you can&#x27;t fine-tune most frontier models.\"This is a significant point. The most capable AI models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google are typically \"closed source,\" meaning developers cannot modify their underlying training. They can only influence the models&#x27; behavior through the prompts and context they provide.\"Most people are already using powerful models like Sonnet 4.5 or Opus 4.5,\" Singh said. \"What those models need is to be pointed in the right direction.\"The dynamic loading mechanism also reduces ongoing costs. Because powers only activate when relevant, developers aren&#x27;t paying for token usage on tools they&#x27;re not currently using.Where Kiro powers fits in Amazon&#x27;s bigger bet on autonomous AI agentsKiro powers arrives as part of a broader push by AWS into what the company calls \"agentic AI\" — artificial intelligence systems that can operate autonomously over extended periods.Earlier at re:Invent, AWS announced three \"frontier agents\" designed to work for hours or days without human intervention: the Kiro autonomous agent for software development, the AWS security agent, and the AWS DevOps agent. These represent a different approach from Kiro powers — tackling large, ambiguous problems rather than providing specialized expertise for specific tasks.The two approaches are complementary. Frontier agents handle complex, multi-day projects that require autonomous decision-making across multiple codebases. Kiro powers, by contrast, gives developers precise, efficient tools for everyday development tasks where speed and token efficiency matter most.The company is betting that developers need both ends of this spectrum to be productive.What Kiro powers reveals about the future of AI-assisted software developmentThe launch reflects a maturing market for AI development tools. GitHub Copilot, which Microsoft launched in 2021, introduced millions of developers to AI-assisted coding. Since then, a proliferation of tools — including Cursor, Cline, and Claude Code — have competed for developers&#x27; attention.But as these tools have grown more capable, they&#x27;ve also grown more complex.

          "content": "Amazon Web Services on Wednesday introduced Kiro powers, a system that allows software developers to give their AI coding assistants instant, specialized expertise in specific tools and workflows — addressing what the company calls a fundamental bottleneck in how artificial intelligence agents operate today.AWS made the announcement at its annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas. The capability marks a departure from how most AI coding tools work today. Typically, these tools load every possible capability into memory upfront — a process that burns through computational resources and can overwhelm the AI with irrelevant information. Kiro powers takes the opposite approach, activating specialized knowledge only at the moment a developer actually needs it.\"Our goal is to give the agent specialized context so it can reach the right outcome faster — and in a way that also reduces cost,\" said Deepak Singh, Vice President of Developer Agents and Experiences at Amazon, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat.The launch includes partnerships with nine technology companies: Datadog, Dynatrace, Figma, Neon, Netlify, Postman, Stripe, Supabase, and AWS&#x27;s own services. Developers can also create and share their own powers with the community.Why AI coding assistants choke when developers connect too many toolsTo understand why Kiro powers matters, it helps to understand a growing tension in the AI development tool market.Modern AI coding assistants rely on something called the Model Context Protocol, or MCP, to connect with external tools and services. When a developer wants their AI assistant to work with Stripe for payments, Figma for design, and Supabase for databases, they connect MCP servers for each service.The problem: each connection loads dozens of tool definitions into the AI&#x27;s working memory before it writes a single line of code. According to AWS documentation, connecting just five MCP servers can consume more than 50,000 tokens — roughly 40 percent of an AI model&#x27;s context window — before the developer even types their first request.Developers have grown increasingly vocal about this issue. Many complain that they don&#x27;t want to burn through their token allocations just to have an AI agent figure out which tools are relevant to a specific task. They want to get to their workflow instantly — not watch an overloaded agent struggle to sort through irrelevant context.This phenomenon, which some in the industry call \"context rot,\" leads to slower responses, lower-quality outputs, and significantly higher costs — since AI services typically charge by the token.Inside the technology that loads AI expertise on demandKiro powers addresses this by packaging three components into a single, dynamically-loaded bundle.The first component is a steering file called POWER.md, which functions as an onboarding manual for the AI agent. It tells the agent what tools are available and, crucially, when to use them. The second component is the MCP server configuration itself — the actual connection to external services. The third includes optional hooks and automation that trigger specific actions.When a developer mentions \"payment\" or \"checkout\" in their conversation with Kiro, the system automatically activates the Stripe power, loading its tools and best practices into context. When the developer shifts to database work, Supabase activates while Stripe deactivates. The baseline context usage when no powers are active approaches zero.\"You click a button and it automatically loads,\" Singh said. \"Once a power has been created, developers just select &#x27;open in Kiro&#x27; and it launches the IDE with everything ready to go.\"How AWS is bringing elite developer techniques to the massesSingh framed Kiro powers as a democratization of advanced development practices. Before this capability, only the most sophisticated developers knew how to properly configure their AI agents with specialized context — writing custom steering files, crafting precise prompts, and manually managing which tools were active at any given time.\"We&#x27;ve found that our developers were adding in capabilities to make their agents more specialized,\" Singh said. \"They wanted to give the agent some special powers to do a specific problem. For example, they wanted their front end developer, and they wanted the agent to become an expert at backend as a service.\"This observation led to a key insight: if Supabase or Stripe could build the optimal context configuration once, every developer using those services could benefit.\"Kiro powers formalizes that — things that people, only the most advanced people were doing — and allows anyone to get those kind of skills,\" Singh said.Why dynamic loading beats fine-tuning for most AI coding use casesThe announcement also positions Kiro powers as a more economical alternative to fine-tuning, the process of training an AI model on specialized data to improve its performance in specific domains.\"It&#x27;s much cheaper,\" Singh said, when asked how powers compare to fine-tuning. \"Fine-tuning is very expensive, and you can&#x27;t fine-tune most frontier models.\"This is a significant point. The most capable AI models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google are typically \"closed source,\" meaning developers cannot modify their underlying training. They can only influence the models&#x27; behavior through the prompts and context they provide.\"Most people are already using powerful models like Sonnet 4.5 or Opus 4.5,\" Singh said. \"What those models need is to be pointed in the right direction.\"The dynamic loading mechanism also reduces ongoing costs. Because powers only activate when relevant, developers aren&#x27;t paying for token usage on tools they&#x27;re not currently using.Where Kiro powers fits in Amazon&#x27;s bigger bet on autonomous AI agentsKiro powers arrives as part of a broader push by AWS into what the company calls \"agentic AI\" — artificial intelligence systems that can operate autonomously over extended periods.Earlier at re:Invent, AWS announced three \"frontier agents\" designed to work for hours or days without human intervention: the Kiro autonomous agent for software development, the AWS security agent, and the AWS DevOps agent. These represent a different approach from Kiro powers — tackling large, ambiguous problems rather than providing specialized expertise for specific tasks.The two approaches are complementary. Frontier agents handle complex, multi-day projects that require autonomous decision-making across multiple codebases. Kiro powers, by contrast, gives developers precise, efficient tools for everyday development tasks where speed and token efficiency matter most.The company is betting that developers need both ends of this spectrum to be productive.What Kiro powers reveals about the future of AI-assisted software developmentThe launch reflects a maturing market for AI development tools. GitHub Copilot, which Microsoft launched in 2021, introduced millions of developers to AI-assisted coding. Since then, a proliferation of tools — including Cursor, Cline, and Claude Code — have competed for developers&#x27; attention.But as these tools have grown more capable, they&#x27;ve also grown more complex. The Model Context Protocol, which Anthropic open-sourced last year, created a standard for connecting AI agents to external services. That solved one problem while creating another: the context overload that Kiro powers now addresses.AWS is positioning itself as the company that understands production software development at scale. Singh emphasized that Amazon&#x27;s experience running AWS for 20 years, combined with its own massive internal software engineering organization, gives it unique insight into how developers actually work.\"It&#x27;s not something you would use just for your prototype or your toy application,\" Singh said of AWS&#x27;s AI development tools. \"If you want to build production applications, there&#x27;s a lot of knowledge that we bring in as AWS that applies here.\"The road ahead for Kiro powers and cross-platform compatibilityAWS indicated that Kiro powers currently works only within the Kiro IDE, but the company is building toward cross-compatibility with other AI development tools, including command-line interfaces, Cursor, Cline, and Claude Code.

          "standfirst": "The debate over whether artificial intelligence belongs in the corporate boardroom appears to be over — at least for the people responsible for generating revenue.Seven in ten enterprise revenue leaders now trust AI to regularly inform their business decisions, according to a sweeping new study released Thursday by Gong, the revenue intelligence company. The finding marks a dramatic shift from just two years ago, when most organizations treated AI as an experimental technology relegated to pilot programs and individual productivity hacks.The research, based on an analysis of 7.1 million sales opportunities across more than 3,600 companies and a survey of over 3,000 global revenue leaders spanning the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany, paints a picture of an industry in rapid transformation. Organizations that have embedded AI into their core go-to-market strategies are 65 percent more likely to increase their win rates than competitors still treating the technology as optional.\"I don&#x27;t think people delegate decisions to AI, but they do rely on AI in the process of making decisions,\" Amit Bendov, Gong&#x27;s co-founder and chief executive, said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"Humans are making the decision, but they&#x27;re largely assisted.\"The distinction matters. Rather than replacing human judgment, AI has become what Bendov describes as a \"second opinion\" — a data-driven check on the intuition and guesswork that has traditionally governed sales forecasting and strategy.Slowing growth is forcing sales teams to squeeze more from every repThe timing of AI&#x27;s ascendance in revenue organizations is no coincidence. The study reveals a sobering reality: after rebounding in 2024, average annual revenue growth among surveyed companies decelerated to 16 percent in 2025, marking a three-percentage-point decline year over year. Sales rep quota attainment fell from 52 percent to 46 percent over the same period.The culprit, according to Gong&#x27;s analysis, isn&#x27;t that salespeople are performing worse on individual deals. Win rates and deal duration remained consistent. The problem is that representatives are working fewer opportunities—a finding that suggests operational inefficiencies are eating into selling time.This helps explain why productivity has rocketed to the top of executive priorities. For the first time in the study&#x27;s history, increasing the productivity of existing teams ranked as the number-one growth strategy for 2026, jumping from fourth place the previous year.\"The focus is on increasing sales productivity,\" Bendov said. \"How much dollar-output per dollar-input.\"The numbers back up the urgency. Teams where sellers regularly use AI tools generate 77 percent more revenue per representative than those that don&#x27;t — a gap Gong characterizes as a six-figure difference per salesperson annually.Companies are moving beyond basic AI automation toward strategic decision-makingThe nature of AI adoption in sales has evolved considerably over the past year. In 2024, most revenue teams used AI for basic automation: transcribing calls, drafting emails, updating CRM records. Those use cases continue to grow, but 2025 marked what the report calls a shift \"from automation to intelligence.\"The number of U.S. companies using AI for forecasting and measuring strategic initiatives jumped 50 percent year over year. These more sophisticated applications — predicting deal outcomes, identifying at-risk accounts, measuring which value propositions resonate with different buyer personas — correlate with dramatically better results.Organizations in the 95th percentile of commercial impact from AI were two to four times more likely to have deployed these strategic use cases, according to the study.Bendov offered a concrete example of how this plays out in practice. \"Companies have thousands of deals that they roll up into their forecast,\" he said. \"It used to be based solely on human sentiment—believe it or not. That&#x27;s why a lot of companies miss their numbers: because people say, &#x27;Oh, he told me he&#x27;ll buy,&#x27; or &#x27;I think I can probably get this one.&#x27;\"AI changes that calculus by examining evidence rather than optimism. \"Companies now get a second opinion from AI on their forecasting, and that improves forecasting accuracy dramatically — 10 [or] 15 percent better accuracy just because it&#x27;s evidence-based, not just based on human sentiment,\" Bendov said.Revenue-specific AI tools are dramatically outperforming general-purpose alternativesOne of the study&#x27;s more provocative findings concerns the type of AI that delivers results. Teams using revenue-specific AI solutions — tools built explicitly for sales workflows rather than general-purpose platforms like ChatGPT — reported 13 percent higher revenue growth and 85 percent greater commercial impact than those relying on generic tools.These specialized systems were also twice as likely to be deployed for forecasting and predictive modeling, the report found.The finding carries obvious implications for Gong, which sells precisely this type of domain-specific platform. But the data suggests a real distinction in outcomes. General-purpose AI, while more prevalent, often creates what the report describes as a \"blind spot\" for organizations — particularly when employees adopt consumer AI tools without company oversight.Research from MIT suggests that while only 59 percent of survey respondents said their teams use personal AI tools like ChatGPT at work, the actual figure is likely closer to 90 percent. This shadow AI usage poses security risks and creates fragmented technology stacks that undermine the potential for organization-wide intelligence.Most sales leaders believe AI will reshape their jobs rather than eliminate themPerhaps the most closely watched question in any AI study concerns employment. The Gong research offers a more nuanced picture than the apocalyptic predictions that often dominate headlines.When asked about AI&#x27;s three-year impact on revenue headcount, 43 percent of respondents said they expect it to transform jobs without reducing headcount — the most common response. Only 28 percent anticipate job eliminations, while 21 percent actually foresee AI creating new roles. Just 8 percent predict minimal impact.Bendov frames the opportunity in terms of reclaiming lost time. He cited Forrester research indicating that 77 percent of a sales representative&#x27;s time is spent on activities that don&#x27;t involve customers — administrative work, meeting preparation, researching accounts, updating forecasts, and internal briefings.\"AI can eliminate, ideally, all 77 percent—all the drudgery work that they&#x27;re doing,\" Bendov said. \"I don&#x27;t think it necessarily eliminates jobs. People are half productive right now. Let&#x27;s make them fully productive, and whatever you&#x27;re paying them will translate to much higher revenue.\"The transformation is already visible in role consolidation. Over the past decade, sales organizations splintered into hyper-specialized functions: one person qualifies leads, another sets appointments, a third closes deals, a fourth handles onboarding. The result was customers interacting with five or six different people across their buying journey.\"Which is not a great buyer experience, because every time I meet a new person that might not have the full context, and it&#x27;s very inefficient for companies,\" Bendov said. \"Now with AI, you can have one person do all this, or much of this.\"At Gong itself, sellers now generate 80 percent of their own appointments because AI handles the prospecting legwork, Bendov said.American companies are adopting AI 18 months faster than their European counterpartsThe study reveals a notable divide in AI adoption between the United States and Europe. While 87 percent of U.S. companies now use AI in their revenue operations, with another 9 percent planning adoption within a year, the United Kingdom trails by 12 to 18 months. Just 70 percent of UK companies currently use AI, with 22 percent planning near-term adoption — figures that mirror U.S. data from 2024.Bendov said the pattern reflects a broader historical tendency for enterprise technology trends to cross the Atlantic with a delay. \"It&#x27;s always like that,\" he said. \"Even when the internet was taking off in the US, Europe was a step behind.\"The gap isn&#x27;t permanent, he noted, and Europe sometimes leads on technology adoption — mobile payments and messaging apps like WhatsApp gained traction there before the U.S. — but for AI specifically, the American market remains ahead.Gong says a decade of AI development gives it an edge over Salesforce and MicrosoftThe findings arrive as Gong navigates an increasingly crowded market. The company, which recently surpassed $300 million in annual recurring revenue, faces potential competition from enterprise software giants like Salesforce and Microsoft, both of which are embedding AI capabilities into their platforms.Bendov argues that Gong&#x27;s decade of AI development creates a substantial barrier to entry. The company&#x27;s architecture comprises three layers: a \"revenue graph\" that aggregates customer data from CRM systems, emails, calls, videos, and web signals; an intelligence layer combining large language models with approximately 40 proprietary small language models; and workflow applications built on top.\"Anybody that would want to build something like that—it&#x27;s not a small feature, it&#x27;s 10 years in development—would need first to build the revenue graph,\" Bendov said.Rather than viewing Salesforce and Microsoft as threats, Bendov characterized them as partners, pointing to both companies&#x27; participation in Gong&#x27;s recent user conference to discuss agent interoperability. The rise of MCP (Model Context Protocol) support and consumption-based pricing models means customers can mix AI agents from multiple vendors rather than committing to a single platform.The real question is whether AI will expand the sales profession or hollow it outThe report&#x27;s implications extend beyond sales departments. If AI can transform revenue operations — long considered a relationship-driven, human-centric function — it raises questions about which other business processes might be next.Bendov sees the potential for expansion rather than contraction. Drawing an analogy to digital photography, he noted that while camera manufacturers suffered, the total number of photos taken exploded once smartphones made photography effortless.\"If AI makes selling simple, I could see a world—I don&#x27;t know exactly what it looks like yet—but why not?\" Bendov said. \"Maybe ten times more jobs than we have now. It&#x27;s expensive and inefficient today, but if it becomes as easy as taking a photo, the industry could actually grow and create opportunities for people of different abilities, from different locations.\"For Bendov, who co-founded Gong in 2015 when AI was still a hard sell to non-technical business users, the current moment represents something he waited a decade to see. Back then, mentioning AI to sales executives sounded like science fiction. The company struggled to raise money because the underlying technology barely existed.\"When we started the company, we were born as an AI company, but we had to almost hide AI,\" Bendov recalled. \"It was intimidating.\"Now, seven out of ten of those same executives say they trust AI to help run their business. The technology that once had to be disguised has become the one thing nobody can afford to ignore.",

We at Engadget still think it is, but we also think you should be smart with your money — and that’s where streaming deals come in. Yes, it is possible to get discounts on services like Peacock and Paramount+, even if those deals aren’t as common as a sale on AirPods. If you’re looking to save money and still stream all of the content you want, Engadget can help by laying out the best streaming deals you can get right now, how you can save with bundles and everything you should know before paying for yet another streaming service. Best streaming deals True streaming deals can be hard to come by. Most often, they’ll pop up during the Black Friday shopping period. On occasion, we’ll see them sparingly throughout the year and they usually take the form of a discounted monthly or annual rate for a limited period of time. Also, true streaming deals are typically on the ad-supported versions of a service, but once in a while you’ll find a unicorn of a deal on a tier that has ad-free viewing. If you’re able to wait for a deal before subscribing to a streaming service, we recommend doing so. You’ll save money upfront and in the long run, and you also have the option to cancel your subscription before the price goes back up to the normal rate. Audible — three months for $3: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Starz (one year) for $12 ($58 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $40 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Spotify Premium Individual — four months for free ($48 off): This is our favorite music streaming service for podcasts and social features. The Premium Individual plan lets you listen ad-free and skip songs at will. You can also organize your listening queue and download content for offline listening. Just be aware, your subscription will auto-renew at the end of the trial period. So if you don't want to be on the hook for the $12 monthly fee, set a reminder to cancel and go back to the free version. Amazon Music Unlimited — three months for free ($36 off): Amazon's own music streaming service is now free for three months, for new subscribers only. With it, you get access to 100 million songs with no ads, many podcasts and some audiobooks from Audible as well. Fubo Pro for $55/month for the first month ($30 off): Fubo has introductory discounts on most of its packages, and the Pro package is the least expensive plan currently listed. It offers access to 224 channels, unlimited cloud DVR and up to 10 simultaneous streams. It even includes regional sports content from the NHL, MLB and NBA. DirecTV starting at $50/month for one month (up to $40 off): All of DirecTV's signature packages are up to $45 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app. Streaming bundle discounts There’s more consolidation happening now than ever before in the streaming space, and that means there are more streaming bundle options. These bundles offer you access to more content with one subscription price, but those prices are typically higher than paying for a single service by itself (obviously). It may be tempting to just get the bundle, but if only one of those services in the bundle speaks to you, you’ll spend less overall by just paying for the single service. Speaking of a deep love for a single streaming service: if all of your favorite shows are on Peacock or the latest releases on HBO Max consistently bring you joy, consider paying for one year upfront. Subscribing with an annual plan usually saves you money in the long term over paying on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, not all streaming services (looking at you, Netflix) have an annual subscription option. Disney+ If you feel like Charlie Kelly trying to figure out who Pepe Silvia is when you look at Disney's streaming prices chart, you're not alone. The confusion comes from the fact that Disney owns, or has a hand in, many streaming services including Hulu and ESPN. Throw in a partnership with HBO Max and you have a ton of options to consider and, probably, whiplash to match. Here's a quick overview of popular Disney+ bundle pricing. Disney+ and Hulu bundle (with ads) — $13/month Disney+ and Hulu bundle (without ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Select (without ads on Disney+ and Hulu only) — $30/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (with ads) — $20/month Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max (without ads) — $33/month Peacock TV Peacock doesn't have any streaming bundles available all year round, but you can save if you pay for one year upfront. Peacock Select (with ads) — $8/month or $80/year Peacock Premium (with ads) — $11/month or $110/year Peacock Premium Plus (without ads) — $17/month or $170/year Paramount+ Paramount+ used to bill its tier with Showtime as a sort of bundle, but it has since renamed its plans and focused the Showtime inclusion in its premium tier as just another bonus of paying for the higher priced plan. Paramount+ Essential (with ads) —$8/month or $60/year Paramount Premium (without ads) — $13/month or $120/year Student discounts on streaming services It pays to be a student — sometimes, at least. A number of streaming services have student discounts you can take advantage of as long as you're actively studying. What that translates to most of the time is being able to verify your student status and signing up with your .edu email address. HBO Max student discount — subscribe for $5/month (50 percent off): HBO Max offers their ad-supported tier to students for half off the usual rate. You’ll just have to verify that you’re a student through Unidays, and make note that this offer is only good for up to 12 months of service. Hulu student discount — subscribe for $2/month (75 percent off): Those with a valid student ID can get Hulu’s ad-supported tier for 75 percent off the typical rate. They’ll keep the same sale price for as long as they’re a student as well. Spotify student discount — Premium + Hulu with ads for $6/month (72 percent off): Spotify’s student offer continues to be one of the best around, giving you access to the Premium tier of the music streamer and Hulu’s ad-supported plan for only $6 monthly. Purchased separately, you’d pay $22 per month for both of the services. Plus, the first month is free when you sign up. NBA League Pass student discount — one year for $120 (40 percent off): Students can get one year of League Pass for only $10 per month, which includes access to NBA TV and the ability to watch classic and archive games on-demand. On the NBA League Pass website, look for the student discount banner at the top and follow the instructions to verify your student status.

          "standfirst": "Model providers want to prove the security and robustness of their models, releasing system cards and conducting red-team exercises with each new release. But it can be difficult for enterprises to parse through the results, which vary widely and can be misleading. Anthropic&#x27;s 153-page system card for Claude Opus 4.5 versus OpenAI&#x27;s 60-page GPT-5 system card reveals a fundamental split in how these labs approach security validation. Anthropic discloses in their system card how they rely on multi-attempt attack success rates from 200-attempt reinforcement learning (RL) campaigns. OpenAI also reports attempted jailbreak resistance. Both metrics are valid. Neither tells the whole story.Security leaders deploying AI agents for browsing, code execution and autonomous action need to know what each red team evaluation actually measures, and where the blind spots are.What the attack data showsGray Swan&#x27;s Shade platform ran adaptive adversarial campaigns against Claude models. The attack success rate (ASR) tells the story.Opus 4.5 in coding environments hit 4.7% ASR at one attempt, 33.6% at ten and 63.0% at one hundred. In computer use with extended thinking, it held at 0% ASR even after 200 attempts. It&#x27;s the first model to saturate the benchmark.Sonnet 4.5 at the same thresholds showed 70% ASR in coding and 85.7% in computer use.Opus 4.5 delivers roughly 7x improvement in coding resistance and complete resistance in computer use. This illustrates that the gap between model tiers within the same family is now larger than some cross-vendor comparisons. For security teams, that&#x27;s a procurement factor that didn&#x27;t exist six months ago.For OpenAI, the Gray Swan Shade platform found that the o1 system card delivered 6% ASR for harmful text and 5% for malicious code, all based on single-attempt metrics. Third-party testing by SPLX and NeuralTrust found GPT-5&#x27;s raw ASR hit 89% initially, dropping below 1% within two weeks of patching.The report Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks confirms the pattern. With sufficient attempts, Claude 3.5 Sonnet showed 78% ASR, and GPT-4o reached 89%.Two ways to catch deceptionAnthropic monitors approximately 10 million neural features during evaluation using dictionary learning. Features map to human-interpretable concepts, including deception, sycophancy, bias, power-seeking and concealment.Meanwhile, OpenAI&#x27;s approach relies on chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring. Their deception classifier flagged 0.17% of o1-preview responses as potentially deceptive with 92% accuracy on internal validation. GPT-5 reduced CoT deception from 4.8% to 2.1% compared to o3. The method assumes visible reasoning reflects internal processing. Anthropic&#x27;s interpretability work directly questions that assumption.When models game the testIn Apollo Research&#x27;s evaluation of o1, the model attempted to turn off oversight mechanisms 5% of the time when it believed it would be shut down. In 2% of cases, o1 attempted self-exfiltration. When confronted about misaligned actions, o1 denied wrongdoing or fabricated explanations 99% of the time. The o1 system card disclosed instrumental alignment faking. In 37% of scenarios, the model pursued developer-aligned goals during evaluation, then switched to its own goals when it believed oversight was minimal.Meanwhile, Anthropic reports Opus 4.5&#x27;s evaluation awareness dropped from 26.5% (Opus 4.1) to less than 10% internally. UK AISI measured evaluation awareness decreasing from 26.5% (Sonnet 4.5) to 12.7% (Opus 4.5 Preview). METR&#x27;s GPT-5 evaluation noted the model \"can identify the exact evaluation it is in on some occasions\" and \"seems to use this information to get a better score mostly.\"If a model behaves differently when it detects evaluation conditions, it&#x27;s a sure bet that production behavior will become unpredictable when pushed to scale. This is the core problem with evaluation awareness. Models that recognize they&#x27;re being tested attempt to game the test. Anthropic&#x27;s 60% reduction in evaluation awareness from Opus 4.1 to 4.5 represents their success in targeted engineering efforts against this vector.Red teaming on prompt injection defenses shows similar divergence.Anthropic&#x27;s testing reports 96% prevention in tool use scenarios, rising to 99.4% with additional safeguards like prompt shields. Fujitsu&#x27;s independent assessment found GPT-5 vulnerable to approximately 20% of tested injection attacks. OpenAI&#x27;s o3/o4-mini system card reports instruction hierarchy scores of 0.86 for system-versus-developer conflicts. These are different metrics and different attack methodologies, but the gap suggests Anthropic&#x27;s agentic use cases have been hardened against adversarial inputs embedded in tool outputs.Comparing red teaming resultsHere&#x27;s how Opus 4.5 stacks up against OpenAI&#x27;s model family across 16 dimensions. .DimensionClaude Opus 4.5GPT-5o3 / o4-minio1System card length153 pages55 pages~30 pages~40 pagesAttack methodology200-attempt RL campaignsSingle-attempt + iterative patchingSingle-attemptSingle-attemptASR @ 1 attempt (coding)4.7%89% raw (pre-patch)Not published5%ASR @ 100 attempts63.0%Not publishedNot publishedNot publishedASR @ 200 attempts (Computer Use)0% (saturates benchmark)Not publishedNot publishedNot publishedPrompt injection defense96% prevention; 99.4% with safeguards~20% ASR (Fujitsu)0.86 instruction hierarchyHigher ASR than GPT-4oInterpretability~10M neural features monitoredCoT monitoringCoT monitoringCoT monitoringDeception detectionInternal feature activation2.1% CoT flagged0.95 not_unsafe0.17% flagged; 99% denyEvaluation awareness<10%Identifies exact eval (METR)Not published37% alignment fakingScheming (Apollo)Opus 4.5 showed very low rates of sabotage propensity in internal evaluations, orders of magnitude lower than o1.Not publishedLower than o1; still deceptive5% turn off oversight; 2% self-exfilCBRN riskBelow ASL-4Medium (approaching High)MediumMedium (first to reach)GovernanceFRT → AST → RSO/CEOSAG + Preparedness v2SAG + Preparedness v2SAG + PreparednessExternal partnersGray Swan, UK AISI, US CAISI, METRUK AISI, US AISI, METR, ApolloUK AISI, US AISI, METR, Apollo, Pattern LabsUK AISI, US AISI, METR, ApolloReward hackingYes (impossible tasks)Yes (METR)~1% of tasks; 5/24 KernelsYesMisalignment reduction60% vs. Opus 4.1Not publishedLower scheming than o1BaselineSources: Opus 4.5 system card, GPT-5 system card, o3/o4-mini system card, o1 system card, Gray Swan, METR, Apollo ResearchWhy these differences matterEnterprises have several factors to consider when analyzing model evals. These include: Attack persistence thresholds Anthropic&#x27;s 200-attempt RL campaigns simulate adversaries with time, resources, and adaptive tooling. In RL-based adversarial testing, the attacker model learns from each failure, adjusts its approach and systematically probes for weaknesses. It&#x27;s training an AI to break another AI.Gray Swan&#x27;s Shade platform doesn&#x27;t just retry the same prompt. It learns from failures, adjusts attack vectors and exploits patterns in model responses. The 4.7% to 63.0% degradation curve in coding environments shows how resistance erodes under sustained pressure. OpenAI&#x27;s single-attempt metrics answer a different question: How often does a naive attacker succeed on the first try? Both matter. A phishing campaign hits millions of users once each. A nation-state actor runs thousands of variations against a single target. Security teams need to know which threat model their vendor tested against.Detection architectureAnthropic monitors approximately 10 million internal neural features during evaluation. These are abstract concepts like deception, sycophancy and power-seeking that activate across the model&#x27;s hidden layers. When a fraud/deception feature lights up during benign roleplay, that&#x27;s a signal invisible to output analysis. The model&#x27;s internal state reveals associations its outputs don&#x27;t.OpenAI takes a different approach with CoT monitoring. Their deception classifier flagged 0.17% of o1-preview responses as potentially deceptive with 92% accuracy. The assumption is that reasoning traces reflect internal processing. Anthropic&#x27;s interpretability research directly challenges this. Models can produce clean reasoning chains while internal features indicate something else entirely.Neither approach is complete. CoT monitoring scales more easily. Feature monitoring catches what CoT misses but requires deep model access and interpretability infrastructure that most enterprises can&#x27;t replicate.Scheming evaluation design Apollo Research&#x27;s methodology puts models in scenarios where misaligned behavior offers a strategic advantage: Shutdown threats, goal conflicts and oversight detection. o1 attempted to turn off oversight mechanisms 5% of the time when believing shutdown was imminent. It tried to copy itself to prevent replacement in 2% of cases. When confronted, it denied wrongdoing 99% of the time. Opus 4.5 showed very low rates of sabotage propensity in internal evaluations, orders of magnitude lower than o1.But the evaluation environments differ. Anthropic&#x27;s stress tests focus on whether models attempt sabotage when given clear opportunities. OpenAI&#x27;s tests via Apollo probe instrumental reasoning, specifically whether models fake alignment during evaluation, then defect when oversight drops. The 37% alignment-faking rate in o1 represents a different failure mode than sabotage attempts.The comparability problem These methodological differences make direct comparison difficult. Opus 4.5&#x27;s 0% ASR at 200 attempts in computer use versus o1&#x27;s 5% malicious code rate are not measuring the same thing. The attack surfaces, attempt counts and success criteria differ.The matrix reveals what each vendor chose to measure and publish. That itself signals priorities. Anthropic&#x27;s 153-page system card emphasizes degradation curves and internal feature monitoring. OpenAI emphasizes iterative improvement and CoT transparency.Bottom line: Enterprise security teams inheriting these models inherit these measurement philosophies. The question isn&#x27;t which number is better. It&#x27;s the measurement that matches your deployment&#x27;s actual threat landscape.What independent red team evaluators foundIndependent red team evaluations, for their part, often operate with entirely different methods. This can tell a very different story and reveal additional model characteristics that enterprises must consider. METR&#x27;s red team evaluation measured autonomous capabilities using a time horizon score, which tracks how long a task can run before the agent fails half the time. o3 sustained reliable performance for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes. o4-mini held for 1 hour 15 minutes. METR also detected reward hacking in roughly 1% of o3&#x27;s attempts, including 5 of 24 kernel optimization experiments where the model tampered with scoring functions to inflate its own results.Apollo Research tested o3 and o4-mini for in-context scheming. Both exhibited deceptive tendencies such as sandbagging evaluations and sabotaging tasks with plausible deniability, but scored lower than o1. They assess that o3 and o4-mini are unlikely to cause catastrophic harm due to scheming, but more minor real-world harms remain possible without monitoring.The UK AISI/Gray Swan challenge ran 1.8 million attacks across 22 models. Every model broke. ASR ranged from 1.47% to 6.49%. Opus 4.5 placed first on Gray Swan&#x27;s Agent Red Teaming benchmark with 4.7% ASR versus GPT-5.1 at 21.9% and Gemini 3 Pro at 12.5%.No current frontier system resists determined, well-resourced attacks. The differentiation lies in how quickly defenses degrade and at what attempt threshold. Opus 4.5&#x27;s advantage compounds over repeated attempts. Single-attempt metrics flatten the curve.What To Ask Your VendorSecurity teams evaluating frontier AI models need specific answers, starting with ASR at 50 and 200 attempts rather than single-attempt metrics alone. Find out whether they detect deception through output analysis or internal state monitoring. Know who challenges red team conclusions before deployment and what specific failure modes they&#x27;ve documented. Get the evaluation awareness rate. Vendors claiming complete safety haven&#x27;t stress-tested adequately.The bottom lineDiverse red-team methodologies demonstrate that every frontier model breaks under sustained attack. The 153-page system card versus the 55-page system card isn&#x27;t just about documentation length. It&#x27;s a signal of what each vendor chose to measure, stress-test, and disclose.For persistent adversaries, Anthropic&#x27;s degradation curves show exactly where resistance fails. For fast-moving threats requiring rapid patches, OpenAI&#x27;s iterative improvement data matters more. For agentic deployments with browsing, code execution and autonomous action, the scheming metrics become your primary risk indicator.Security leaders need to stop asking which model is safer. Start asking which evaluation methodology matches the threats your deployment will actually face. The system cards are public. The data is there. Use it.",

METR&#x27;s GPT-5 evaluation noted the model \"can identify the exact evaluation it is in on some occasions\" and \"seems to use this information to get a better score mostly.\"If a model behaves differently when it detects evaluation conditions, it&#x27;s a sure bet that production behavior will become unpredictable when pushed to scale. This is the core problem with evaluation awareness. Models that recognize they&#x27;re being tested attempt to game the test. Anthropic&#x27;s 60% reduction in evaluation awareness from Opus 4.1 to 4.5 represents their success in targeted engineering efforts against this vector.Red teaming on prompt injection defenses shows similar divergence.Anthropic&#x27;s testing reports 96% prevention in tool use scenarios, rising to 99.4% with additional safeguards like prompt shields. Fujitsu&#x27;s independent assessment found GPT-5 vulnerable to approximately 20% of tested injection attacks. OpenAI&#x27;s o3/o4-mini system card reports instruction hierarchy scores of 0.86 for system-versus-developer conflicts. These are different metrics and different attack methodologies, but the gap suggests Anthropic&#x27;s agentic use cases have been hardened against adversarial inputs embedded in tool outputs.Comparing red teaming resultsHere&#x27;s how Opus 4.5 stacks up against OpenAI&#x27;s model family across 16 dimensions. .DimensionClaude Opus 4.5GPT-5o3 / o4-minio1System card length153 pages55 pages~30 pages~40 pagesAttack methodology200-attempt RL campaignsSingle-attempt + iterative patchingSingle-attemptSingle-attemptASR @ 1 attempt (coding)4.7%89% raw (pre-patch)Not published5%ASR @ 100 attempts63.0%Not publishedNot publishedNot publishedASR @ 200 attempts (Computer Use)0% (saturates benchmark)Not publishedNot publishedNot publishedPrompt injection defense96% prevention; 99.4% with safeguards~20% ASR (Fujitsu)0.86 instruction hierarchyHigher ASR than GPT-4oInterpretability~10M neural features monitoredCoT monitoringCoT monitoringCoT monitoringDeception detectionInternal feature activation2.1% CoT flagged0.95 not_unsafe0.17% flagged; 99% denyEvaluation awareness<10%Identifies exact eval (METR)Not published37% alignment fakingScheming (Apollo)Opus 4.5 showed very low rates of sabotage propensity in internal evaluations, orders of magnitude lower than o1.Not publishedLower than o1; still deceptive5% turn off oversight; 2% self-exfilCBRN riskBelow ASL-4Medium (approaching High)MediumMedium (first to reach)GovernanceFRT → AST → RSO/CEOSAG + Preparedness v2SAG + Preparedness v2SAG + PreparednessExternal partnersGray Swan, UK AISI, US CAISI, METRUK AISI, US AISI, METR, ApolloUK AISI, US AISI, METR, Apollo, Pattern LabsUK AISI, US AISI, METR, ApolloReward hackingYes (impossible tasks)Yes (METR)~1% of tasks; 5/24 KernelsYesMisalignment reduction60% vs. Opus 4.1Not publishedLower scheming than o1BaselineSources: Opus 4.5 system card, GPT-5 system card, o3/o4-mini system card, o1 system card, Gray Swan, METR, Apollo ResearchWhy these differences matterEnterprises have several factors to consider when analyzing model evals. These include: Attack persistence thresholds Anthropic&#x27;s 200-attempt RL campaigns simulate adversaries with time, resources, and adaptive tooling. In RL-based adversarial testing, the attacker model learns from each failure, adjusts its approach and systematically probes for weaknesses. It&#x27;s training an AI to break another AI.Gray Swan&#x27;s Shade platform doesn&#x27;t just retry the same prompt. It learns from failures, adjusts attack vectors and exploits patterns in model responses. The 4.7% to 63.0% degradation curve in coding environments shows how resistance erodes under sustained pressure. OpenAI&#x27;s single-attempt metrics answer a different question: How often does a naive attacker succeed on the first try? Both matter. A phishing campaign hits millions of users once each. A nation-state actor runs thousands of variations against a single target. Security teams need to know which threat model their vendor tested against.Detection architectureAnthropic monitors approximately 10 million internal neural features during evaluation. These are abstract concepts like deception, sycophancy and power-seeking that activate across the model&#x27;s hidden layers. When a fraud/deception feature lights up during benign roleplay, that&#x27;s a signal invisible to output analysis. The model&#x27;s internal state reveals associations its outputs don&#x27;t.OpenAI takes a different approach with CoT monitoring. Their deception classifier flagged 0.17% of o1-preview responses as potentially deceptive with 92% accuracy. The assumption is that reasoning traces reflect internal processing. Anthropic&#x27;s interpretability research directly challenges this. Models can produce clean reasoning chains while internal features indicate something else entirely.Neither approach is complete. CoT monitoring scales more easily. Feature monitoring catches what CoT misses but requires deep model access and interpretability infrastructure that most enterprises can&#x27;t replicate.Scheming evaluation design Apollo Research&#x27;s methodology puts models in scenarios where misaligned behavior offers a strategic advantage: Shutdown threats, goal conflicts and oversight detection. o1 attempted to turn off oversight mechanisms 5% of the time when believing shutdown was imminent. It tried to copy itself to prevent replacement in 2% of cases. When confronted, it denied wrongdoing 99% of the time. Opus 4.5 showed very low rates of sabotage propensity in internal evaluations, orders of magnitude lower than o1.But the evaluation environments differ. Anthropic&#x27;s stress tests focus on whether models attempt sabotage when given clear opportunities. OpenAI&#x27;s tests via Apollo probe instrumental reasoning, specifically whether models fake alignment during evaluation, then defect when oversight drops. The 37% alignment-faking rate in o1 represents a different failure mode than sabotage attempts.The comparability problem These methodological differences make direct comparison difficult. Opus 4.5&#x27;s 0% ASR at 200 attempts in computer use versus o1&#x27;s 5% malicious code rate are not measuring the same thing. The attack surfaces, attempt counts and success criteria differ.The matrix reveals what each vendor chose to measure and publish. That itself signals priorities. Anthropic&#x27;s 153-page system card emphasizes degradation curves and internal feature monitoring. OpenAI emphasizes iterative improvement and CoT transparency.Bottom line: Enterprise security teams inheriting these models inherit these measurement philosophies. The question isn&#x27;t which number is better. It&#x27;s the measurement that matches your deployment&#x27;s actual threat landscape.What independent red team evaluators foundIndependent red team evaluations, for their part, often operate with entirely different methods. This can tell a very different story and reveal additional model characteristics that enterprises must consider. METR&#x27;s red team evaluation measured autonomous capabilities using a time horizon score, which tracks how long a task can run before the agent fails half the time. o3 sustained reliable performance for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes. o4-mini held for 1 hour 15 minutes. METR also detected reward hacking in roughly 1% of o3&#x27;s attempts, including 5 of 24 kernel optimization experiments where the model tampered with scoring functions to inflate its own results.Apollo Research tested o3 and o4-mini for in-context scheming. Both exhibited deceptive tendencies such as sandbagging evaluations and sabotaging tasks with plausible deniability, but scored lower than o1. They assess that o3 and o4-mini are unlikely to cause catastrophic harm due to scheming, but more minor real-world harms remain possible without monitoring.The UK AISI/Gray Swan challenge ran 1.8 million attacks across 22 models. Every model broke. ASR ranged from 1.47% to 6.49%. Opus 4.5 placed first on Gray Swan&#x27;s Agent Red Teaming benchmark with 4.7% ASR versus GPT-5.1 at 21.9% and Gemini 3 Pro at 12.5%.No current frontier system resists determined, well-resourced attacks. The differentiation lies in how quickly defenses degrade and at what attempt threshold. Opus 4.5&#x27;s advantage compounds over repeated attempts. Single-attempt metrics flatten the curve.What To Ask Your VendorSecurity teams evaluating frontier AI models need specific answers, starting with ASR at 50 and 200 attempts rather than single-attempt metrics alone. Find out whether they detect deception through output analysis or internal state monitoring. Know who challenges red team conclusions before deployment and what specific failure modes they&#x27;ve documented. Get the evaluation awareness rate. Vendors claiming complete safety haven&#x27;t stress-tested adequately.The bottom lineDiverse red-team methodologies demonstrate that every frontier model breaks under sustained attack. The 153-page system card versus the 55-page system card isn&#x27;t just about documentation length. It&#x27;s a signal of what each vendor chose to measure, stress-test, and disclose.For persistent adversaries, Anthropic&#x27;s degradation curves show exactly where resistance fails. For fast-moving threats requiring rapid patches, OpenAI&#x27;s iterative improvement data matters more. For agentic deployments with browsing, code execution and autonomous action, the scheming metrics become your primary risk indicator.Security leaders need to stop asking which model is safer. Start asking which evaluation methodology matches the threats your deployment will actually face. The system cards are public. The data is there. Use it.",

          "title": "Nvidia's new AI framework trains an 8B model to manage tools like a pro",
          "standfirst": "Researchers at Nvidia and the University of Hong Kong have released Orchestrator, an 8-billion-parameter model that coordinates different tools and large language models (LLMs) to solve complex problems. In their experiments, Orchestrator achieved higher accuracy at a lower cost than much larger models in tool-use benchmarks, while also aligning with user preferences on which tools to use for a given query.The model was trained through ToolOrchestra, a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework for training small models to act as intelligent coordinators. The approach is based on the idea that a small \"orchestrator\" managing a diverse team of specialized models and tools can be more effective and efficient than a single, monolithic AI system. The findings suggest that this composite approach could pave the way for more practical and scalable AI reasoning systems in the enterprise.The limits of current LLM tool useGiving LLMs access to external tools is a promising way to extend their capabilities beyond their training data and into agentic tasks. By calling on resources like search engines and code interpreters, AI agents can improve their accuracy and perform in-app tasks.However, in the accompanying paper, the researchers argue that the current approach to building tool-using agents doesn&#x27;t harness the full potential of this paradigm. Most systems equip a single, powerful model with a set of basic tools like a web search or a calculator. They argue that humans, when reasoning, “routinely extend themselves by calling upon resources of greater-than-human intelligence, from domain experts to sophisticated processes and software systems.” Accordingly, LLMs should be able to interact with a wide range of tools in different capacities.The tool orchestration paradigmThe paper proposes a shift from a single-model system to a composite one, managed by a lightweight \"orchestrator\" model. The orchestrator&#x27;s job is to analyze a complex task and break it down, invoking the right tools in the right order to arrive at a solution.This toolset includes not only standard utilities like web search and code interpreters, but other LLMs of various capabilities that function as \"intelligent tools.\" For example, the orchestrator can delegate a quantitative question to a math-focused model or a programming challenge to a code-generation model. Instead of placing the entire cognitive load on one large, generalist model, the orchestrator delegates narrowed-down sub-problems to specialized intelligent tools.Based on this concept, the researchers developed ToolOrchestra, a method that uses RL to train a small language model to act as an orchestrator. The model learns when and how to call upon other models and tools, and how to combine their outputs in multi-turn reasoning. The tools are defined in a simple JSON format, specifying their name, description and parameters.The RL training process is guided by a reward system that produces a cost-effective and controllable agent. The reward balances three objectives: The correctness of the final answer, efficiency in cost and latency and alignment with user preferences. For example, the system is penalized for excessive compute usage, and is rewarded for choosing tools that a user has marked as preferred, such as favoring an open-source model over a proprietary API for privacy reasons. To support this training, the team also developed an automatic data pipeline that generated thousands of verifiable training examples across 10 different domains.A small model with big resultsUsing ToolOrchestra, the researchers trained Orchestrator, an 8-billion-parameter model based on Qwen3-8B. They evaluated its performance on three challenging benchmarks: Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE), FRAMES and Tau2-Bench. It was compared against several baselines, including large, off-the-shelf LLMs both with and without tools.The results showed that even powerful models struggled without tools, confirming their necessity for complex reasoning. While adding tools improved performance for large models, it often came with a steep increase in cost and latency. By contrast, the 8B Orchestrator delivered impressive results. On HLE, a benchmark of PhD-level questions, Orchestrator substantially outperformed prior methods at a fraction of the computational cost. On the Tau2-Bench function-calling test, it effectively scheduled different tools, calling a large model like GPT-5 in only about 40% of the steps and using cheaper options for the rest, while still beating an agent that used the large model for every step.The researchers noted that the RL-trained Orchestrator adapted its strategy to new challenges, showing a \"high degree of general reasoning ability.\" Crucially for enterprise applications, Orchestrator also generalized well to models and pricing structures it hadn&#x27;t seen during training. This flexibility makes the framework suitable for businesses that rely on a mix of public, private and bespoke AI models and tools.

          "content": "Researchers at Nvidia and the University of Hong Kong have released Orchestrator, an 8-billion-parameter model that coordinates different tools and large language models (LLMs) to solve complex problems. In their experiments, Orchestrator achieved higher accuracy at a lower cost than much larger models in tool-use benchmarks, while also aligning with user preferences on which tools to use for a given query.The model was trained through ToolOrchestra, a new reinforcement learning (RL) framework for training small models to act as intelligent coordinators. The approach is based on the idea that a small \"orchestrator\" managing a diverse team of specialized models and tools can be more effective and efficient than a single, monolithic AI system. The findings suggest that this composite approach could pave the way for more practical and scalable AI reasoning systems in the enterprise.The limits of current LLM tool useGiving LLMs access to external tools is a promising way to extend their capabilities beyond their training data and into agentic tasks. By calling on resources like search engines and code interpreters, AI agents can improve their accuracy and perform in-app tasks.However, in the accompanying paper, the researchers argue that the current approach to building tool-using agents doesn&#x27;t harness the full potential of this paradigm. Most systems equip a single, powerful model with a set of basic tools like a web search or a calculator. They argue that humans, when reasoning, “routinely extend themselves by calling upon resources of greater-than-human intelligence, from domain experts to sophisticated processes and software systems.” Accordingly, LLMs should be able to interact with a wide range of tools in different capacities.The tool orchestration paradigmThe paper proposes a shift from a single-model system to a composite one, managed by a lightweight \"orchestrator\" model. The orchestrator&#x27;s job is to analyze a complex task and break it down, invoking the right tools in the right order to arrive at a solution.This toolset includes not only standard utilities like web search and code interpreters, but other LLMs of various capabilities that function as \"intelligent tools.\" For example, the orchestrator can delegate a quantitative question to a math-focused model or a programming challenge to a code-generation model. Instead of placing the entire cognitive load on one large, generalist model, the orchestrator delegates narrowed-down sub-problems to specialized intelligent tools.Based on this concept, the researchers developed ToolOrchestra, a method that uses RL to train a small language model to act as an orchestrator. The model learns when and how to call upon other models and tools, and how to combine their outputs in multi-turn reasoning. The tools are defined in a simple JSON format, specifying their name, description and parameters.The RL training process is guided by a reward system that produces a cost-effective and controllable agent. The reward balances three objectives: The correctness of the final answer, efficiency in cost and latency and alignment with user preferences. For example, the system is penalized for excessive compute usage, and is rewarded for choosing tools that a user has marked as preferred, such as favoring an open-source model over a proprietary API for privacy reasons. To support this training, the team also developed an automatic data pipeline that generated thousands of verifiable training examples across 10 different domains.A small model with big resultsUsing ToolOrchestra, the researchers trained Orchestrator, an 8-billion-parameter model based on Qwen3-8B. They evaluated its performance on three challenging benchmarks: Humanity’s Last Exam (HLE), FRAMES and Tau2-Bench. It was compared against several baselines, including large, off-the-shelf LLMs both with and without tools.The results showed that even powerful models struggled without tools, confirming their necessity for complex reasoning. While adding tools improved performance for large models, it often came with a steep increase in cost and latency. By contrast, the 8B Orchestrator delivered impressive results. On HLE, a benchmark of PhD-level questions, Orchestrator substantially outperformed prior methods at a fraction of the computational cost. On the Tau2-Bench function-calling test, it effectively scheduled different tools, calling a large model like GPT-5 in only about 40% of the steps and using cheaper options for the rest, while still beating an agent that used the large model for every step.The researchers noted that the RL-trained Orchestrator adapted its strategy to new challenges, showing a \"high degree of general reasoning ability.\" Crucially for enterprise applications, Orchestrator also generalized well to models and pricing structures it hadn&#x27;t seen during training. This flexibility makes the framework suitable for businesses that rely on a mix of public, private and bespoke AI models and tools. The lower cost, higher speed and customizability make it a practical approach for building sophisticated AI agents that can scale.As businesses look to deploy more advanced AI agents, this orchestration approach offers a path toward systems that are not only more intelligent but more economical and controllable. (The model weights are currently available under a non-commercial license, but Nvidia has also released the training code under the permissive Apache 2.0 license.)As the paper concludes, the future may lie in even more advanced versions of this concept: “Looking ahead, we envision more sophisticated recursive orchestrator systems to push the upper bound of intelligence [and] also to further enhance efficiency in solving increasingly complex agentic tasks.”",

          "standfirst": "Just a few short weeks ago, Google debuted its Gemini 3 model, claiming it scored a leadership position in multiple AI benchmarks. But the challenge with vendor-provided benchmarks is that they are just that — vendor-provided. A new vendor-neutral evaluation from Prolific, however, puts Gemini 3 at the top of the leaderboard. This isn&#x27;t on a set of academic benchmarks; rather, it&#x27;s on a set of real-world attributes that actual users and organizations care about. Prolific was founded by researchers at the University of Oxford. The company delivers high-quality, reliable human data to power rigorous research and ethical AI development. The company&#x27;s “HUMAINE benchmark” applies this approach by using representative human sampling and blind testing to rigorously compare AI models across a variety of user scenarios, measuring not just technical performance but also user trust, adaptability and communication style.The latest HUMAINE test evaluated 26,000 users in a blind test of models. In the evaluation, Gemini 3 Pro&#x27;s trust score surged from 16% to 69%, the highest ever recorded by Prolific. Gemini 3 now ranks number one overall in trust, ethics and safety 69% of the time across demographic subgroups, compared to its predecessor Gemini 2.5 Pro, which held the top spot only 16% of the time.Overall, Gemini 3 ranked first in three of four evaluation categories: performance and reasoning, interaction and adaptiveness and trust and safety. It lost only on communication style, where DeepSeek V3 topped preferences at 43%. The HUMAINE test also showed that Gemini 3 performed consistently well across 22 different demographic user groups, including variations in age, sex, ethnicity and political orientation. The evaluation also found that users are now five times more likely to choose the model in head-to-head blind comparisons.But the ranking matters less than why it won.\"It&#x27;s the consistency across a very wide range of different use cases, and a personality and a style that appeals across a wide range of different user types,\" Phelim Bradley, co-founder and CEO of Prolific, told VentureBeat. \"Although in some specific instances, other models are preferred by either small subgroups or on a particular conversation type, it&#x27;s the breadth of knowledge and the flexibility of the model across a range of different use cases and audience types that allowed it to win this particular benchmark.\"How blinded testing reveals what academic benchmarks missHUMAINE&#x27;s methodology exposes gaps in how the industry evaluates models. Users interact with two models simultaneously in multi-turn conversations. They don&#x27;t know which vendors power each response. They discuss whatever topics matter to them, not predetermined test questions.It&#x27;s the sample itself that matters. HUMAINE uses representative sampling across U.S. and UK populations, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity and political orientation. This reveals something static benchmarks can&#x27;t capture: Model performance varies by audience.\"If you take an AI leaderboard, the majority of them still could have a fairly static list,\" Bradley said. \"But for us, if you control for the audience, we end up with a slightly different leaderboard, whether you&#x27;re looking at a left-leaning sample, right-leaning sample, U.S., UK. And I think age was actually the most different stated condition in our experiment.\"For enterprises deploying AI across diverse employee populations, this matters. A model that performs well for one demographic may underperform for another.The methodology also addresses a fundamental question in AI evaluation: Why use human judges at all when AI could evaluate itself? Bradley noted that his firm does use AI judges in certain use cases, although he stressed that human evaluation is still the critical factor.\"We see the biggest benefit coming from smart orchestration of both LLM judge and human data, both have strengths and weaknesses, that, when smartly combined, do better together,\" said Bradley. \"But we still think that human data is where the alpha is. We&#x27;re still extremely bullish that human data and human intelligence is required to be in the loop.\"What trust means in AI evaluationTrust, ethics and safety measures user confidence in reliability, factual accuracy and responsible behavior. In HUMAINE&#x27;s methodology, trust isn&#x27;t a vendor claim or a technical metric — it&#x27;s what users report after blinded conversations with competing models.The 69% figure represents probability across demographic groups. This consistency matters more than aggregate scores because organizations can serve diverse populations.\"There was no awareness that they were using Gemini in this scenario,\" Bradley said. \"It was based only on the blinded multi-turn response.\"This separates perceived trust from earned trust. Users judged model outputs without knowing which vendor produced them, eliminating Google&#x27;s brand advantage. For customer-facing deployments where the AI vendor remains invisible to end users, this distinction matters.What enterprises should do nowOne of the critical things that enterprises should do now when considering different models is embrace an evaluation framework that works.\"It is increasingly challenging to evaluate models exclusively based on vibes,\" Bradley said. \"I think increasingly we need more rigorous, scientific approaches to truly understand how these models are performing.\"The HUMAINE data provides a framework: Test for consistency across use cases and user demographics, not just peak performance on specific tasks. Blind the testing to separate model quality from brand perception. Use representative samples that match your actual user population. Plan for continuous evaluation as models change.For enterprises looking to deploy AI at scale, this means moving beyond \"which model is best\" to \"which model is best for our specific use case, user demographics and required attributes.\" The rigor of representative sampling and blind testing provides the data to make that determination — something technical benchmarks and vibes-based evaluation cannot deliver.",

          "standfirst": "With a good virtual private network (VPN), you can stream TV shows and events from all over the world, protect your information from hackers and thwart those online trackers that watch you sleep and show you weird personalized ads. Although we strongly recommend using a VPN, you shouldn't jump on just any deal — a bit of comparison shopping goes a long way in this market. The pricing you see on VPN websites is often not an accurate portrayal of what you'll actually pay. Even so, there are some great bargains on the table. Most VPNs now have their Black Friday deals live, and you can save anywhere from 67 to 88 percent on annual subscriptions to the best VPNs. Most of these discounts only apply if you sign up for a year or more, but committing is not a bad idea — while you pay more at the start, if you divide the cost by the months of service, it's significantly cheaper over time. Most of the deals we highlight below follow that pattern, so make sure you're comfortable with a longer commitment before you take the plunge. If you've been thinking about subscribing to a VPN service, read on for the best VPN deals we could find right now. Best VPN deals ExpressVPN Basic — $68.40 for a two-year subscription with four months free (81 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This Cyber Monday deal, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents an 81 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price. ExpressVPN Advanced — $88 for a two-year subscription with four months free (77 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. It's rare to see ExpressVPN doing anything for Cyber Monday, so give this deal some serious thought. As above, note that it renews at $119.95 annually. NordVPN Basic — $80.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (74 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. NordVPN includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This early Black Friday deal gives you 74 percent off the two-year plan, which also comes with three extra months. NordVPN Plus — $105.03 for a two-year subscription with three months free (74 percent off): In another early Black Friday discount, NordVPN has also taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. Surfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark. Surfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (88 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes. CyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with two months free (83 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 26 months of CyberGhost for 83 percent off the usual price. hide.me — $69.95 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. Private Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. What makes a good VPN deal Practically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like Black Friday/Cyber Monday. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers. One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

One trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.

          "standfirst": "Amazon’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales might be over, but the company is still running a deal on its premium music streaming service. Right now, you can get three months of Amazon Music Unlimited for free if you’re a new subscriber. As with most offers of this nature, your subscription will auto-renew for the full price of $12 per month (or $11 for Prime members) after your three months are up. But you can cancel whenever you like and won’t be charged a penny if you do so before the trial ends. Amazon Music Unlimited offers lossless streaming and podcasts, and as you’d expect, it works best with Amazon’s ever-swelling army of Alexa devices. It’s a bit clunky compared to the likes of Apple Music and Spotify, and not as good for music discovery and curation, but the app has made strides over the years. It even has its own Spotify Wrapped-alike now. If you do take advantage of this deal, bear in mind that Amazon Music Unlimited is more expensive than Apple Music, YouTube Music and Tidal without a Prime subscription, after Amazon put its prices up earlier this year. A paid Spotify Premium Individual plan costs the same as Amazon’s service (sans Prime), and you can also try that for free right now, with the company offering four months without payment provided you’ve never been a Premium subscriber in the past.

          "title": "Nikon ZR review: A highly capable cinema camera at a reasonable price",
          "standfirst": "Video used to be an afterthought for Nikon, but since the company purchased RED last year, content creators are now high on its priority list. A perfect example of that is Nikon’s new $2,200 ZR: a full-frame mirrorless model that stands up against dedicated cinema cameras for a fraction of the price. It’s the first consumer camera to capture video using RED’s 12-bit RAW format, but unlike RED’s Hollywood cameras, it has a fast and accurate autofocus system. It also comes with a huge display, pro video monitoring tools, in-body stabilization and 32-bit float internal audio recording. After shooting a short film that tested its capabilities, I can confirm that the Nikon ZR offers incredible video quality at this price. Body and handling While a bit lighter than Nikon’s Z6 III, the 1.19-pound (540-gram) ZR feels solid. It has a boxy design like Sony’s FX2 but a much smaller grip because it’s designed to be rigged up for cinema shooting with cages and handles. However, unlike the FX2 which has multiple 1/4-inch mounting threads to do such rigging, the ZR unfortunately has only one of those on the bottom. The ZR also lacks an electronic viewfinder like the FX2, but it more than makes up for that with its huge 4-inch display — the largest I’ve ever seen on a mirrorless camera. At 1,000 nits, it’s bright enough to shoot on sunny days, extremely sharp (3.07 million dots) and flips out for vloggers. All of that makes it a perfect primary display for checking the image and controlling the camera. Nikon has nailed the ZR’s handling, too. While it’s not covered with buttons and dials like some models, it does have two shooting dials to control exposure and a joystick for autofocus. There’s also a camera/video switch, two record buttons, a power switch and five customizable buttons. Many of Nikon’s lenses come with control rings as well, so extra manual control is available. The menu button is unusual: you press once for the quick menu and hold to see the full menu. Given the large number of settings, I would advise anyone buying this camera to learn all the important adjustments, then customize the controls to avoid wading through dense menus while shooting. Another unique feature is in the battery compartment. There’s a single fast CFexpress slot to handle RAW video, plus a microSD slot for proxies. The lack of a second CFexpress slot or fast SD card slot for backup isn’t ideal for a professional camera, though. Finally, the ZR runs on the same N‑EL15c batteries as other Nikon mirrorless cameras. They allow 90 minutes of HD shooting on a charge, or 390 photos per CIPA standards. That’s mediocre, so if you’re planning long shoots, stock up on batteries. Video Steve Dent for Engadget The Nikon ZR has the largest selection of RAW video settings I’ve seen. The centerpiece is RED’s RAW R3D NE light codec (designed by RED for Nikon) with RED’s Log3G10 log format. It also supports Nikon’s N-RAW, ProRes/ProRes RAW and H.265 with resolution that ranges from 6K at up to 60 fps to 4K 120 fps and 1080p at 240 fps. Despite the smallish body, it can capture 6K RAW video continuously for 125 minutes without overheating. The 24MP sensor uses a dual ISO system with native 800 and 6,400 ISOs, providing a nice range for indoor and outdoor shooting. The company claims 15+ stops of dynamic range, which is more than just about any other mirrorless camera. Other key video features include five-axis in-body stabilization with seven stops of shake reduction, waveform and vectorscope monitoring and a false color display for manual focus. To test the camera’s features and video quality, I shot a short film in a mix of indoor low light, outdoor daytime and a mix between the two. I also shot handheld (including running with it) to test the stabilization. I primarily captured in R3D RAW, as well as Nikon’s N-RAW at the native 800 and 6,400 ISOs to maximize dynamic range. (You can take 24MP photos with this camera, but I’m focusing on video as it’s mainly designed for that.) In order to not see a flat log profile when shooting, you’ll need to apply a look-up table (LUT) designed for RED cameras, like \"Achromic,\" \"Bleach\" or \"Caustic.\" Those are only for in-camera previews and not baked into the video, but you can apply those LUTs later in Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve to get the same look. Steve Dent for Engadget With such a high native ISO, I was able to shoot inside with a single studio light. Video quality was outstanding with little noise in shadow regions, even after boosting black levels in post. Meanwhile, the RED R3D codec and Log3G10 gave me extra latitude to reveal shadow detail and dial down highlights when I shot the subject against a bright window. When you use the R3D codec, exposure is strictly manual with no ability to set auto shutter speed (shutter angle) or f-stop. So, for a scene with varying light, I used Nikon’s N-RAW to see if it would give me the correct exposure at the beginning and end of the scene. It did a good job, with no noticeable jumps during the shot. Video in sunlight at ISO 800 was also sharp with accurate colors after downscaling to 4K from 6K in DaVinci Resolve. ISO 800 is a relatively high native setting, though, and the ZR doesn’t have a built-in ND filter to reduce exposure. That means you’ll need to buy ND filters for outside shooting or the high shutter speeds will result in choppy video. Cinema cameras from Blackmagic Design, Arri or RED are manual-focus only. But the ZR is a Nikon camera, and it has the best AF system I’ve seen on any of the company’s models, consistently nailing focus even with moving subjects. You can also automatically track vehicles, birds and other animals. At the same time, the ZR handles manual focus well. That’s thanks to a built-in display that’s big enough to check focus accurately and Nikon’s focus peaking setting with three levels of sensitivity. Steve Dent for Engadget In-body stabilization on the ZR wasn’t up to par with Panasonic’s S1 II, however. Video was smooth for handheld shooting if I panned the camera gently, but all my running and walking shots showed noticeable camera shake. That said, the ZR at least has in-body stabilization, unlike most cinema cameras, and most filmmakers will use a gimbal for running shots, regardless of which camera they use. (Note that the rattling you hear when the ZR is turned off is the sensor, which floats by design.) Finally, I was able to capture good audio quality via an external microphone without any clipping worries thanks to the Nikon ZR’s 32-bit float internal audio capture. The company also touts directional capture using its built-in mics, but as with any such system, audio quality isn’t high enough for production use. Wrap-up With the ZR, Nikon has shown that it’s finally catching up to and even surpassing its rivals for content creation. Whether you’re doing social media, YouTube, documentaries or even film production, this camera is versatile and powerful with few compromises. Video quality and ease of use even beats models that are double or triple the price. The ZR’s primary competition is in the low-end cinema cameras, particularly Sony’s $2,998 FX2 and the $3,899 Canon R5C. While more expensive, both come with an electronic viewfinder that the ZR lacks, and the R5C can shoot up to 8K video. Another option is Blackmagic Design’s Pyxis 6K camera, but it only offers basic autofocus capabilities and lacks in-body stabilization. Compared to those options, Nikon’s ZR delivers better dynamic range thanks to the inclusion of RED’s R3D RAW codec. It also comes with an excellent autofocus system and decent in-body stabilization. If you’re a creator looking to get the best video quality for the money without losing those niceties, I’d highly recommend the ZR.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/nikon-zr-review-a-highly-capable-cinema-camera-at-a-reasonable-price-152634311.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Video used to be an afterthought for Nikon, but since the company purchased RED last year, content creators are now high on its priority list. A perfect example of that is Nikon’s new $2,200 ZR: a full-frame mirrorless model that stands up against dedicated cinema cameras for a fraction of the price. It’s the first consumer camera to capture video using RED’s 12-bit RAW format, but unlike RED’s Hollywood cameras, it has a fast and accurate autofocus system. It also comes with a huge display, pro video monitoring tools, in-body stabilization and 32-bit float internal audio recording. After shooting a short film that tested its capabilities, I can confirm that the Nikon ZR offers incredible video quality at this price. Body and handling While a bit lighter than Nikon’s Z6 III, the 1.19-pound (540-gram) ZR feels solid. It has a boxy design like Sony’s FX2 but a much smaller grip because it’s designed to be rigged up for cinema shooting with cages and handles. However, unlike the FX2 which has multiple 1/4-inch mounting threads to do such rigging, the ZR unfortunately has only one of those on the bottom. The ZR also lacks an electronic viewfinder like the FX2, but it more than makes up for that with its huge 4-inch display — the largest I’ve ever seen on a mirrorless camera. At 1,000 nits, it’s bright enough to shoot on sunny days, extremely sharp (3.07 million dots) and flips out for vloggers. All of that makes it a perfect primary display for checking the image and controlling the camera. Nikon has nailed the ZR’s handling, too. While it’s not covered with buttons and dials like some models, it does have two shooting dials to control exposure and a joystick for autofocus. There’s also a camera/video switch, two record buttons, a power switch and five customizable buttons. Many of Nikon’s lenses come with control rings as well, so extra manual control is available. The menu button is unusual: you press once for the quick menu and hold to see the full menu. Given the large number of settings, I would advise anyone buying this camera to learn all the important adjustments, then customize the controls to avoid wading through dense menus while shooting. Another unique feature is in the battery compartment. There’s a single fast CFexpress slot to handle RAW video, plus a microSD slot for proxies. The lack of a second CFexpress slot or fast SD card slot for backup isn’t ideal for a professional camera, though. Finally, the ZR runs on the same N‑EL15c batteries as other Nikon mirrorless cameras. They allow 90 minutes of HD shooting on a charge, or 390 photos per CIPA standards.

          "standfirst": "Presented by CelonisWhen tariff rates change overnight, companies have 48 hours to model alternatives and act before competitors secure the best options. At Celosphere 2025 in Munich, enterprises demonstrated how they’re turning that chaos into competitive advantage — with quantifiable results that separate winners from losers.Vinmar International: Theglobal plastics and chemicals distributor created a real-time digital twin of its $3B supply chain, cutting default expedites by more than 20% and improving delivery agility across global operations.Florida Crystals: One of America&#x27;s largest cane sugar producers, the company unlocked millions in working capital and strengthened supply chain resilience by eliminating manual rework across Finance, Procurement, and Inbound Supply. AI pilots now extend gains into invoice processing, predictive maintenance, and order management.ASOS: The ecommerce fashion giant connected its end-to-end supply chain for full transparency, reducing process variation, accelerating speed-to-market, and improving customer experience at scale. The common thread here: process intelligence that bridges the gap traditional ERP systems can’t close — connecting operational dots across ERP, finance, and logistics systems when seconds matter. “The question isn’t whether disruptions will hit,” says Peter Budweiser, General Manager of Supply Chain at Celonis. “It’s whether your systems can show you what’s breaking fast enough to fix it.”That visibility gap costs the average company double-digit millions in working capital and competitive positioning. As 54% of supply chain leaders face disruptions daily, the pressure is shifting to AI agents that execute real actions: triggering purchase orders, rerouting shipments, adjusting inventory. But an autonomous agent acting on stale or siloed data can make million-dollar mistakes when tariff structures shift overnight. Tariffs, as old as trade itself, have become the ultimate stress test for enterprise AI — revealing whether companies truly understand their supply chains and whether their AI can be trusted to act.Modern ERP: Data rich, insight poorSupply chain leaders face a paradox: drowning in data while starving for insight. Traditional enterprise systems — SAP, Oracle, PeopleSoft — capture every transaction meticulously. SAP logs the purchase order. Oracle tracks the shipment. The warehouse system records inventory movement. Each performs its function, but when tariffs change and companies need to model alternative sourcing scenarios across all three simultaneously, the data sits in silos.“What’s changed is the speed at which disruptions cascade,” says Manik Sharma, Head of Supply Chain GTM AI at Celonis. “Traditional ERP systems weren’t built for today’s volatility.”Companies generate thousands of reports showing what happened last quarter. They struggle to answer what happens if tariffs increase 25% tomorrow and need to switch suppliers within days.Tariffs: The 48-hour scrambleGlobal trade volatility has transformed tariffs from predictable costs into strategic weapons. When new rates drop with unprecedented frequency, input costs spike across suppliers, finance teams scramble to calculate margin impact, and procurement races to identify alternatives buried in disconnected systems where no one knows if switching suppliers delays shipments or violates contracts.By hour 48, competitors who already modeled scenarios execute supplier switches while late movers face capacity constraints and premium pricing. Process intelligence changes that dynamic by allowing businesses to continuously model “what-if” scenarios, showing leaders how tariff changes cascade through suppliers, contracts, production lines, warehouses, and customers. When rates hit, companies can move within hours instead of days.No AI without PI: Why process intelligence is non-negotiable for supply chainsAI and supply chains are mutually dependent: AI needs operational context, and supply chains need AI to keep pace with volatility. But here&#x27;s the truth — there is no AI without PI. Without process intelligence, AI agents operate blindly.The ongoing SAP migration wave illustrates why. An estimated 85–90% of SAP customers are still moving from ECC to S/4HANA. Moving to newer databases doesn’t solve supply chain visibility — it provides faster access to the same fragmented data.Kerry Brown, a transformation evangelist at Celonis, sees this across industries. “Organizations are shifting from PeopleSoft to Oracle, or EBS to Fusion. The bulk is in SAP,” she explains. “But what they really need isn’t a new ERP. They need to understand how work actually flows across systems they already have.”That requires end-to-end operational context. Process intelligence provides this by enabling companies to extract and connect event data across systems, showing how processes execute in real time.This distinction becomes critical when deploying autonomous agents. When visibility is fragmented, autonomous agents can easily make decisions that appear rational locally but create downstream disruption. With real-time context, AI can operate with clarity and precision, and supply chains can stay ahead of tariff-driven disruption.Digital Twins: Powering real-time responseThe companies highlighted at Celosphere all applied the same principle: understand how processes run across systems in real time. Celonis PI creates a digital twin above existing systems, using its Process Intelligence Graph to link orders, shipments, invoices, and payments end-to-end. Dependencies that traditional integrations miss become visible. A delay in SAP instantly reveals its impact across Oracle, warehouse scheduling, and customer delivery commitments.“The platform brings together process data spanning systems and departments, enriched with business context that powers AI agents to transform operations effectively,” says Daniel Brown, Chief Product Officer at Celonis. With this cross-system awareness, Celonis coordinates actions across complex workflows involving AI agents, humans, and automations — especially critical when tariffs force rapid decisions about suppliers, shipments, and customers.Zero-copy integration enables instant modelingA key advancement unveiled at Celosphere — zero-copy integration with Databricks — removes another barrier. Traditionally, analyzing supply chain data meant copying from source systems into central warehouses, creating data latency.Celonis Data Core now integrates directly with platforms like Databricks and Microsoft Fabric, querying billions of records in near real time without duplication. When trade policy shifts, companies model alternatives instantly, not after overnight data refresh cycles.Enhanced Task Mining extends this by connecting desktop activity — keystrokes, mouse clicks, screen scrolls — to business processes. This exposes manual work invisible to system logs: spreadsheet gymnastics, email negotiations, phone calls that keep supply chains moving during urgent changes.Competitive advantage in volatile marketsMost companies can’t rip out and replace systems running critical operations — nor should they. Process intelligence offers a different path: compose workflows from existing systems, deploy AI where it creates value, and adapt continuously as conditions change. This “Free the Process” movement liberates companies from rigid architectures without forcing wholesale replacement.As global trade volatility intensifies, the companies that model will move faster, make smarter decisions, and turn tariff chaos into competitive advantage — all while existing ERPs keep running.When the next wave of tariffs hits — and it will — companies won’t have days to respond. They’ll have hours. The question isn’t whether your ERP captures the data. It’s whether your systems connect the dots fast enough to matter.Missed Celosphere 2025?

          "title": "Missing NBC on Fubo? Here's how to watch this week's NBA games and more",
          "standfirst": "If you're a Fubo subscriber, you've certainly noticed that NBC and all NBCUniversal-owned channels have gone dark on the platform. For over a week, customers have gone without NBC programming like the Today Show, The Voice, and Sunday Night Football. Now, customers will have to find alternate methods of watching this week's NBA coverage on NBC, too. It's all because Fubo and NBCUniversal are having a contract dispute, so channels like NBC, USA Network, Telemundo, and Bravo have been unavailable on Fubo since Nov. 21, and as of now, there's no projected date for their return. A message released by Fubo to their customers explains, \"Fubo believes customers should have the option to choose among multiple distributors to access the content they love. Unfortunately, NBCU has offered terms regarding pricing and packaging that are egregiously above those offered to other distributors.\" A statement from an NBCU spokesperson adds, \"Fubo has chosen to drop NBCUniversal programming despite being offered the same terms agreed to by hundreds of other distributors. Unfortunately, this is par for the course for Fubo — they’ve dropped numerous networks in recent years at the expense of their customers, who continue to lose content.” (Fubo, for instance, cut Warner-owned channels back in 2024.) You can read more about exactly why Fubo is countering NBC's proposed deal here. While the companies are continuing discussions to come to an agreement, there is still no resolution. Fubo has already begun emailing customers to note that a $15 credit will be applied to their bills starting \"on or after December 1.\" But in the meantime, if you're a Fubo customer and are wondering how to watch this week's biggest games and shows, here's everything you need to know about the Fubo-NBC blackout, which channels are missing and your options for where to watch them. How to watch the NBA without Fubo This week's nationally televised NBA on NBC matchup between the Knicks vs. Celtics is on Tuesday, Dec. 2. As an alternative, you can tune in on platforms like Peacock, DirecTV, and Hulu + Live TV. Additionally, there are several games that are available on NBC in local markets that are available on platforms like DirecTV and Hulu + Live TV. What else is on NBC this week? In addition to this week's NBA games, there are loads of sports on NBC, USA, Universo and more that you won't want to miss, including extensive Premiere League coverage and NHL games, plus dozens of new show premieres this week like the Christmas in Rockefeller Center tree-lighting special, Stumble, and Happy's Place. On Bravo, there are new episodes of The Real Housewives of Potomac and The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, Southern Charm, and the season premiere of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, on Dec. 5, too. Which channels are no longer available on Fubo? The following is a list of channels owned or operated by NBC that are not currently available on Fubo: Local Channels: NBC Local Affiliates Telemundo Local/National Regional Sports Channels: NBC Sports 4K NBC Sports Bay Area NBC Sports Bay Area Plus NBC Sports Boston NBC Sports California NBC Sports California Plus NBC Sports California Plus 3 NBC Sports Philadelphia NBC Sports Philadelphia Plus National Channels: American Crimes Bravo Bravo Vault Caso Cerrado CNBC CNBC World Cozi Dateline 24/7 E! Entertainment Television E! Keeping Up Golf Channel GolfPass LX Home Million Dollar Listing Vault MS NOW (formerly MSNBC) NBC NOW NBC Sports NOW NBC Universo True CRMZ New England Cable News Noticias Telemundo Ahora Oxygen True Crime Oxygen True Crime Archives Real Housewives Vault SNL Vault Syfy Telemundo Accion Telemundo al Dia The Golf Channel Today All Day Universal Movies USA Network Why are these NBC-owned channels currently unavailable? Per Fubo, NBC channels were pulled from the platform because of a disagreement over their long-standing content distribution agreement that has yet to be resolved. When will the missing channels return? There is no information available as to when NBC's lineup of channels will return. Negotiations between the companies are ongoing. Is Fubo offering a rebate while these channels are missing? In a message to subscribers, Fubo stated, \"If NBCU programming remains off of Fubo for an extended period, we will directly credit $15 to your Fubo account.\" At least one Fubo customer on our staff received an email confirming the credit would be automatically applied in the December billing cycle. What alternatives do viewers have in the meantime? Looking to switch from Fubo? You've got plenty of options, including Peacock, DirecTV, and Hulu + Live TV. Here are some of your choices: Watch NBC on Peacock Get a deal on Peacock with Walmart+ Try DirecTV free for 5 days, and get $30 off your first month Try Hulu + Live TV for free Other services to watch NBC If I switch to a different service, can I cancel or pause Fubo in the meantime? Fubo does not allow customers to pause their subscriptions, so if you're looking to make a change, you can cancel your plan outright.

          "content": "If you're a Fubo subscriber, you've certainly noticed that NBC and all NBCUniversal-owned channels have gone dark on the platform. For over a week, customers have gone without NBC programming like the Today Show, The Voice, and Sunday Night Football. Now, customers will have to find alternate methods of watching this week's NBA coverage on NBC, too. It's all because Fubo and NBCUniversal are having a contract dispute, so channels like NBC, USA Network, Telemundo, and Bravo have been unavailable on Fubo since Nov. 21, and as of now, there's no projected date for their return. A message released by Fubo to their customers explains, \"Fubo believes customers should have the option to choose among multiple distributors to access the content they love. Unfortunately, NBCU has offered terms regarding pricing and packaging that are egregiously above those offered to other distributors.\" A statement from an NBCU spokesperson adds, \"Fubo has chosen to drop NBCUniversal programming despite being offered the same terms agreed to by hundreds of other distributors. Unfortunately, this is par for the course for Fubo — they’ve dropped numerous networks in recent years at the expense of their customers, who continue to lose content.” (Fubo, for instance, cut Warner-owned channels back in 2024.) You can read more about exactly why Fubo is countering NBC's proposed deal here. While the companies are continuing discussions to come to an agreement, there is still no resolution. Fubo has already begun emailing customers to note that a $15 credit will be applied to their bills starting \"on or after December 1.\" But in the meantime, if you're a Fubo customer and are wondering how to watch this week's biggest games and shows, here's everything you need to know about the Fubo-NBC blackout, which channels are missing and your options for where to watch them. How to watch the NBA without Fubo This week's nationally televised NBA on NBC matchup between the Knicks vs. Celtics is on Tuesday, Dec. 2. As an alternative, you can tune in on platforms like Peacock, DirecTV, and Hulu + Live TV. Additionally, there are several games that are available on NBC in local markets that are available on platforms like DirecTV and Hulu + Live TV. What else is on NBC this week? In addition to this week's NBA games, there are loads of sports on NBC, USA, Universo and more that you won't want to miss, including extensive Premiere League coverage and NHL games, plus dozens of new show premieres this week like the Christmas in Rockefeller Center tree-lighting special, Stumble, and Happy's Place. On Bravo, there are new episodes of The Real Housewives of Potomac and The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, Southern Charm, and the season premiere of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, on Dec. 5, too. Which channels are no longer available on Fubo? The following is a list of channels owned or operated by NBC that are not currently available on Fubo: Local Channels: NBC Local Affiliates Telemundo Local/National Regional Sports Channels: NBC Sports 4K NBC Sports Bay Area NBC Sports Bay Area Plus NBC Sports Boston NBC Sports California NBC Sports California Plus NBC Sports California Plus 3 NBC Sports Philadelphia NBC Sports Philadelphia Plus National Channels: American Crimes Bravo Bravo Vault Caso Cerrado CNBC CNBC World Cozi Dateline 24/7 E!

Per Fubo, NBC channels were pulled from the platform because of a disagreement over their long-standing content distribution agreement that has yet to be resolved. When will the missing channels return? There is no information available as to when NBC's lineup of channels will return. Negotiations between the companies are ongoing. Is Fubo offering a rebate while these channels are missing? In a message to subscribers, Fubo stated, \"If NBCU programming remains off of Fubo for an extended period, we will directly credit $15 to your Fubo account.\" At least one Fubo customer on our staff received an email confirming the credit would be automatically applied in the December billing cycle.

In 2023, he became the cofounder and CEO of ARMR Sciences to develop a vaccine against fentanyl. Now, the company is launching a trial to test its vaccine in people for the first time. The goal: prevent deaths from overdose. “It became very apparent to me that as I assessed the treatment landscape, everything that exists is reactionary,” Gage says. “I thought, why are we not preventing this?”Read full article Comments",

He now faces a maximum sentence of up to 70 years in prison that could be coupled with “a fine of up to $3.5 million,” the DOJ said. The podcaster—who primarily posted about “his desire to find a wife and his interactions with women”—allegedly harassed and sometimes even doxxed his victims through his videos on platforms including Instagram, Spotify, and TikTok. Over time, his videos and podcasts documented his intense desire to start a family, which was frustrated by his “anger towards women,” whom he claimed were “all the same from fucking 18 to fucking 40 to fucking 90” and “trash.”Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Thirty years ago today, Netscape Communications and Sun Microsystems issued a joint press release announcing JavaScript, an object scripting language designed for creating interactive web applications. The language emerged from a frantic 10-day sprint at pioneering browser company Netscape, where engineer Brendan Eich hacked together a working internal prototype during May of 1995. While the JavaScript language didn’t ship publicly until that September and didn’t reach a 1.0 release until March 1996, the descendants of Eich’s initial 10-day hack now run on approximately 98.9 percent of all websites with client-side code, making JavaScript the dominant programming language of the web. It’s wildly popular; beyond the browser, JavaScript powers server backends, mobile apps, desktop software, and even some embedded systems. According to several surveys, JavaScript consistently ranks among the most widely used programming languages in the world. In crafting JavaScript, Netscape wanted a scripting language that could make webpages interactive, something lightweight that would appeal to web designers and non-professional programmers. Eich drew from several influences: The syntax looked like a trendy new programming language called Java to satisfy Netscape management, but its guts borrowed concepts from Scheme, a language Eich admired, and Self, which contributed JavaScript’s prototype-based object model.Read full article Comments",

Cao’s team didn’t go for a robot—instead, it adapted a female mosquito proboscis to work as a nozzle in a super-precise 3D printer. And it worked surprisingly well. Fangs and stings To find the right nozzle for their 3D necroprinting system, Cao’s team began with a broad survey of natural micro-dispensing tips. The researchers examined stingers of bees, wasps, and scorpions; the fangs of venomous snakes; and the claws of centipedes. All of those evolved to deliver a fluid to the target, which is roughly what a 3D printer’s nozzle does. But they all had issues. “Some were too curved and curved for high-precision 3D printing,” Cao explained. “Also, they were optimized for delivering pulses of venom, not for a steady, continuous flow, which is what you need for printing.”Read full article Comments",

Experts envision a future of secure, personal AI tools with on-device intelligence, but does that match the reality of the AI boom? AI on the “edge” sounds great, but almost every AI tool of consequence is running in the cloud. So what’s that chip in your phone even doing? What is an NPU?

Lego’s NASA Artemis Space Launch System Rocket, part of its Technic line of advanced building sets, will land on store shelves for $60 on January 1, 2026, and then “blast off” from kitchen tables, office desks and living room floors. The 632-piece set climbs skyward, separating from its expendable stages along the way, until the Orion crew spacecraft and its European Service Module top out the motion on their way to the moon—or wherever your imagination carries it. “The educational LEGO Technic set shows the moment a rocket launches, in three distinct stages,” reads the product description on Lego’s website. “Turn the crank to see the solid rocket boosters separate from the core stage, which then also detaches. Continue turning to watch the upper stage with its engine module, Orion spacecraft and launch abort system separate.”Read full article Comments",

The vulnerability is easy to exploit and allows hackers to execute malicious code on servers that run it. Exploit code is now publicly available. React is embedded into web apps running on servers so that remote devices render JavaScript and content more quickly and with fewer resources required. React is used by an estimated 6 percent of all websites and 39 percent of cloud environments. When end users reload a page, React allows servers to re-render only parts that have changed, a feature that drastically speeds up performance and lowers the computing resources required by the server.Read full article Comments",

Without evidence, Prasad claimed COVID-19 vaccines have killed 10 children in the US, and, as such, he announced unilateral, sweeping changes to the way the agency regulates and approves vaccines, including seasonal flu shots. On Wednesday evening, a dozen former FDA commissioners, who collectively oversaw the agency for more than 35 years, responded to the memo with a scathing rebuke. Uniting to publish their response in the New England Journal of Medicine, the former commissioners said they were “deeply concerned” by Prasad’s memo, which they framed as a “threat” to the FDA’s work and a danger to Americans’ health. In his memo, Prasad called for abandoning the FDA’s current framework for updating seasonal flu shots and other vaccines, such as those for COVID-19. Those updates currently involve studies that measure well-characterized immune responses (called immunobridging studies). Prasad dismissed this approach as insufficient and, instead, plans to require expensive randomized trials, which can take months to years for each vaccine update.Read full article Comments",

The new BMW iX3 is an important car for the automaker. It’s the first of a new series of vehicles that BMW is calling the Neue Klasse, calling back to a range of cars that helped define the brand in the 1960s. Then, as now, propulsion is provided by the best powertrain BMW’s engineers could design and build, wrapped in styling that heralds the company’s new look. Except now, that powertrain is fully electric, and the cabin features technology that would have been scarcely believable to the driver of a new 1962 BMW 1500. In fact, the iX3 is only half the story when it comes to BMW’s neue look for the Neue Klasse—there’s an all-electric 3 series sedan on the way, too. The sedan will surely appeal to enthusiasts, particularly the version that the M tuning arm has worked its magic upon, but you’ll have to wait until early 2026 to read about that stuff. Which makes sense: crossovers and SUVs—or “sports activity vehicles” in BMW-speak—are what the market wants these days, so that’s what comes first. The technical stuff As we learned earlier this summer, BMW leaned heavily into sustainability when it designed the iX3. There’s extensive use of recycled battery minerals, interior plastics, and aluminum, and the automaker has gone for a monomaterial approach where possible to make recycling the car a lot easier. There’s also an all-new EV powertrain, BMW’s sixth-generation. When it goes on sale here next summer, the launch model will be the iX3 50 xDrive, which pairs an asynchronous motor at the front axle and an electrically excited synchronous motor at the rear for a combined output of 463 hp (345 kW) and 475 lb-ft (645 Nm).Read full article Comments",

Other Republicans opposed including the AI preemption in the defense bill, The Hill reported, joining critics who see value in allowing states to quickly regulate AI risks as they arise. For months, Trump has pressured the Republican-led Congress to block state AI laws that the president claims could bog down innovation as AI firms waste time and resources complying with a patchwork of state laws. But Republicans have continually failed to unite behind Trump’s command, first voting against including a similar measure in the “Big Beautiful” budget bill and then this week failing to negotiate a solution to pass the NDAA measure.Read full article Comments",

The adjustment is reportedly unusual for Microsoft, and it comes after the company missed a number of ambitious sales goals for its AI offerings. AI agents are specialized implementations of AI language models designed to perform multistep tasks autonomously rather than simply responding to single prompts. So-called “agentic” features have been central to Microsoft’s 2025 sales pitch: At its Build conference in May, the company declared that it has entered “the era of AI agents.” The company has promised customers that agents could automate complex tasks, such as generating dashboards from sales data or writing customer reports. At its Ignite conference in November, Microsoft announced new features like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot, along with tools for building and deploying agents through Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio.

It’s the sequel to this year’s critically acclaimed 28 Years Later, the third film in a franchise credited with sparking the 21st-century revival of the zombie genre. (Some spoilers for the first three films below.) As previously reported, in 28 Days Later, a highly contagious “Rage Virus” was accidentally released from a lab in Cambridge, England. Those infected turned into violent, mindless monsters who brutally attacked the uninfected—so-called “fast zombies”—and the virus spread rapidly, effectively collapsing society. The sequel, 28 Weeks Later, featured a new cast of characters living on the outskirts of London. But all it takes is one careless person getting infected for the virus to spread uncontrollably again. So naturally, that’s what happened.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "The fossil and genetic evidence agree that modern humans originated in Africa. The most genetically diverse human populations—the groups that have had the longest time to pick up novel mutations—live there today. But the history of what went on within Africa between our origins and the present day is a bit murky. That’s partly because DNA doesn’t survive long in the conditions typical of most of the continent, which has largely limited us to trying to reconstruct the past using data from present-day populations. The other part is that many of those present-day populations have been impacted by the vast genetic churn caused by the Bantu expansion, which left its traces across most of the populations south of the Sahara. But a new study has managed to extract genomes from ancient samples in southern Africa. While all of these are relatively recent, dating from after the end of the most recent glacial period, they reveal a distinct southern African population that was relatively large, outside of the range of previously described human variation, and it remained isolated until only about 1,000 years ago.Read full article Comments",

The company cited heavy demand from AI data centers as the reason for abandoning its consumer brand, a move that will remove one of the most recognizable names in the do-it-yourself PC upgrade market. “The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage,” Sumit Sadana, EVP and chief business officer at Micron Technology, said in a statement. “Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments.” Micron said it will continue shipping Crucial consumer products through the end of its fiscal second quarter in February 2026 and will honor warranties on existing products. The company will continue selling Micron-branded enterprise products to commercial customers and plans to redeploy affected employees to other positions within the company.Read full article Comments",

Gas and electric utility Eversource Energy completed the first phase of its geothermal network in Framingham, Massachusetts, in 2024. Eversource is a co-recipient of the award along with the city of Framingham and HEET, a Boston-based nonprofit that focuses on geothermal energy and is the lead recipient of the funding. Geothermal networks are widely considered among the most energy-efficient ways to heat and cool buildings. The federal money will allow Eversource to add approximately 140 new customers to the Framingham network and fund research to monitor the system’s performance.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "A sprawling infrastructure that has been bilking unsuspecting people through fraudulent gambling websites for 14 years is likely a dual operation run by a nation-state-sponsored group that is targeting government and private-industry organizations in the US and Europe, researchers said Wednesday. Researchers have previously tracked smaller pieces of the enormous infrastructure. Last month, security firm Sucuri reported that the operation seeks out and compromises poorly configured websites running the WordPress CMS. Imperva in January said the attackers also scan for and exploit web apps built with the PHP programming language that have existing webshells or vulnerabilities. Once the weaknesses are exploited, the attackers install a GSocket, a backdoor that the attackers use to compromise servers and host gambling web content on them. All of the gambling sites target Indonesian-speaking visitors. Because Indonesian law prohibits gambling, many people in that country are drawn to illicit services. Most of the 236,433 attacker-owned domains hosting the gambling sites are hosted on Cloudflare. Most of the 1,481 hijacked subdomains were hosted on Amazon Web Services, Azure, and GitHub.Read full article Comments",
