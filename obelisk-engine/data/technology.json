          "standfirst": "Black Friday is done, but the sales still roll on, and Cyber Monday remains a decent chance to pick up any storage gear you’ve been eyeing. If you have a PC, PS5, gaming handheld or any other gadget that could use some extra space, we’re weeding out the junk and rounding up the best Cyber Monday SSD deals and other storage discounts you can still get right now. It's not the most plentiful time for SSD deals more generally, but we're still seeing a handful of discounts on well-reviewed internal drives, portable SSDs and microSD cards. We'll update this post as we find more offers that are worth your time. Best Cyber Monday microSD card deals Samsung P9 Express microSD Express Card (512GB) for $75 at Amazon ($25 off MSRP): If you need even more room for your Switch 2, this is a new low for the 512GB version of Samsung’s newest microSD Express card. Full disclosure: Samsung launched this card a couple of weeks ago, and we only just got it in for testing. But given the trend of similar Switch 2 performance we’ve seen with other Express cards thus far, and the fact that this is easily the cheapest 512GB model we can find in stock as of this writing, we figure it’s worth noting. Also at Samsung. Lexar Play Pro (1TB) microSD Express card for $186 at Amazon ($34 off): If you want the most space possible for Nintendo's new console, the Play Pro is one of the few microSD Express cards available in a 1TB capacity. This is the second-best price we've seen for that card since July, so it's not an amazing deal, but it is the cheapest 1TB model we can find from a reliable brand right now. Samsung Pro Plus (1TB, 2-pack) for $136 at Best Buy ($104 off): The Pro Plus is the runner-up pick in our guide to the best microSD cards. On its own, it’s not worth buying over the faster Lexar Professional Silver Plus when both are available for the same price — which is the case right now — but this bundle deal that packages two 1TB cards together for $68 apiece is much more appealing if you need space for multiple devices. Just add two to your cart or click the “special offers” link on Best Buy’s product page to see the discount at checkout. If you need another card, you can also grab a three-pack for $204. For reference, the previous low for an individual 1TB Pro Plus card is $70. SanDisk microSD Express Card (256GB) for $60 at Amazon ($8 off): Like the offers above, this discount matches the best price we’ve seen for SanDisk’s 256GB microSD Express card. There isn’t much point in grabbing it as long as cheaper options are in stock, though this is technically the fastest all-around model we’ve tested when it comes to transferring games to and from the Switch 2’s built-in storage. (Within games, however, the difference is still minimal.) We’ll note it here just in case the other Express models completely sell out. Also at B&H. Best Cyber Monday internal SSD deals SK Hynix Platinum P51 (1TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $110 at Newegg ($60 off): Most people don’t have to pay extra for the top-tier performance of a PCIe 5.0 SSD like the Platinum P51, but if you need something for more intense workloads or just want the comfort of owning a more futureproof SSD, reviews around the web suggest this is one of the better options available. Just make sure you have a compatible motherboard and CPU first. This offer ties the lowest price yet for the 1TB model. Use the code BFEFE96 to get the full discount at checkout. Crucial T705 (2TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD with heatsink for $170 at B&H ($150 off, in and out of stock): If you need a bit more room from a PCIe 5.0 drive, the Crucial T705 is a slightly older but still highly rated alternative with blazing-fast speeds. This is the best price we've tracked for the 2TB model with a heatsink, which isn't 100 percent essential for everyone but helps minimize thermal throttling all the same. Samsung SSD 9100 Pro (8TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD with heatsink for $750 at B&H ($270 off): Yes, we realize this is a ton to spend on a new SSD, but if you’re in the niche that wants a PCIe 5.0 drive with as much capacity as possible, it ties the lowest price we’ve tracked for the 8TB variant of Samsung’s top-end model. Most reviews say that the 9100 Pro is outpaced by the WD Black SN8100 at the enthusiast end of the market, but it’s still competitive, and the 8TB version of that WD drive is priced $250 higher as of this writing. Most other direct rivals, meanwhile, aren’t yet available with this much space. Crucial P310 (2TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $130 at B&H ($111 off, in and out of stock): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can slot in certain thin and light notebooks or gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but most reviews say it performs well for what it is. This discount is a few bucks above the largest drop to date for the 2TB model, but it’s still about $20 off the drive’s usual street price. Best Cyber Monday portable SSD deals Crucial X10 Pro (4TB) portable SSD for $210 at B&H ($60 off): The X10 Pro is a older and slightly slower version of the X10 — confusing, we know — but it comes with a metal enclosure, a five-year warranty (instead of three) and 256-bit hardware encryption. The X9 Pro and standard X10 are better values when they’re cheaper, but that’s not the case right now if you want a 4TB drive. This deal matches an all-time low. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($60 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to an Xbox Series X or Series S is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only two of those exist, and they’re both expensive compared to traditional SSDs. Still, they’re dead simple to set up, and this Seagate model holds up well compared to the consoles’ internal storage. This deal on the 2TB model is $15 higher than the all-time low we saw over the weekend, but it's still about $20 off the card's usual going rate in recent months. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. The 4TB variant is also discounted at $380 — that’s a ton to spend on one of these things, but it does match the lowest price we’ve tracked for that particular model.

          "content": "Black Friday is done, but the sales still roll on, and Cyber Monday remains a decent chance to pick up any storage gear you’ve been eyeing. If you have a PC, PS5, gaming handheld or any other gadget that could use some extra space, we’re weeding out the junk and rounding up the best Cyber Monday SSD deals and other storage discounts you can still get right now. It's not the most plentiful time for SSD deals more generally, but we're still seeing a handful of discounts on well-reviewed internal drives, portable SSDs and microSD cards. We'll update this post as we find more offers that are worth your time. Best Cyber Monday microSD card deals Samsung P9 Express microSD Express Card (512GB) for $75 at Amazon ($25 off MSRP): If you need even more room for your Switch 2, this is a new low for the 512GB version of Samsung’s newest microSD Express card. Full disclosure: Samsung launched this card a couple of weeks ago, and we only just got it in for testing. But given the trend of similar Switch 2 performance we’ve seen with other Express cards thus far, and the fact that this is easily the cheapest 512GB model we can find in stock as of this writing, we figure it’s worth noting. Also at Samsung. Lexar Play Pro (1TB) microSD Express card for $186 at Amazon ($34 off): If you want the most space possible for Nintendo's new console, the Play Pro is one of the few microSD Express cards available in a 1TB capacity. This is the second-best price we've seen for that card since July, so it's not an amazing deal, but it is the cheapest 1TB model we can find from a reliable brand right now. Samsung Pro Plus (1TB, 2-pack) for $136 at Best Buy ($104 off): The Pro Plus is the runner-up pick in our guide to the best microSD cards. On its own, it’s not worth buying over the faster Lexar Professional Silver Plus when both are available for the same price — which is the case right now — but this bundle deal that packages two 1TB cards together for $68 apiece is much more appealing if you need space for multiple devices. Just add two to your cart or click the “special offers” link on Best Buy’s product page to see the discount at checkout. If you need another card, you can also grab a three-pack for $204. For reference, the previous low for an individual 1TB Pro Plus card is $70. SanDisk microSD Express Card (256GB) for $60 at Amazon ($8 off): Like the offers above, this discount matches the best price we’ve seen for SanDisk’s 256GB microSD Express card. There isn’t much point in grabbing it as long as cheaper options are in stock, though this is technically the fastest all-around model we’ve tested when it comes to transferring games to and from the Switch 2’s built-in storage. (Within games, however, the difference is still minimal.) We’ll note it here just in case the other Express models completely sell out. Also at B&H. Best Cyber Monday internal SSD deals SK Hynix Platinum P51 (1TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $110 at Newegg ($60 off): Most people don’t have to pay extra for the top-tier performance of a PCIe 5.0 SSD like the Platinum P51, but if you need something for more intense workloads or just want the comfort of owning a more futureproof SSD, reviews around the web suggest this is one of the better options available. Just make sure you have a compatible motherboard and CPU first. This offer ties the lowest price yet for the 1TB model. Use the code BFEFE96 to get the full discount at checkout. Crucial T705 (2TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD with heatsink for $170 at B&H ($150 off, in and out of stock): If you need a bit more room from a PCIe 5.0 drive, the Crucial T705 is a slightly older but still highly rated alternative with blazing-fast speeds. This is the best price we've tracked for the 2TB model with a heatsink, which isn't 100 percent essential for everyone but helps minimize thermal throttling all the same. Samsung SSD 9100 Pro (8TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD with heatsink for $750 at B&H ($270 off): Yes, we realize this is a ton to spend on a new SSD, but if you’re in the niche that wants a PCIe 5.0 drive with as much capacity as possible, it ties the lowest price we’ve tracked for the 8TB variant of Samsung’s top-end model. Most reviews say that the 9100 Pro is outpaced by the WD Black SN8100 at the enthusiast end of the market, but it’s still competitive, and the 8TB version of that WD drive is priced $250 higher as of this writing. Most other direct rivals, meanwhile, aren’t yet available with this much space. Crucial P310 (2TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $130 at B&H ($111 off, in and out of stock): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can slot in certain thin and light notebooks or gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but most reviews say it performs well for what it is. This discount is a few bucks above the largest drop to date for the 2TB model, but it’s still about $20 off the drive’s usual street price. Best Cyber Monday portable SSD deals Crucial X10 Pro (4TB) portable SSD for $210 at B&H ($60 off): The X10 Pro is a older and slightly slower version of the X10 — confusing, we know — but it comes with a metal enclosure, a five-year warranty (instead of three) and 256-bit hardware encryption. The X9 Pro and standard X10 are better values when they’re cheaper, but that’s not the case right now if you want a 4TB drive. This deal matches an all-time low. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($60 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to an Xbox Series X or Series S is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only two of those exist, and they’re both expensive compared to traditional SSDs. Still, they’re dead simple to set up, and this Seagate model holds up well compared to the consoles’ internal storage. This deal on the 2TB model is $15 higher than the all-time low we saw over the weekend, but it's still about $20 off the card's usual going rate in recent months. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.

          "title": "HBO Max Cyber Monday deal: Get one year of access for only $3 per month",
          "standfirst": "HBO Max has a limited-time, one-year subscription deal, offering a chance to stream HBO originals and Warner Bros. blockbusters at a lower cost. The platform has reduced pricing to $3 per month for one year, bringing the final cost down to $36 for the year. With many streaming services increasing their rates, this short-term offer lets you catch up on hit shows and new releases without committing to a full year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. The deal runs through the end of the day December 1. HBO Max has one of the best libraries of content in the streaming market, combining HBO’s acclaimed originals with Warner Bros. theatrical releases, Discovery content and live sports. The service now runs across three main plans. The Basic With Ads plan, the one included in this deal, allows streaming on two devices in full HD and costs $11 a month at full price. The Standard plan adds offline downloads, more live sports coverage and better device flexibility for $18.49 per month. The Premium plan increases quality to 4K with Dolby Atmos sound (where available), four simultaneous streams and up to 100 downloadable titles for $23 monthly. While the feature differences matter, the real appeal of HBO Max is its library. Subscribers get access to the full catalog of HBO originals, including House of the Dragon, The White Lotus, The Last of Us and Euphoria, alongside recent Warner Bros. theatrical hits like Dune: Part Two and Barbie. The addition of Discovery content brings in reality favorites such as Fixer Upper: The Hotel and 90 Day Fiancé, while sports coverage through TNT and TBS channels includes NHL, NASCAR, college football and more. It’s worth noting that live sports are still limited to certain tiers and regions and 4K availability varies by title. But compared with other premium services that have recently raised prices or limited simultaneous streams, HBO Max’s current setup offers strong flexibility across its plans. If you’re considering which streaming platform gives the best range of new shows, live events and cinema releases, our guide to the best streaming services compares HBO Max with other major options. For now, this one-year subscription offer provides a straightforward way to explore HBO’s latest hits and a wide catalog of content at a lower upfront cost. There are plenty of other Cyber Monday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for cyber Monday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Cyber Monday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads.

          "title": "Cyber Monday subscription and streaming deals are here: Big discounts on Apple TV+, HBO Max, Disney+, Proton VPN and more",
          "standfirst": "A lot of people think Cyber Monday subscriptions are just about streaming, but that's not true. Although there are some incredible discounts to be had on the likes of Apple TV+ (Severance and Ted Lasso), HBO Max (House of the Dragon and The Last of Us) and Disney+/Hulu (you know what they've got), there's more to the story. We've also found great deals on exciting learning platforms like MasterClass and Rosetta Stone, cord-cutting services like DirecTV and Fubo and useful privacy services like DeleteMe and Proton VPN. Read on to see which deals are still active. Best Cyber Monday streaming deals HBO Max (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): HBO Max's streaming lineup needs no introduction — The Sopranos, House of the Dragon, Sex and the City, The White Lotus and The Last of Us are all in the Max mix, plus dozens more of the shows that build and sustain Peak TV. This deal comes with access to Warner Brothers film hits like Barbie and Dune, plus Discovery's reality lineup like Deadliest Catch and Naked and Afraid. This one-year subscription is the version with ads, but the savings are massive enough to make that worthwhile. If you're already a Prime Video subscriber, you can get the same deal there as an add-on. Disney+ and Hulu bundle with ads (one year) for $60 (61 percent off): Disney took its time announcing its Cyber Monday deal on the newly merging Disney+ and Hulu, but the wait was worth it. This steep discount saves you more than 60 percent over the regular monthly price. Just in time for family gatherings, you'll have access to Zootopia and Inside Out 2 for the kids, Shogun and The Bear for the adults, and Marvel and Star Wars adventures for everybody. Starz (one year) for $12 ($58 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library, including Outlander and Spartacus, with offline viewing and no ads. Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Cyber Monday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Lower Decks, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Fubo Pro (first month) for $55 (35 percent off): Fubo is the live TV service that helps sports lovers cut the cord. When you sign up, it asks you your favorite teams, then automatically records every game they play. Fubo Pro includes 249 channels, covering everything from your local NFL and NBA networks to real ESPN8 (The Ocho) content like PowerSports World. There are even plenty of non-sports channels, and with 10 allowed screens per subscription, your whole family can enjoy the selection at once. DirectTV (first month) for $50 (44 percent off): If you're a cord-cutter with a more general taste in TV, DirectTV is the perfect way for you to keep enjoying live channels without cable. This deal only applies for your first month, but it's great for seeing if DirectTV will work for you long-term. Better yet, any DirectTV subscription also comes with free access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Unlimited. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 (80 percent off): Sling TV is one of the best live streaming services, and has one of streaming TV's most unique deals: a commitment-free day pass that lets you stream whatever you want for 24 hours, including cable channels and exclusive sports. Normally, a day pass costs $5, but this Cyber Monday deal knocks that all the way down to $1. Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): A Plex server is a way to organize your own digital media library, making it as accessible as the Netflix homepage and as permanent as your college DVD collection. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from Seven Samurai and Apocalypse Now to Dawson's Creek and Veronica Mars. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Walmart+ (one year) for $49 (50 percent off): No, Walmart hasn't started its own streaming platform, but it would probably have some pretty great drama. What you do get with Walmart+ is free shipping on carts over $35, exclusive deals, drone delivery in some cities and more. And if you did come here for streaming, Walmart+ also comes with your choice of Peacock Premium of Paramount+ Essential (we recommend Peacock Premium because it's more expensive on its own). Hallmark+ (three months) for $1 (88 percent off) with coupon code BFCM3MO: Right now, you can get three months of access to Hallmark content for way less than one of their greeting cards costs these days. This pocket change doesn't just get you a frightening number of adorable Christmas movies, but a surprising range of classic TV series, including Cheers, Frasier and Golden Girls, plus newer obsessions like When Calls the Heart. Fox One (two months) for $20 (50 percent off): Fox One is the newest streaming service on this list, launching just this August. It provides access to everything in the Fox catalog, including its sports and entertainment TV. Two months for $20 isn't quite as good a deal as Paramount+ is giving out, but it may still be a bargain if you're worried about losing Fox channels from your YouTube TV subscription. Best Cyber Monday subscription deals Audible (three months) for $3 (80 percent off): For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobook lover can cram a lot of listening into the 90 days after Cyber Monday. Quicken Simplifi (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): We named Quicken Simplifi the best budgeting app this year because (true to its name) it's the cleanest budgeting app on the market, with an interface designed to welcome newcomers and no key information more than a scroll away. It's also cheap, especially with this Cyber Monday deal, and very good at detecting and categorizing your important transactions. Monarch Money (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): Monarch Money, our other favorite budgeting app, is giving new users half off for Cyber Monday. It's a little more complex than Quicken Simplifi, but it also gives you finer-grained control, including detailed reporting, balance sheets and instant graphs. The standout goals feature lets you establish savings and wealth baselines that feel amazing when you hit them. Rosetta Stone Lifetime Unlimited subscription for $149 (60 percent off): Rosetta Stone was pioneering visual language courses back when software still came in boxes, and it's still one of the best language learning apps. Today, its method works as well as ever, with patient learning based on pictures, terms and recordings. This deal gets you a full lifetime subscription with access to all 25 languages in the library. Medium (one year) for $40 (20 percent off): Medium is a social site designed as the anti-Twitter, featuring deep thoughts and long-form essays from great writers. Not all its best work is locked behind a paywall, but a lot of it is — and we've all had the feeling of being frustrated that we can't read the latest drop from a thinker we really respect. This deal isn't a very big cut, but it is a noticeable savings over the monthly plan, which will cost you a full $120 for the same length of time ($150 without the discount). Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite. It doesn't just help you relax and de-stress, but also teaches you to practice meditation as a skill, with sessions building on each other in organized courses. There's a massive library of standalone guided meditations with all kinds of instructors, and it's easy to search for the ones that work best for you. This deal gives you half off a full year. Calm Premium (one year) for $40 (50 percent off): Once you've finished your Headspace meditation, head over to Calm for every other stress-relieving activity you can think of. This subscription lets you relax amid a massive content library, from music and restful soundscapes to \"sleep stories\" with celebrity narrators telling bedtime stories for children and adults alike. If you've ever wanted to be lulled to sleep by Jonathan Bailey, Matthew McConaughey or Idris Elba, this app is for you. AdGuard personal (lifetime) for $44 (45 percent off): AdGuard was recently in the news for automatically blocking Microsoft's Recall AI surveillance app, which is a great indication of its mission — it fights threats to your privacy, no matter where they come from. This lifetime subscription blocks all annoying third-party ads and trackers on any website while keeping its functionality otherwise unchanged, so everything loads faster and easier. 1Password (one year) for $29 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. LastPass Premium (one year) for $18 (50 percent off): LastPass is another great password manager. We briefly stopped recommending it after a couple of data breaches early last year, but it's patched up its security and seems to be firing on all cylinders again. Whether it suits you better than 1Password will come down to personal preference, but LastPass's deal is slightly better this year. DeleteMe (all services) for 30 percent off with code BFCM30OFF25: DeleteMe scrubs your information from people search sites and other public-facing data brokers, dramatically reducing your online presence. It's a time-saving and user-friendly automation of a process that can be a real hassle without it. Since using it monthly, we've noticed a sharp decrease in the amount of spam emails, texts and calls to our personal addresses. Adobe Creative Cloud (one year) for $389 (50 percent off): Adobe Creative Cloud is half off for one year right now, coming out to $389 for one year when you pay upfront. (There's a discounted $35 monthly rate as well, working out to $420 for the year.) Creative Cloud is Adobe's most comprehensive design package, including InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere and over 20 other apps. Whip up a website with Dreamweaver, paint on a digital canvas with Fresco or edit photos in Lightroom. It's a pretty steep cost for an individual, but puts a one-year subscription well within reach of a creative business. The Wall Street Journal (one year) for $12 (90 percent off): Let's get really old-school for a moment. If you want to add some classic journalism to your diet (and you're OK with ignoring a right-leaning opinion page), one of America's \"papers of record\" is cutting annual subscription costs by 90 percent. That's enough to get you financial, US and world news all the way to the next Cyber Monday, when they'll probably do this again. Infinite money glitch! Best VPN deals for Cyber Monday ExpressVPN Basic (28 months) for $97.72 (73 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries. It also basically never drops the price this low, so if you're at all interested, now's the time to board the Express train. Surfshark Starter (27 months) for $53.73 (87 percent off): According to the tests we ran for our latest review, Surfshark is the fastest VPN right now, with its download speeds, upload speeds and latencies all beating out competitors. It has more to offer beyond speed, too, as it's able to constantly rotate your IP address and generate double VPN paths between any two servers you choose. NordVPN Basic (27 months) for $80.73 (74 percent off): NordVPN got very positive marks in our last review, where we called out its fast internet speeds, wide network of server locations and selection of exclusive features. It comes with a range of dedicated servers for obfuscation, onion routing, torrenting and more. Plus, it's one of the first VPNs getting a jump on post-quantum encryption. CyberGhost VPN (28 months) for $56.94 (84 percent off): CyberGhost is always cheap — in fact, we named it the best budget VPN — but it's never behaved like an economy option. Its Smart Rules automation controls are the deepest in the industry, and its server network reaches 100 countries. Speeds are also quite good, though connections occasionally take a moment to establish. hide.me VPN (26 months) for $99.95 (61 percent off): hide.me is currently our favorite free VPN, but its paid upgrade is just as competitive. The best thing about this deal is that you're guaranteed to get renewed at the same price and duration, which isn't always certain, even with otherwise reliable VPNs. hide.me gives you servers in 91 locations, all of them rated for up to a gigabyte of traffic per second. Private Internet Access VPN (40 months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Although we weren't wholly positive about Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) in our recent review, we can't deny it's a worthwhile choice for an affordable VPN. Although speeds can fluctuate, it comes with lots of desirable features on all platforms, like port forwarding (which makes torrents more stable) and two kinds of split tunneling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-subscription-and-streaming-deals-are-here-big-discounts-on-apple-tv-hbo-max-disney-proton-vpn-and-more-174507016.html?src=rss",
          "content": "A lot of people think Cyber Monday subscriptions are just about streaming, but that's not true. Although there are some incredible discounts to be had on the likes of Apple TV+ (Severance and Ted Lasso), HBO Max (House of the Dragon and The Last of Us) and Disney+/Hulu (you know what they've got), there's more to the story. We've also found great deals on exciting learning platforms like MasterClass and Rosetta Stone, cord-cutting services like DirecTV and Fubo and useful privacy services like DeleteMe and Proton VPN. Read on to see which deals are still active. Best Cyber Monday streaming deals HBO Max (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): HBO Max's streaming lineup needs no introduction — The Sopranos, House of the Dragon, Sex and the City, The White Lotus and The Last of Us are all in the Max mix, plus dozens more of the shows that build and sustain Peak TV. This deal comes with access to Warner Brothers film hits like Barbie and Dune, plus Discovery's reality lineup like Deadliest Catch and Naked and Afraid. This one-year subscription is the version with ads, but the savings are massive enough to make that worthwhile. If you're already a Prime Video subscriber, you can get the same deal there as an add-on. Disney+ and Hulu bundle with ads (one year) for $60 (61 percent off): Disney took its time announcing its Cyber Monday deal on the newly merging Disney+ and Hulu, but the wait was worth it. This steep discount saves you more than 60 percent over the regular monthly price. Just in time for family gatherings, you'll have access to Zootopia and Inside Out 2 for the kids, Shogun and The Bear for the adults, and Marvel and Star Wars adventures for everybody. Starz (one year) for $12 ($58 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library, including Outlander and Spartacus, with offline viewing and no ads. Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Cyber Monday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Lower Decks, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Fubo Pro (first month) for $55 (35 percent off): Fubo is the live TV service that helps sports lovers cut the cord. When you sign up, it asks you your favorite teams, then automatically records every game they play. Fubo Pro includes 249 channels, covering everything from your local NFL and NBA networks to real ESPN8 (The Ocho) content like PowerSports World. There are even plenty of non-sports channels, and with 10 allowed screens per subscription, your whole family can enjoy the selection at once. DirectTV (first month) for $50 (44 percent off): If you're a cord-cutter with a more general taste in TV, DirectTV is the perfect way for you to keep enjoying live channels without cable. This deal only applies for your first month, but it's great for seeing if DirectTV will work for you long-term. Better yet, any DirectTV subscription also comes with free access to Disney+, Hulu and ESPN Unlimited. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 (80 percent off): Sling TV is one of the best live streaming services, and has one of streaming TV's most unique deals: a commitment-free day pass that lets you stream whatever you want for 24 hours, including cable channels and exclusive sports. Normally, a day pass costs $5, but this Cyber Monday deal knocks that all the way down to $1. Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): A Plex server is a way to organize your own digital media library, making it as accessible as the Netflix homepage and as permanent as your college DVD collection. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from Seven Samurai and Apocalypse Now to Dawson's Creek and Veronica Mars. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Walmart+ (one year) for $49 (50 percent off): No, Walmart hasn't started its own streaming platform, but it would probably have some pretty great drama. What you do get with Walmart+ is free shipping on carts over $35, exclusive deals, drone delivery in some cities and more. And if you did come here for streaming, Walmart+ also comes with your choice of Peacock Premium of Paramount+ Essential (we recommend Peacock Premium because it's more expensive on its own). Hallmark+ (three months) for $1 (88 percent off) with coupon code BFCM3MO: Right now, you can get three months of access to Hallmark content for way less than one of their greeting cards costs these days. This pocket change doesn't just get you a frightening number of adorable Christmas movies, but a surprising range of classic TV series, including Cheers, Frasier and Golden Girls, plus newer obsessions like When Calls the Heart. Fox One (two months) for $20 (50 percent off): Fox One is the newest streaming service on this list, launching just this August. It provides access to everything in the Fox catalog, including its sports and entertainment TV. Two months for $20 isn't quite as good a deal as Paramount+ is giving out, but it may still be a bargain if you're worried about losing Fox channels from your YouTube TV subscription. Best Cyber Monday subscription deals Audible (three months) for $3 (80 percent off): For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobook lover can cram a lot of listening into the 90 days after Cyber Monday. Quicken Simplifi (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): We named Quicken Simplifi the best budgeting app this year because (true to its name) it's the cleanest budgeting app on the market, with an interface designed to welcome newcomers and no key information more than a scroll away. It's also cheap, especially with this Cyber Monday deal, and very good at detecting and categorizing your important transactions. Monarch Money (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): Monarch Money, our other favorite budgeting app, is giving new users half off for Cyber Monday. It's a little more complex than Quicken Simplifi, but it also gives you finer-grained control, including detailed reporting, balance sheets and instant graphs. The standout goals feature lets you establish savings and wealth baselines that feel amazing when you hit them. Rosetta Stone Lifetime Unlimited subscription for $149 (60 percent off): Rosetta Stone was pioneering visual language courses back when software still came in boxes, and it's still one of the best language learning apps. Today, its method works as well as ever, with patient learning based on pictures, terms and recordings. This deal gets you a full lifetime subscription with access to all 25 languages in the library. Medium (one year) for $40 (20 percent off): Medium is a social site designed as the anti-Twitter, featuring deep thoughts and long-form essays from great writers. Not all its best work is locked behind a paywall, but a lot of it is — and we've all had the feeling of being frustrated that we can't read the latest drop from a thinker we really respect. This deal isn't a very big cut, but it is a noticeable savings over the monthly plan, which will cost you a full $120 for the same length of time ($150 without the discount). Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite. It doesn't just help you relax and de-stress, but also teaches you to practice meditation as a skill, with sessions building on each other in organized courses. There's a massive library of standalone guided meditations with all kinds of instructors, and it's easy to search for the ones that work best for you. This deal gives you half off a full year. Calm Premium (one year) for $40 (50 percent off): Once you've finished your Headspace meditation, head over to Calm for every other stress-relieving activity you can think of. This subscription lets you relax amid a massive content library, from music and restful soundscapes to \"sleep stories\" with celebrity narrators telling bedtime stories for children and adults alike. If you've ever wanted to be lulled to sleep by Jonathan Bailey, Matthew McConaughey or Idris Elba, this app is for you. AdGuard personal (lifetime) for $44 (45 percent off): AdGuard was recently in the news for automatically blocking Microsoft's Recall AI surveillance app, which is a great indication of its mission — it fights threats to your privacy, no matter where they come from. This lifetime subscription blocks all annoying third-party ads and trackers on any website while keeping its functionality otherwise unchanged, so everything loads faster and easier. 1Password (one year) for $29 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. LastPass Premium (one year) for $18 (50 percent off): LastPass is another great password manager. We briefly stopped recommending it after a couple of data breaches early last year, but it's patched up its security and seems to be firing on all cylinders again. Whether it suits you better than 1Password will come down to personal preference, but LastPass's deal is slightly better this year. DeleteMe (all services) for 30 percent off with code BFCM30OFF25: DeleteMe scrubs your information from people search sites and other public-facing data brokers, dramatically reducing your online presence. It's a time-saving and user-friendly automation of a process that can be a real hassle without it. Since using it monthly, we've noticed a sharp decrease in the amount of spam emails, texts and calls to our personal addresses. Adobe Creative Cloud (one year) for $389 (50 percent off): Adobe Creative Cloud is half off for one year right now, coming out to $389 for one year when you pay upfront. (There's a discounted $35 monthly rate as well, working out to $420 for the year.) Creative Cloud is Adobe's most comprehensive design package, including InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere and over 20 other apps. Whip up a website with Dreamweaver, paint on a digital canvas with Fresco or edit photos in Lightroom. It's a pretty steep cost for an individual, but puts a one-year subscription well within reach of a creative business. The Wall Street Journal (one year) for $12 (90 percent off): Let's get really old-school for a moment. If you want to add some classic journalism to your diet (and you're OK with ignoring a right-leaning opinion page), one of America's \"papers of record\" is cutting annual subscription costs by 90 percent. That's enough to get you financial, US and world news all the way to the next Cyber Monday, when they'll probably do this again. Infinite money glitch! Best VPN deals for Cyber Monday ExpressVPN Basic (28 months) for $97.72 (73 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries. It also basically never drops the price this low, so if you're at all interested, now's the time to board the Express train. Surfshark Starter (27 months) for $53.73 (87 percent off): According to the tests we ran for our latest review, Surfshark is the fastest VPN right now, with its download speeds, upload speeds and latencies all beating out competitors. It has more to offer beyond speed, too, as it's able to constantly rotate your IP address and generate double VPN paths between any two servers you choose. NordVPN Basic (27 months) for $80.73 (74 percent off): NordVPN got very positive marks in our last review, where we called out its fast internet speeds, wide network of server locations and selection of exclusive features. It comes with a range of dedicated servers for obfuscation, onion routing, torrenting and more. Plus, it's one of the first VPNs getting a jump on post-quantum encryption. CyberGhost VPN (28 months) for $56.94 (84 percent off): CyberGhost is always cheap — in fact, we named it the best budget VPN — but it's never behaved like an economy option. Its Smart Rules automation controls are the deepest in the industry, and its server network reaches 100 countries. Speeds are also quite good, though connections occasionally take a moment to establish. hide.me VPN (26 months) for $99.95 (61 percent off): hide.me is currently our favorite free VPN, but its paid upgrade is just as competitive. The best thing about this deal is that you're guaranteed to get renewed at the same price and duration, which isn't always certain, even with otherwise reliable VPNs. hide.me gives you servers in 91 locations, all of them rated for up to a gigabyte of traffic per second. Private Internet Access VPN (40 months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Although we weren't wholly positive about Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) in our recent review, we can't deny it's a worthwhile choice for an affordable VPN. Although speeds can fluctuate, it comes with lots of desirable features on all platforms, like port forwarding (which makes torrents more stable) and two kinds of split tunneling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-subscription-and-streaming-deals-are-here-big-discounts-on-apple-tv-hbo-max-disney-proton-vpn-and-more-174507016.html?src=rss",

          "title": "This Apple TV+ Cyber Monday streaming deal ends soon: Get six months of access for only $6 per month",
          "standfirst": "Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Cyber Monday. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. It’s a short-term offer, so you’ll want to grab it while it’s available before Cyber Monday ends. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Apple TV+ continues to have one of the strongest and most varied lineups in streaming. Its library includes standout originals like Ted Lasso, Severance, Slow Horses, For All Mankind, Foundation and Silo, along with newer releases such as The Studio and Dope Thief. On the film side, you’ll find the 2022 Best Picture winner CODA, plus Killers of the Flower Moon, Blitz and Tetris. Apple’s streaming service has earned plenty of recognition since launch. Apple TV+ shows picked up 10 Emmy Awards in 2024, including a win for Slow Horses for outstanding writing in a drama series. Apple TV+ also offers a polished streaming experience. All content is ad-free and available in up to 4K HDR, with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support where available. The app works on nearly every device, from iPhone and iPad to smart TVs, PlayStation, Xbox and Roku. You can also download episodes and movies to watch offline, which is handy for travel or long commutes. If you’re already invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the integration is seamless. You can share your subscription with up to five other people through Family Sharing, and playback syncs across devices so you can start a show on your iPhone and finish it on your TV. Apple TV+ is also part of the Apple One bundle if you prefer to manage multiple Apple services under a single plan. This deal is available to new and qualified returning subscribers, meaning those who haven’t had an active subscription in the past 30 days. You’ll need to sign up directly through Apple rather than a third-party service or carrier. Once the three-month period ends, the plan renews at the standard $13 per month, so be sure to cancel before the renewal date if you don’t want to continue. With a growing slate of original series, award-winning films and a slick interface, Apple TV+ has turned into one of the best streaming services for premium content. And with this limited-time deal, you can catch up on its biggest hits without paying full price. There are plenty of other Cyber Monday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Cyber Monday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Cyber Monday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Cyber Monday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month.

          "title": "Cyber Monday TV deals include sets from Samsung, LG, Sony and more at all-time low prices",
          "standfirst": "Like Black Friday, Cyber Monday is traditionally one of the best times to buy a new TV. If you’re hoping to make a living room upgrade, we’ve scoured the web and picked out the best Cyber Monday TV deals we could find. The discounts include well-reviewed OLED TVs and budget sets alike from Samsung, LG, Sony, TCL and Hisense. For those happy with their current TV, there are also several deals on media streamers and streaming services we like. Best Cyber Monday TV deals: Under $500 Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 at Amazon ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is an entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the competing TCL QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so that model should be a better buy for most. This set also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($890) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Best Cyber Monday TV deals: Between $500 and $1,000 TCL QM6K (75-inch) for $698 at Amazon ($302 off): The aforementioned QM6K is widely regarded as one of this year’s better TV bargains. As a more budget-friendly model, it won’t get you top-notch contrast, color volume, brightness or HDR performance, but its quantum-dot color, mini-LED backlighting and full-array local dimming help it more than hold its own for the money. It’s a nice buy for gaming on a budget as well, since its input lag is relatively low and it has a fast 144Hz refresh rate that can reach as high at 288Hz if you play in 1080p. This deal matches an all-time low for the 75-inch model. LG B5 (48-inch) for $550 at Best Buy ($770 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025. It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion and so on — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, nor does it look quite as colorful. (The C5 isn't significantly discounted as of this writing.) It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz, too, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. This deal is within $20 of the all-time low we saw on Black Friday. The 55-inch model is on sale for a low of $897 as well. Also at LG. Hisense U75QG (55-inch) for $498 at Amazon ($416 off): The Hisense U75QG is a close competitor to the QM7K. Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, some reviews say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content too bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, so it's not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is a new low for the 55-inch set. The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. Samsung The Frame TV (2024) 55-inch LED TV for $700 at Best Buy ($198 off): You shouldn’t buy a Samsung’s Frame TV if you want the best picture quality for your dollar: They lack local dimming and Dolby Vision HDR, and some cheaper alternatives lap them when it comes to brightness and contrast. Instead, you’d buy one if care about your TV’s aesthetic above all else, since they’re designed to look like a framed piece of wall art. This set also has a matte screen finish, so it holds up well against direct reflections. This discount drops the 55-inch version to a new all-time low. Just note that we’re highlighting the 2024 model; this year’s edition is also on sale, but its panel still isn’t great the price, so we recommend saving as much cash as possible if you’re dead-set on buying one of these things. Also at Amazon. Best Cyber Monday TV deals: $1,000 and up Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that's received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. LG G5 (65-inch) for $1,997 at Amazon ($400 off): The LG G5 is the S95F’s chief rival at the top of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter, it does support Dolby Vision and its glossy finish means it won’t lose those inky blacks under ambient light. It’s more susceptible to glare, however, and while its picture is a level above most WOLED TVs, it’s still a step behind QD-OLED sets like the S95F when it comes to color volume. But if you’re mostly going to watch things away from direct light, this might be the better buy. This deal has technically been live for a few weeks, but it matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Sony Bravia A95L (55-inch) for $1,600 at Best Buy ($1,200 off): The A95L is an older QD-OLED TV from Sony released in 2023, but many reviews conclude that it isn’t far off its 2025 successor, the Bravia 8 II, which currently costs $400 extra. Like many premium Sony TVs, it’s earned praise for its excellent image processing, upscaling of lower-quality video and overall accuracy, so it should appeal to those who want movies and shows to look closer to their creators’ original intent. As a QD-OLED TV, it can display more vivid colors than lower-priced WOLED panels, plus it supports Dolby Vision HDR. Still-great competitors like the Samsung S90F and LG C5 cost hundreds less, however, while top-end models like the Samsung S95F and LG G5 can get noticeably brighter. The A95L also isn’t the best for gamers at this price, as it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher than those rivals. But if you’re fine with all of that, this deal ties the all-time low for the 55-inch model. Also at Sony. TCL QM8K (75-inch) for $1,400 at Best Buy ($600 off): If you’re willing to pay an OLED-level price but want the increased brightness of a high-end LED TV, the TCL QM8K is worth a look. It won’t be as good in a dark room as something like the Samsung S90F or LG C5, as its contrast isn’t as deep and black tones aren’t as uniformly dark. Its viewing angles are clearly worse, too. But reviews say it still performs excellently compared to other LED sets, and since it gets way brighter than most OLED alternatives (especially with non-HDR content), it can better withstand glare. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate with support for 288Hz at 1080p, though it only comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports, and it’s not available in a size smaller than 65 inches. This is the best price we’ve seen for the 75-inch variant. Also at Amazon. Best Cyber Monday streaming device deals Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you want a cheaper stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you just prefer Roku’s app-based UI, which many find simpler to navigate than the alternatives from Google and Amazon. Performance is fine, if not super-fast, and the device supports Apple AirPlay as well. Just expect to see some ads and know there’s no Twitch app. This deal matches the stick’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 at Amazon ($21 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is a cheaper version of the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender included. It may be less reliable with choppier internet connections as a result, but it can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port, it can still stream up to 4K, and the software experience is identical. Most people should probably just spend the extra $5 for the Streaming Stick 4K, but if you’re really looking to save, the Plus is a decent value. This deal is a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Roku Ultra for $69 at Amazon ($31 off): The Ultra might be worth it if you want the Roku experience in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finding tool and backlit buttons. (Though you can buy that separately.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support, though it’s not as snappy as other boxes like the Google TV Streamer 4K or Apple TV 4K. This deal ties the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): If you'd prefer one of Amazon's media streamers, the newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses. Just keep in mind that its Fire OS interface is still fairly ad-heavy and prioritizes Amazon’s own apps over everything else. This deal is $3 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in the past year. Also at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want the best Amazon streaming stick possible, the 4K Max gets you faster hardware than the Plus model and may be worthwhile if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router at home. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Also at Best Buy and Target. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you want to stick with Amazon and just need to add streaming apps to an old TV for as little as possible, it’ll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Target. Best Cyber Monday streaming service deals Apple TV 6-month subscription for $36 at Apple ($42 off): Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for $36, which comes out to $6 per month for the discounted period. The deal is live for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Slow Horses, The Morning Show or Pluribus for less. The big caveat here is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not a third-party service. HBO Max 1-year subscription for $36 at HBO ($96 off): HBO Max's holiday deal gives subscribers one year of its ad-supported tier for $3 per month, or $36 total, through December 1. Normally, this would cost $11 per month. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're already a Prime Video subscriber, via that service as an add-on. Paramount+ 2-month Premium subscription for $6 at Paramount ($20 off): If you're looking to stream CBS shows or Champions League soccer, this deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to $6 total for two months. The obvious better deal is for the ad-free Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month, but be warned your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-tv-deals-include-sets-from-samsung-lg-sony-and-more-at-all-time-low-prices-190000974.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Like Black Friday, Cyber Monday is traditionally one of the best times to buy a new TV. If you’re hoping to make a living room upgrade, we’ve scoured the web and picked out the best Cyber Monday TV deals we could find. The discounts include well-reviewed OLED TVs and budget sets alike from Samsung, LG, Sony, TCL and Hisense. For those happy with their current TV, there are also several deals on media streamers and streaming services we like. Best Cyber Monday TV deals: Under $500 Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 at Amazon ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is an entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the competing TCL QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so that model should be a better buy for most. This set also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($890) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Best Cyber Monday TV deals: Between $500 and $1,000 TCL QM6K (75-inch) for $698 at Amazon ($302 off): The aforementioned QM6K is widely regarded as one of this year’s better TV bargains. As a more budget-friendly model, it won’t get you top-notch contrast, color volume, brightness or HDR performance, but its quantum-dot color, mini-LED backlighting and full-array local dimming help it more than hold its own for the money. It’s a nice buy for gaming on a budget as well, since its input lag is relatively low and it has a fast 144Hz refresh rate that can reach as high at 288Hz if you play in 1080p. This deal matches an all-time low for the 75-inch model. LG B5 (48-inch) for $550 at Best Buy ($770 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025. It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion and so on — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, nor does it look quite as colorful. (The C5 isn't significantly discounted as of this writing.) It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz, too, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. This deal is within $20 of the all-time low we saw on Black Friday. The 55-inch model is on sale for a low of $897 as well. Also at LG. Hisense U75QG (55-inch) for $498 at Amazon ($416 off): The Hisense U75QG is a close competitor to the QM7K. Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, some reviews say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content too bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, so it's not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is a new low for the 55-inch set. The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. Samsung The Frame TV (2024) 55-inch LED TV for $700 at Best Buy ($198 off): You shouldn’t buy a Samsung’s Frame TV if you want the best picture quality for your dollar: They lack local dimming and Dolby Vision HDR, and some cheaper alternatives lap them when it comes to brightness and contrast. Instead, you’d buy one if care about your TV’s aesthetic above all else, since they’re designed to look like a framed piece of wall art. This set also has a matte screen finish, so it holds up well against direct reflections. This discount drops the 55-inch version to a new all-time low. Just note that we’re highlighting the 2024 model; this year’s edition is also on sale, but its panel still isn’t great the price, so we recommend saving as much cash as possible if you’re dead-set on buying one of these things. Also at Amazon. Best Cyber Monday TV deals: $1,000 and up Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that's received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. LG G5 (65-inch) for $1,997 at Amazon ($400 off): The LG G5 is the S95F’s chief rival at the top of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter, it does support Dolby Vision and its glossy finish means it won’t lose those inky blacks under ambient light. It’s more susceptible to glare, however, and while its picture is a level above most WOLED TVs, it’s still a step behind QD-OLED sets like the S95F when it comes to color volume. But if you’re mostly going to watch things away from direct light, this might be the better buy. This deal has technically been live for a few weeks, but it matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Sony Bravia A95L (55-inch) for $1,600 at Best Buy ($1,200 off): The A95L is an older QD-OLED TV from Sony released in 2023, but many reviews conclude that it isn’t far off its 2025 successor, the Bravia 8 II, which currently costs $400 extra. Like many premium Sony TVs, it’s earned praise for its excellent image processing, upscaling of lower-quality video and overall accuracy, so it should appeal to those who want movies and shows to look closer to their creators’ original intent. As a QD-OLED TV, it can display more vivid colors than lower-priced WOLED panels, plus it supports Dolby Vision HDR. Still-great competitors like the Samsung S90F and LG C5 cost hundreds less, however, while top-end models like the Samsung S95F and LG G5 can get noticeably brighter. The A95L also isn’t the best for gamers at this price, as it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher than those rivals. But if you’re fine with all of that, this deal ties the all-time low for the 55-inch model. Also at Sony. TCL QM8K (75-inch) for $1,400 at Best Buy ($600 off): If you’re willing to pay an OLED-level price but want the increased brightness of a high-end LED TV, the TCL QM8K is worth a look. It won’t be as good in a dark room as something like the Samsung S90F or LG C5, as its contrast isn’t as deep and black tones aren’t as uniformly dark. Its viewing angles are clearly worse, too. But reviews say it still performs excellently compared to other LED sets, and since it gets way brighter than most OLED alternatives (especially with non-HDR content), it can better withstand glare. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate with support for 288Hz at 1080p, though it only comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports, and it’s not available in a size smaller than 65 inches. This is the best price we’ve seen for the 75-inch variant. Also at Amazon. Best Cyber Monday streaming device deals Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you want a cheaper stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you just prefer Roku’s app-based UI, which many find simpler to navigate than the alternatives from Google and Amazon. Performance is fine, if not super-fast, and the device supports Apple AirPlay as well. Just expect to see some ads and know there’s no Twitch app. This deal matches the stick’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 at Amazon ($21 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is a cheaper version of the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender included. It may be less reliable with choppier internet connections as a result, but it can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port, it can still stream up to 4K, and the software experience is identical. Most people should probably just spend the extra $5 for the Streaming Stick 4K, but if you’re really looking to save, the Plus is a decent value. This deal is a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Roku Ultra for $69 at Amazon ($31 off): The Ultra might be worth it if you want the Roku experience in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finding tool and backlit buttons. (Though you can buy that separately.)

Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): If you'd prefer one of Amazon's media streamers, the newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses. Just keep in mind that its Fire OS interface is still fairly ad-heavy and prioritizes Amazon’s own apps over everything else. This deal is $3 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in the past year. Also at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want the best Amazon streaming stick possible, the 4K Max gets you faster hardware than the Plus model and may be worthwhile if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router at home. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Also at Best Buy and Target. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you want to stick with Amazon and just need to add streaming apps to an old TV for as little as possible, it’ll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked.

          "standfirst": "If you've ever wanted to hear the drummer coughing on your favorite songs or the actors chewing in your favorite shows, Cyber Monday is the time to upgrade your audio. Some of the best speakers our audiophiles have ever tested are down to as low as we've seen them all year, or ever, in the case of some older models. The deals on this list range across brands, with offerings from Ultimate Ears, Bose, Beats and more, plus Sonos and Amazon Echo smart speakers and soundbars from Sony and JBL. We've been curating it all month and this is the final result — and your last chance to get ahold of most of the best deals. Some of them may last through the week, but we can't always predict which ones, so don't sleep if there's a speaker you're eyeing. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals under $50 Anker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): It's incredibly rare to see a full-size Bluetooth speaker selling this cheaply in 2025, especially one we'd actually recommend using. The Soundcore 2 is Anker's latest audio effort, getting you 24 hours of battery and 12 watts of output, with bass ports designed to heavily boost the low ranges. It all works through a simple set of highly visible and tactile buttons on top of the speaker box. JBL Go 3 for $30 (25 percent off): The Go 3 is JBL's most affordable bluetooth speaker, but it comes with the same IP67-rated ruggedness as the more expensive models. It's waterproof, dustproof, lasts for five hours and can easily clip onto a bag, bike or belt. It also sounds good and comes in lots of different colors. In short, no matter how long the adventure or where it's going, the Go 3 can probably get there with you. Amazon Echo Dot 5th Gen for $32 (36 percent off): The fifth-generation Echo Dot is cheaper than ever, and it was already the best smart speaker under $50. Its genius spherical design lets it pack a lot of audio into a compact space, and it can be controlled with both hands-free Alexa commands and on-device buttons. The latest release comes with early access to the Alexa+ AI upgrade. JBL Go 4 for $40 (20 percent off): You might expect a speaker as small and portable as the Go 4 to sound tinny at the higher frequencies and weak at the lower ones, but JBL has worked its magic to make this model sound great at both ranges. Weighing less than half a pound, made partly from recycled materials and including a convenient carabiner hoop, this is one of our favorite speakers to take on treks. Tribit StormBox Micro 2 for $50 (29 percent off): The StormBox Micro 2 gets you the two things you need out of a portable speaker — it's light (weighing about a pound), and it's loud. Tribit hasn't changed the game on portable sound quality here, but with this on your bike or in your backyard, you'll be having so much fun you won't care. And the fact that you only spent 50 bucks will definitely help your mood. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 (38 percent off): The Echo Spot resembles an Echo Dot sliced in half, which is a much more enjoyable design than you'd think. It's designed to work best as a bedside alarm clock, but you can customize the screen to show things other than time, including a weather forecast, smart home controls or the current song on your playlist. It's Alexa-capable, and like the latest Echo Dot, will let you give Alexa+ AI a try. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals for $50 to $100 Roku Streambar SE for $75 (25 percent off): This is the least you'll pay for a worthwhile soundbar this Cyber Monday season. We had a great experience with the Roku Streambar in our hands-on review, finding it to be compact and affordable while blowing built-in TV speakers out of the water. If you're looking to make an upgrade, this is the best economy choice, especially if you're already a Roku user. JBL Flip 5 for $80 (20 percent off): We've loved almost every entry in the JBL Flip line (you'll see the Flip 7 highlighted in the next section). While the Flip 5 is a bit dated at this point, it's still extremely solid. The battery lasts for 12 hours, it's IPX7 waterproof and it weighs about 1.2 pounds so you can take it anywhere. The sound quality is as consistently high as we've come to expect from JBL, though it does have the standard limitations of a portable unit. Amazon Fire TV Soundbar for $85 (29 percent off): Amazon's soundbar supports Dolby surround sound, works straightforwardly through a single HDMI cable and can be upgraded with an optional Alexa voice assistant. It works with more than just Amazon products, too, being compatible with all smart TVs. It's even capable of pulling double duty as a bluetooth speaker. Marshall Emberton II for $90 (50 percent off): We're huge fans of the Emberton II, Marshall's affordable new-age retro speaker. It looks great, but it's much more than a visual throwback, featuring 360-degree sound, IP67 proofing and 30 hours of battery life. Since the deal cuts the price in half, you can even by two and chain them together for a surround sound setup. Amazon Echo Dot Max for $90 (10 percent off): The Echo Dot Max just dropped this month, and our reaction was mixed, but there's no denying the leaps forward in this brand-new addition. Not only does it feature better sound than the vanilla Echo Dot, but Alexa+ makes is a much more equal conversation partner. The Echo Dot Max features a similar spherical design to the Dot, but with forward-facing physical buttons on the surface of the sphere. Bose SoundLink Micro for $99 (17 percent off): If the Home isn't small or cheap enough for you, Bose has gone even smaller and cheaper with the SoundLink Micro, a tiny, portable speaker in the vein of the JBL Clip. It's waterproof, dustproof and surprisingly good at taking hits, all while staying charged for around six hours. The sound quality isn't intense, but it's cleaner than it has any right to be. Ultimate Ears Boom 4 for $100 (33 percent off): The UE speaker that started it all is often eclipsed by its siblings these days, but it can still hold its own as your main bluetooth speaker — especially at such a good price. For $100, you get 10 watts of power, giant user-friendly controls and the ability to start your favorite playlists with one touch on your phone. 360-degree sound can fill any room and travels a long way across almost any outdoor space. Beats Pill for $100 (33 percent off): Beats jumping back into portable bluetooth was one of the happiest surprises of 2024. As we noted in our full review at the time, the Beats Pill isn't content to coast on its brand name or luxurious design. Its re-engineering speaker improves volume while reducing distortion, it can survive dropping into three feet of water and it even works extremely well as a speakerphone. We found that mid-to-high range music showcases its potential best, though the bass also hits hard. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals for $100 to $200 Bose SoundLink Flex for $119 (20 percent off): Of all the Bose on this list, the SoundLink Flex may be the most balanced, much cheaper than the Home and a lot more powerful than the Micro. Other speakers may be louder, but few have such good range; we've yet to find a track that sounds muddy or tinny coming through the Flex's speakers. The design is also outdoor-friendly, with a light-but-tough exterior and 30-foot bluetooth range. JBL Charge 6 for $130 (35 percent off): It's a little more expensive than the Flip line, but the extra cost of the Charge 6 pays off — it boasts almost twice the battery life of the Flip 7, with the same convenient design, built-in USB-C charger and wide sound range. If you're looking for a speaker that balances sturdiness with portability and will last you a while, the Charge 6 is a very good investment. (Take note that only some colors are discounted.) Sonos Roam 2 for $139 (22 percent off): Last year, we were overjoyed to see that the Sonos Roam 2 fixed our main gripe with the Roam 1, its muddled button design. Without that drawback, the Roam is an outstanding portable speaker. It works over bluetooth without Wi-Fi, has a battery that lasts for 10 hours of continuous play and uses a combination of tweeters and woofers to keep sound ringing clear at any frequency and volume. Ultimate Ears Megaboom 4 for $150 (25 percent off): The UE Megaboom line is venerable at this point, dropping first in 2015, but its fourth iteration still tops our audiophile lists. It puts out 360-degree sound with an emphasis on bass, can work up to 147 feet away from the music source, and literally floats in water (though you probably shouldn't leave it in the pool all night). It can even pair with any other UE speaker through PartyUp — combining it with a couple of Wonderbooms pays off in spades. Sonos Era 100 for $169 (15 percent off): Two years after launch, the Era 100 is still a smart speaker more than worth your time. It's sleek and simply designed, making it clear Sonos's engineers put their work into sound quality and features rather than just looking the part. Touch controls have never worked better, and setup takes five minutes, though you will have to use the Sonos app. Once you start playing music, the Era 100 can get as loud as you like, while never sacrificing audio quality. Bose SoundLink Home for $179 (18 percent off): The SoundLink Home is small for a high-quality speaker, but it packs everything it needs into two pounds and about 10 square inches. Nothing about the sound is diminished thanks to two passive radiators. Though we haven't gotten to test it directly, given Bose's record with other compact speakers like the Flex, we're confident it'll be loud enough to satisfy anyone. Marshall Acton III for $180 (40 percent off): The Acton III is one of the speakers Marshall redesigned and updated in 2022, and it still sounds great today (and looks it too). It's less portable at 6.3 pounds, but can hit high volumes with little or no distortion. The upgrade angled Acton III's tweeters outward so the soundscape is wider, making this one speaker very capable of filling a room with sound on its own. Amazon Echo Studio for $190 (14 percent off): It may look a lot like the Echo Dot Max, but the Echo Studio is its own beast. It was just redesigned around Alexa+, but the fundamentals haven't changed — it's still capable of putting out immersive sound. The physical re-engineering also makes it fit better with your home decor, while the relocated light ring makes the whole device easier to interact with. Sony ULT Field 5 for $198 (43 percent off): Sony's recently rebranded ULT lineup has impressed us so far, especially their 90s-style bass boost buttons. The ULT Field 5 is a pretty traditional bluetooth speaker with a ton of options, including Party Connect to link multiple speakers together, a 10-band equalizer for finding the exact sound balance you want and even a shoulder strap that makes it way more portable. Bose TV Speaker soundbar for $199 (29 percent off): Bose's entry into the world of soundbars does not disappoint. For a price lower than some Bluetooth speakers, you'll get a compact two-foot speaker bar that amplifies dialogue while conjuring a balanced, realistic soundscape from any movie or show. It's suitable for audio neophytes, too, with no complex adjustments necessary — just plug in the HDMI and start watching. Samsung HW-B650/ZA 3.1 Channel Soundbar for $200 (50 percent off): Samsung's mid-range soundbar is pretty simple, but it does what it needs to do: pump out Dolby 3.1 with enough volume and range to make you forget you aren't in a movie theater. It's versatile, improving both music and dialogue, and keeps everything balanced. The only real drawback is that it lacks wireless connection options other than bluetooth. Ultimate Ears Everboom for $200 (26 percent off): We gave the Everboom a full review when it first dropped last year, and found it stuck to the general Ultimate Ears plan — nothing earth-shattering in the audio quality, but rugged reliability and fantastic extra features. Everboom users can connect it to the UE Boom app, which lets you control the volume remotely, use the speaker as a megaphone to make announcements, import your playlists and pair Everbooms through the PartyUp chaining feature. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals over $200 JBL Xtreme 4 for $280 (26 percent off): Xtreme is the largest and highest-end that JBL goes, and the Xtreme 4 is a luminary of the line. At 4.6 pounds, it's on the outside edge of portability, but that weight means it puts out appropriately heavy bass, along with clear treble. It's fully weatherproof and — unless it's in a completely open space — can get loud enough that all your party guests will enjoy the full effect. Bose SoundLink Max for $279 (30 percent off): The SoundLink Max, Bose's biggest speaker that isn't a soundbar, is more affordable for Cyber Monday than we've seen for a while. Frankly, it's worth more than this, with two radiators and three transducers that make it sound larger than it is. Indoors or outdoors, it's great for anyone who wants to be able to pick out individual elements of their favorite music. Marshall Stanmore III for $299 (21 percent off): The Stanmore III is the top-tier Marshall discount of the year, giving you the best of Marshall's 2022 redesign. It's got the same widened soundscape as the Acton III, with an additional 5Hz on the low end and an RCA input alongside its 3.5mm aux input. This retro-designed speaker also features bluetooth, pair play and a construction with 70 percent recycled plastic. Sonos Era 300 for $379 (21 percent off): The Era 300 is Sonos's big (and largely successful) swing at a truly space-filling smart speaker, combining spatial audio with support for both Alexa and its own assistant. The Trueplay feature detects the environment around the speaker and adjusts its setup to reach every corner. Spatial audio can be hit-or-miss on older tracks, but it's transcendent with modern ones. Sonos Move 2 for $399 (20 percent off): Move is Sonos's high-end portable smart speaker, with more heft, power and features than the smaller Roam line. With the Move 2, Sonos improved the Move's sound quality, boosted its battery life to well over 24 hours, jacked up the volume and redesigned the outer hardware for greater durability. It also works with both Alexa and the Sonos assistant, but it's more portable than the Era 300. Sony Bravia Theater Bar 8 for $798 (20 percent off): In our review of the Bravia 6 this year, we called out its full sound and special talent for enhancing dialogue, but were frustrated that it didn't support AirPlay or Spotify Connect. The Bravia 8 works with both services, making it a clear choice for your next premium soundbar. It's got a tight, low-footprint design that fits any aesthetic, and hits a maximum output power of 495 watts. Sonos Arc Ultra for $879 (20 percent off): The Sonos Arc Ultra is the best premium soundbar, bar none (pun intended). As we cover in our full review, it delivers full-throated bass without needing an extra sub, and has added more mid-range drivers and tweeters to make dialogue pop. Its software features are also solid, with Trueplay sound tuning, Speech Enhancement and a new Night Sound mode to tone down the boom for your roommates' sake. JBL Bar 1300XMK2 for $1,200 (29 percent off): If you're going to drop $1200 on a soundbar, you need to know it's going to deliver — and the 1300XMK2 does. Its key design element is two detachable speakers that recharge when plugged into the main unit, but can spend up to 10 hours unplugged. The audioscape does an excellent job of separating and clarifying details, which really enhances the sense of a theatrical experience.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-speaker-deals-for-2025-live-save-up-to-50-percent-on-bluetooth-speakers-smart-speakers-and-soundbars-220017225.html?src=rss",
          "content": "If you've ever wanted to hear the drummer coughing on your favorite songs or the actors chewing in your favorite shows, Cyber Monday is the time to upgrade your audio. Some of the best speakers our audiophiles have ever tested are down to as low as we've seen them all year, or ever, in the case of some older models. The deals on this list range across brands, with offerings from Ultimate Ears, Bose, Beats and more, plus Sonos and Amazon Echo smart speakers and soundbars from Sony and JBL. We've been curating it all month and this is the final result — and your last chance to get ahold of most of the best deals. Some of them may last through the week, but we can't always predict which ones, so don't sleep if there's a speaker you're eyeing. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals under $50 Anker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): It's incredibly rare to see a full-size Bluetooth speaker selling this cheaply in 2025, especially one we'd actually recommend using. The Soundcore 2 is Anker's latest audio effort, getting you 24 hours of battery and 12 watts of output, with bass ports designed to heavily boost the low ranges. It all works through a simple set of highly visible and tactile buttons on top of the speaker box. JBL Go 3 for $30 (25 percent off): The Go 3 is JBL's most affordable bluetooth speaker, but it comes with the same IP67-rated ruggedness as the more expensive models. It's waterproof, dustproof, lasts for five hours and can easily clip onto a bag, bike or belt. It also sounds good and comes in lots of different colors. In short, no matter how long the adventure or where it's going, the Go 3 can probably get there with you. Amazon Echo Dot 5th Gen for $32 (36 percent off): The fifth-generation Echo Dot is cheaper than ever, and it was already the best smart speaker under $50. Its genius spherical design lets it pack a lot of audio into a compact space, and it can be controlled with both hands-free Alexa commands and on-device buttons. The latest release comes with early access to the Alexa+ AI upgrade. JBL Go 4 for $40 (20 percent off): You might expect a speaker as small and portable as the Go 4 to sound tinny at the higher frequencies and weak at the lower ones, but JBL has worked its magic to make this model sound great at both ranges. Weighing less than half a pound, made partly from recycled materials and including a convenient carabiner hoop, this is one of our favorite speakers to take on treks. Tribit StormBox Micro 2 for $50 (29 percent off): The StormBox Micro 2 gets you the two things you need out of a portable speaker — it's light (weighing about a pound), and it's loud. Tribit hasn't changed the game on portable sound quality here, but with this on your bike or in your backyard, you'll be having so much fun you won't care. And the fact that you only spent 50 bucks will definitely help your mood. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 (38 percent off): The Echo Spot resembles an Echo Dot sliced in half, which is a much more enjoyable design than you'd think. It's designed to work best as a bedside alarm clock, but you can customize the screen to show things other than time, including a weather forecast, smart home controls or the current song on your playlist. It's Alexa-capable, and like the latest Echo Dot, will let you give Alexa+ AI a try. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals for $50 to $100 Roku Streambar SE for $75 (25 percent off): This is the least you'll pay for a worthwhile soundbar this Cyber Monday season. We had a great experience with the Roku Streambar in our hands-on review, finding it to be compact and affordable while blowing built-in TV speakers out of the water. If you're looking to make an upgrade, this is the best economy choice, especially if you're already a Roku user. JBL Flip 5 for $80 (20 percent off): We've loved almost every entry in the JBL Flip line (you'll see the Flip 7 highlighted in the next section). While the Flip 5 is a bit dated at this point, it's still extremely solid. The battery lasts for 12 hours, it's IPX7 waterproof and it weighs about 1.2 pounds so you can take it anywhere. The sound quality is as consistently high as we've come to expect from JBL, though it does have the standard limitations of a portable unit. Amazon Fire TV Soundbar for $85 (29 percent off): Amazon's soundbar supports Dolby surround sound, works straightforwardly through a single HDMI cable and can be upgraded with an optional Alexa voice assistant. It works with more than just Amazon products, too, being compatible with all smart TVs. It's even capable of pulling double duty as a bluetooth speaker. Marshall Emberton II for $90 (50 percent off): We're huge fans of the Emberton II, Marshall's affordable new-age retro speaker. It looks great, but it's much more than a visual throwback, featuring 360-degree sound, IP67 proofing and 30 hours of battery life. Since the deal cuts the price in half, you can even by two and chain them together for a surround sound setup. Amazon Echo Dot Max for $90 (10 percent off): The Echo Dot Max just dropped this month, and our reaction was mixed, but there's no denying the leaps forward in this brand-new addition. Not only does it feature better sound than the vanilla Echo Dot, but Alexa+ makes is a much more equal conversation partner. The Echo Dot Max features a similar spherical design to the Dot, but with forward-facing physical buttons on the surface of the sphere. Bose SoundLink Micro for $99 (17 percent off): If the Home isn't small or cheap enough for you, Bose has gone even smaller and cheaper with the SoundLink Micro, a tiny, portable speaker in the vein of the JBL Clip. It's waterproof, dustproof and surprisingly good at taking hits, all while staying charged for around six hours. The sound quality isn't intense, but it's cleaner than it has any right to be. Ultimate Ears Boom 4 for $100 (33 percent off): The UE speaker that started it all is often eclipsed by its siblings these days, but it can still hold its own as your main bluetooth speaker — especially at such a good price. For $100, you get 10 watts of power, giant user-friendly controls and the ability to start your favorite playlists with one touch on your phone. 360-degree sound can fill any room and travels a long way across almost any outdoor space. Beats Pill for $100 (33 percent off): Beats jumping back into portable bluetooth was one of the happiest surprises of 2024. As we noted in our full review at the time, the Beats Pill isn't content to coast on its brand name or luxurious design. Its re-engineering speaker improves volume while reducing distortion, it can survive dropping into three feet of water and it even works extremely well as a speakerphone. We found that mid-to-high range music showcases its potential best, though the bass also hits hard. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals for $100 to $200 Bose SoundLink Flex for $119 (20 percent off): Of all the Bose on this list, the SoundLink Flex may be the most balanced, much cheaper than the Home and a lot more powerful than the Micro. Other speakers may be louder, but few have such good range; we've yet to find a track that sounds muddy or tinny coming through the Flex's speakers. The design is also outdoor-friendly, with a light-but-tough exterior and 30-foot bluetooth range. JBL Charge 6 for $130 (35 percent off): It's a little more expensive than the Flip line, but the extra cost of the Charge 6 pays off — it boasts almost twice the battery life of the Flip 7, with the same convenient design, built-in USB-C charger and wide sound range. If you're looking for a speaker that balances sturdiness with portability and will last you a while, the Charge 6 is a very good investment. (Take note that only some colors are discounted.) Sonos Roam 2 for $139 (22 percent off): Last year, we were overjoyed to see that the Sonos Roam 2 fixed our main gripe with the Roam 1, its muddled button design. Without that drawback, the Roam is an outstanding portable speaker. It works over bluetooth without Wi-Fi, has a battery that lasts for 10 hours of continuous play and uses a combination of tweeters and woofers to keep sound ringing clear at any frequency and volume. Ultimate Ears Megaboom 4 for $150 (25 percent off): The UE Megaboom line is venerable at this point, dropping first in 2015, but its fourth iteration still tops our audiophile lists. It puts out 360-degree sound with an emphasis on bass, can work up to 147 feet away from the music source, and literally floats in water (though you probably shouldn't leave it in the pool all night). It can even pair with any other UE speaker through PartyUp — combining it with a couple of Wonderbooms pays off in spades. Sonos Era 100 for $169 (15 percent off): Two years after launch, the Era 100 is still a smart speaker more than worth your time. It's sleek and simply designed, making it clear Sonos's engineers put their work into sound quality and features rather than just looking the part. Touch controls have never worked better, and setup takes five minutes, though you will have to use the Sonos app. Once you start playing music, the Era 100 can get as loud as you like, while never sacrificing audio quality. Bose SoundLink Home for $179 (18 percent off): The SoundLink Home is small for a high-quality speaker, but it packs everything it needs into two pounds and about 10 square inches. Nothing about the sound is diminished thanks to two passive radiators. Though we haven't gotten to test it directly, given Bose's record with other compact speakers like the Flex, we're confident it'll be loud enough to satisfy anyone. Marshall Acton III for $180 (40 percent off): The Acton III is one of the speakers Marshall redesigned and updated in 2022, and it still sounds great today (and looks it too). It's less portable at 6.3 pounds, but can hit high volumes with little or no distortion. The upgrade angled Acton III's tweeters outward so the soundscape is wider, making this one speaker very capable of filling a room with sound on its own. Amazon Echo Studio for $190 (14 percent off): It may look a lot like the Echo Dot Max, but the Echo Studio is its own beast. It was just redesigned around Alexa+, but the fundamentals haven't changed — it's still capable of putting out immersive sound. The physical re-engineering also makes it fit better with your home decor, while the relocated light ring makes the whole device easier to interact with. Sony ULT Field 5 for $198 (43 percent off): Sony's recently rebranded ULT lineup has impressed us so far, especially their 90s-style bass boost buttons. The ULT Field 5 is a pretty traditional bluetooth speaker with a ton of options, including Party Connect to link multiple speakers together, a 10-band equalizer for finding the exact sound balance you want and even a shoulder strap that makes it way more portable. Bose TV Speaker soundbar for $199 (29 percent off): Bose's entry into the world of soundbars does not disappoint. For a price lower than some Bluetooth speakers, you'll get a compact two-foot speaker bar that amplifies dialogue while conjuring a balanced, realistic soundscape from any movie or show. It's suitable for audio neophytes, too, with no complex adjustments necessary — just plug in the HDMI and start watching. Samsung HW-B650/ZA 3.1 Channel Soundbar for $200 (50 percent off): Samsung's mid-range soundbar is pretty simple, but it does what it needs to do: pump out Dolby 3.1 with enough volume and range to make you forget you aren't in a movie theater. It's versatile, improving both music and dialogue, and keeps everything balanced. The only real drawback is that it lacks wireless connection options other than bluetooth. Ultimate Ears Everboom for $200 (26 percent off): We gave the Everboom a full review when it first dropped last year, and found it stuck to the general Ultimate Ears plan — nothing earth-shattering in the audio quality, but rugged reliability and fantastic extra features. Everboom users can connect it to the UE Boom app, which lets you control the volume remotely, use the speaker as a megaphone to make announcements, import your playlists and pair Everbooms through the PartyUp chaining feature. Best Cyber Monday speaker deals over $200 JBL Xtreme 4 for $280 (26 percent off): Xtreme is the largest and highest-end that JBL goes, and the Xtreme 4 is a luminary of the line. At 4.6 pounds, it's on the outside edge of portability, but that weight means it puts out appropriately heavy bass, along with clear treble. It's fully weatherproof and — unless it's in a completely open space — can get loud enough that all your party guests will enjoy the full effect.

Frankly, it's worth more than this, with two radiators and three transducers that make it sound larger than it is. Indoors or outdoors, it's great for anyone who wants to be able to pick out individual elements of their favorite music.

          "standfirst": "Streaming deals come and go throughout the year, but they are most abundant around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. It’s been a testy year for streaming services to say the least, and one big manifestation of that has been continuously rising prices. Disney+ and HBO Max were just a couple of the streaming services that bumped up prices, which means it’s more important than ever to subscribe if and when you can get a discount.Thankfully, a ton of streaming services are on sale for Cyber Monday. These are the best Cyber Monday streaming deals you can get this year; just note, though, that most require you to be either a new subscriber to get the deal, or a returning subscriber who hasn’t been a paid customer in a hot minute. Also, most of the offers expire at the end of the day Cyber Monday, so you only have a bit more time to decide if you want to take the plunge. Best Cyber Monday streaming deals Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Cyber Monday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live for new and eligible returning subscribers, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. This deal ends December 1. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Cyber Monday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36. This Cyber Monday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. This deal ends December 1. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Cyber Monday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. This deal ends December 2. MasterClass — up to 50 percent off annual subscriptions: The MasterClass Cyber Monday deal discounts most subscription tiers by 50 percent when you pay for one year upfront. The Premium tier, the most expensive option, usually costs $20 per month but now only sets you back $10 per month for one year. That gives you access to the entire MasterClass content library, offline viewing and up to six simultaneous streams. Audible — three months for $3 + $20 Audible credit: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. This deal ends December 1. Plex — lifetime pass for $150: Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Fubo TV — up to $30 off your first month: Fubo is arguably the best live TV streaming service for sports, and now new subscribers can save up to $30 on their first month. You'll get that discount if you subscribe to the Elite plan, which normally costs $95 per month and provides access to 325 channels including ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox, and it includes ESPN Unlimited as well. If you're looking for a more affordable plan, the News + Sports tier has a $10 discount for new subscribers. DirecTV — starting at $50/month for one month: All of DirecTV's signature packages are up to $45 off right now for your first month when you sign up. If you opt for the base \"Entertainment\" package, you'll spend $50 for the first month and get access to over 90 channels, including many local stations as well as ESPN, ESPN 2 and Fox Sports 1. You'll also be able to watch on the go with the DirecTV mobile app.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-streaming-deals-for-2025-disney-hulu-bundle-hbo-max-apple-tv-and-more-to-shop-before-the-sales-end-tonight-172013362.html?src=rss",

That makes this a good time to get your hands on a new iPad, Apple Watch or AirPods. Engadget has been reviewing Apple’s products for the past 20 years or so — this year alone saw us evaluate, among others, the latest-gen AirPods Pro, the new Apple Watches, the iPad Pro M5, the iPad Air M3 and all the new MacBooks.

Other discounts are still available at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, B&H Photo and other third-party retailers, which you'll find linked below. Apple Cyber Monday deals: AirPods AirPods 4 (no ANC) for $80 ($50 off) at Walmart: You miss out on a few more features on the base-model AirPods 4: no live translation, no noise cancellation and no heart rate sensing, but you do get Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, like on the pricer models. We gave the entry-level buds an 88 in our review. The previous low price was $69 earlier in the sale. Also available at Target. AirPods 4 (with ANC) for $99 ($80 off) at Amazon: If you just need moderate noise cancellation and prefer an open-wear fit (where nothing goes in your ear canal), you may prefer the new AirPods 4. They don’t have heart rate sensing or the hearing features the Pro models have. But we found the sound quality to be pretty good and appreciated Pro-level features like live translation. Also at Walmart and at Best Buy. EarPods for $17 ($2 off) at Amazon: For those who prefer a cord, here is the only Apple-branded wired earphone option. Also at Walmart. Apple TV Cyber Monday deal Apple Cyber Monday deals: iPads iPad mini (A17 Pro, 8-inch, 128GB) for $349 ($150 off) at Amazon: The smallest Apple iPad is really meant for those who put a priority on the portability and palm-ability of an 8-inch tablet. It uses the A17 chip, which enables support for Apple Intelligence, unlike the base model iPad. We gave it an 83 in our review, praising the fact that you get the full iPad experience, just in a more compact package. We found it particularly suited to messaging, reading, watching video and playing lots of Balatro. It went as low as $349 earlier in the sale. Also at Best Buy and it's $400 at Target and $449 at B&H. iPad (A16) for $275 ($74 off) at Target: The entry level iPad doesn’t support Apple Intelligence, but that didn’t bother us when we reviewed the new slate. We found the speed to be plenty for what most people need an iPad for: casual gaming, streaming, browsing, answering some emails. We wish the display was laminated and had some anti-glare coating. But this is the lowest-priced way to get your hands on a current-model iPad. As of this writing, the slate is going in and out of stock and right now and appears to be sold out at Amazon. Similar deals on various colors are also available at Best Buy and B&H. iPad Air (M3, 13-inch, 128GB) for $649 ($150 off) at Amazon: A larger screen will make watching shows and playing games more expansive. And if you use your iPad more like a personal computer, you’ll appreciate the extra real estate for spreading out your work. Like the 11-inch Air, this has a powerful M3 chip and an excellent screen, as well as support for the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Intelligence. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target, Best Buy and it's $729 at B&H. iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch, 256GB) for $899 ($100 off) at Amazon: While we think this is an amazing piece of computing machinery, we admit that it’s overkill for most people. It's got one of the best displays you’ll find on a tablet, the most recent M5 chip (the same that powers the base-level Apple MacBook Pro) and an almost impossibly thin and light build. We gave it an 85 in our review and had very few complaints — aside from the near-prohibitive price tag. Hopefully this Cyber Monday Friday discount helps. This $100 discount is a new all-time low. It's $927 at Walmart. iPad Pro (M5, 13-inch, 256GB) for $1,199 ($100 off) at Amazon: To get the most out of the excessive power of the M5 chip, you might want the biggest screen. Once you add in the keyboard and Pencil Pro, you’re looking at one pricey setup (and might be better off with a MacBook?). But if extreme portability and massive power is what you crave, you may as well save $100 with this Cyber Monday discount. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Apple Cyber Monday deals: Apple Watches Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS) for $199 ($49 off) at Amazon: After a couple years, Apple finally updated its budget-model smart watch. And we were pretty happy with the results, awarding the new wearable a review score of 90. It’s got a smaller screen and thicker bezels than the Series 11 and lacks a few of the more advanced health monitoring features. It’s also made from slightly less-robust materials. But it has nearly everything that makes Apple Watches great for a lot less — particularly now. This is the lowest price we've seen since the watch came out in September. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Watch Ultra 3 (49mm, GPS + cellular) for $700 ($99 off) at Amazon: The newest feature for Apple’s priciest smartwatch is satellite connectivity. The Ultra 3 has a titanium case, a large 49mm screen size and comes standard with cellular and dual GPS connectivity. It also has features for adventuring, like an on-board siren, depth gauge and up to 3,000 nits of brightness. The $99 discount within a dollar of the all-time low. Apple Cyber Monday deals: MacBooks and Macs Apple 2025 MacBook Air 13-inch Laptop with M4 chip for $749 ($250 off): As far as we’re concerned, Apple makes the best laptop overall with the M4 MacBook Air. It’s light and portable yet powerful enough to handle all but the most demanding media rendering. The keyboard and touchpad are excellent and the battery will get you through a full day of work and then some. It earned a 92 in our review. Also at Best Buy and it's $100 off at B&H. The laptop is currently listed at out of stock at Amazon, but you can still purchase it and won't be charged until it ships. Apple MacBook Air (M4, 15-inch, 256GB) for $949 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M4 chip is quite powerful, to take advantage of all the productivity it enables, you might want a little more room on your screen. When Apple first made a 15-inch option for the MacBook Air a couple generations ago, we were surprised at the difference it made. Also at Best Buy and it's $100 off at B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,349 ($249 off) at Amazon: Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,699 ($300 off) at Amazon: The M5 chip isn’t yet available in the Pro and Max variants. If Apple follows the same six-month gap that separated the M4 from the M4 Pro and Max chips, we may see the M5 Pro/Max in spring of next year. For now, however, those higher-specced chips can only be found in the M4-series lineup. The MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip is on sale and it’s our recommendation for creative professionals who need an obscene amount of processing power. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 16-inch, 256GB) for $2,149 ($350 off) at Amazon: You sacrifice a little portability for the larger 16-inch screen, as it adds about a pound and a quarter to the weight. But you might appreciate the extra space for your work on the display. Also at Walmart and B&H. Apple 2024 iMac (M4, 24-inch) for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon: Apple just has one model of an all-in-one desktop computer and it has the M4 chip inside. We called the iMac more cost effective than ever, now that it comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. The M4 chip makes it capable for content creation, productivity and gaming. Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($120 off) at Amazon: Apple’s compact desktop computer got a rave review from us. We called it \"shockingly small [and] incredibly powerful.” It also benefits from a bump to a minimum of 16GB of internal memory. It can play modern games at reasonable resolutions and handle most productivity tasks you throw at it. Apple Cyber Monday deals: Accessories Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $63 ($36 off) at Amazon: Even though they haven’t been updated in a few years, Apple’s AirTags are still the gold standard of Bluetooth trackers, and what most people think of when they think of trackers. We may get a new version soon, but they aren’t likely to be this cheap. Also at Walmart. A single AirTag is on sale too for $18 instead of $29. Apple Pencil USB-C for $69 ($10 off) at Amazon: If you have the new base-model iPad with the A16 chip, this is the pencil that will work for you. It’ll also work with current as well as slightly older models of the Air and Pro iPads. The deal has been vacillating between $49 and $69 over the shopping holiday. Apple Pencil Pro for $95 ($35 off) at Amazon: The Apple Pencil situation is a little messy, so you’ll want to double check which model is compatible with your particular iPad. The Pencil Pro is the most fully featured in the lineup with haptic feedback, barrel roll and squeeze capabilities, and a hover preview feature. It’ll work with the two most recent models of the Air and Pro iPads, as well as the latest iPad mini. The $95 price is $5 more than the all-time low and it's also available at Walmart and Best Buy.

That makes this a good time to get your hands on a new iPad, Apple Watch or AirPods.

          "standfirst": "Cyber Monday 2025 has arrived, and if you haven’t started your holiday shopping yet, now’s the time. Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals have been basically in full-swing since early November, and now most of those have become the best Cyber Monday you can get. This is the time of year to look for not just gifts for the holidays, but also for things you need for yourself, be it household essentials, shoes, and yes, new tech.Engadget can help with that last category. We’ve been tracking the best Cyber Monday deals on tech since the start of the month, and we’ve collected the best of the bunch here that are still available for Cyber Monday. As to be expected, most things are down to record-low prices, and you’ll find some of the best discounts on things like headphones, streaming devices, tech accessories and more. We expect many of these deals to be gone tomorrow, so you have only a few more hours to shop and get the discounts. These are the best Cyber Monday deals on tech you can still get right now. Cyber Monday deals: Engadget's top picks Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. Apple AirPods Pro 3 for $220 ($29 off): Apple's latest flagship wireless earbuds are the ones to get if you have an iPhone and any other Apple gear. They have improved sound quality, impressive ANC improvements, extra features like Live Translation and even better battery life. Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $349 ($150 off): Apple's smallest iPad is only a little bigger than a paperback book, and makes a good option for anyone who wants their next table to be as travel-friendly as possible. Also, if you like the feel of an e-reader, this is the iPad that mimics those devices the most. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Cyber Monday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $449 ($50 off): As of Cyber Monday, there is one actual deal on the Switch 2 that wasn't available for Black Friday. Walmart currently has the Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle for $50, bringing it down to $449. Note, though, that you must be signed into a Walmart account and add the item to your cart in order to see the discounted price. There's no telling how long this deal will last. PlayStation 5 standard edition for $449 ($100 off): The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Cyber Monday discount, with $100 off consoles. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. We're seeing some of the consoles, particularly the digital edition, go in and out of stock as of late. However, it has come back eventually at retailers like Amazon. If you see the model you want listed as out of stock, it's worth it to check back in an hour or two to see if that's changed. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. Samsung P9 microSD Express card (512GB) for $75 (25 percent off): There are only a handful of microSD Express cards on the market right now, and they are the type you need if you want to expand the storage on your new Switch 2. After testing a bunch of these cards to find the best microSD Express card for Switch 2, our biggest takeaway was that most of the ones on the market right now work well and you should get the capacity you want at the cheapest price you can find. This is a great deal on a 512GB card, and there are other Cyber Monday deals on 256GB cards, too. DJI Mic Mini wireless lav mic for $66 (45 percent off): Content creators or anyone who just needs higher quality audio in the videos they make will want a wireless microphone like the DJI Mic Mini. Its lightweight and easily attaches to almost anything via clips or magnets, and it pairs easily with smartphones and cameras via Bluetooth. You can also get a configuration that includes a charging case for $80. Sonos Arc Ultra soundbar for $879 (20 percent off): Sonos' most premium soundbar offers crisp, clear sound and an impressive bass boost over the original. It has a sleek design and works with the Sonos Ace headphones as well. There are plenty of other Sonos Cyber Monday deals to consider as well, both on Amazon and direct at Sonos. Google Pixel 10 Pro for $749 (25 percent off): You can get much better than this when it comes to Android phones. Google's latest flagship has a brighter display, longer battery life, a camera that supports 100x Pro Res Zoom and Pixelsnap (i.e. Qi2) charging support. Cyber Monday streaming deals and subscription deals Audible — three months for $3 + $20 Audible credit: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Cyber Monday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Cyber Monday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. MasterClass — up to 50 percent off annual subscriptions: The MasterClass Cyber Monday deal discounts most subscription tiers by 50 percent when you pay for one year upfront. The Premium tier, the most expensive option, usually costs $20 per month but now only sets you back $10 per month for one year. That gives you access to the entire MasterClass content library, offline viewing and up to six simultaneous streams. Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Cyber Monday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Proton VPN (24 months) for $59.76 (75 percent off): Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN — a secure, trustworthy app that doesn't sacrifice features, speed or usability. Although its free plan does come with unlimited data, we recommend upgrading to get the full set of servers and features. With this deal, you'll get servers in 117 countries; better yet, every one of those we've tested so far can unblock Netflix. Cyber Monday Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $80 ($50 off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $63 (36 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Apple Watch SE 3 for $199 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $738 ($261 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Cyber Monday deals under $50 LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants Building Toys 10349 for $18 (20 percent off): Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on a windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart; it's one of many Lego Cyber Monday deals you can get right now. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Cyber Monday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 (52 percent off): This is one of the best Roku devices to get if you're on a budget and just want to make an aging TV set feel a little bit newer. This model supports 4K HDR content, has pretty accurate universal search and gives you access to a ton of free content to watch via Roku's streaming OS. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 (35 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Best Cyber Monday deals on tech Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool heater and fan for $300 ($200 off): I've had this heater and fan for over five years at this point and it remains one of my favorite pieces of tech. It's lightweight enough to carry from room to room and it's both a heater and a fan: it cuts the chill in my home office during the winter, and circulates the air to keep me cooler in the summer. You can control the whole thing using the included remote (and it includes a sleep timer), and it handily attaches magnetically to the top of the device so you don't misplace it. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. PlayStation VR2 + Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle for $299 ($100 off): It’s hard to broadly recommend the PSVR2: The actual hardware is superb, but there aren’t a ton of standout exclusives to play. Thankfully, you can now use the device with a gaming PC through a separate adapter, though it’s all wired-only. Still, if you have cash to burn and want to dive into games like Gran Turismo 7, the Resident Evil 4 remake or the Horizon adventure bundled here, this is a new low. If this offer runs out of stock, the standalone headset is on sale for the same price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Sony PlayStation Portal for $179 at Amazon ($21 off): Included in the many Cyber Monday deals on PS5 consoles, games and accessories is this first major discount for Sony’s remote play handheld, which recently added the ability to run games directly from the cloud. Just note you need a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription for that. Anecdotally, I’ve found it a godsend as a new dad. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others. Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($900) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $170 ($80 off): The latest color ereader in Amazon's lineup includes a seven-inch, high-contrast display, USB-C charging and a battery life that can last up to eight weeks on a single charge. Its design is waterproof too, so you don't need to baby it if you take it by the pool or to the beach. If you prefer a black-and-white screen, the base Kindle is also on sale for $80. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Ninja Creami ice cream maker for $180 (22 percent off): The Creami has been one of the most sought-after kitchen appliances of the past couple of years, and for good reason. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen gear because it makes it a breeze to prepare custom ice cream and many other frozen treats. It's definitely worthwhile investment if you're an ice cream lover and want to experiment with making your own flavors. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-deals-on-tech-for-2025-the-best-sales-from-apple-amazon-lego-dyson-disney-and-others-are-up-to-50-percent-off-170028712.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Cyber Monday 2025 has arrived, and if you haven’t started your holiday shopping yet, now’s the time. Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals have been basically in full-swing since early November, and now most of those have become the best Cyber Monday you can get. This is the time of year to look for not just gifts for the holidays, but also for things you need for yourself, be it household essentials, shoes, and yes, new tech.Engadget can help with that last category. We’ve been tracking the best Cyber Monday deals on tech since the start of the month, and we’ve collected the best of the bunch here that are still available for Cyber Monday. As to be expected, most things are down to record-low prices, and you’ll find some of the best discounts on things like headphones, streaming devices, tech accessories and more. We expect many of these deals to be gone tomorrow, so you have only a few more hours to shop and get the discounts. These are the best Cyber Monday deals on tech you can still get right now. Cyber Monday deals: Engadget's top picks Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. Apple AirPods Pro 3 for $220 ($29 off): Apple's latest flagship wireless earbuds are the ones to get if you have an iPhone and any other Apple gear. They have improved sound quality, impressive ANC improvements, extra features like Live Translation and even better battery life. Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $349 ($150 off): Apple's smallest iPad is only a little bigger than a paperback book, and makes a good option for anyone who wants their next table to be as travel-friendly as possible. Also, if you like the feel of an e-reader, this is the iPad that mimics those devices the most. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Cyber Monday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $449 ($50 off): As of Cyber Monday, there is one actual deal on the Switch 2 that wasn't available for Black Friday. Walmart currently has the Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle for $50, bringing it down to $449. Note, though, that you must be signed into a Walmart account and add the item to your cart in order to see the discounted price. There's no telling how long this deal will last. PlayStation 5 standard edition for $449 ($100 off): The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Cyber Monday discount, with $100 off consoles. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. We're seeing some of the consoles, particularly the digital edition, go in and out of stock as of late. However, it has come back eventually at retailers like Amazon. If you see the model you want listed as out of stock, it's worth it to check back in an hour or two to see if that's changed. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. Samsung P9 microSD Express card (512GB) for $75 (25 percent off): There are only a handful of microSD Express cards on the market right now, and they are the type you need if you want to expand the storage on your new Switch 2. After testing a bunch of these cards to find the best microSD Express card for Switch 2, our biggest takeaway was that most of the ones on the market right now work well and you should get the capacity you want at the cheapest price you can find. This is a great deal on a 512GB card, and there are other Cyber Monday deals on 256GB cards, too. DJI Mic Mini wireless lav mic for $66 (45 percent off): Content creators or anyone who just needs higher quality audio in the videos they make will want a wireless microphone like the DJI Mic Mini. Its lightweight and easily attaches to almost anything via clips or magnets, and it pairs easily with smartphones and cameras via Bluetooth. You can also get a configuration that includes a charging case for $80. Sonos Arc Ultra soundbar for $879 (20 percent off): Sonos' most premium soundbar offers crisp, clear sound and an impressive bass boost over the original. It has a sleek design and works with the Sonos Ace headphones as well. There are plenty of other Sonos Cyber Monday deals to consider as well, both on Amazon and direct at Sonos. Google Pixel 10 Pro for $749 (25 percent off): You can get much better than this when it comes to Android phones. Google's latest flagship has a brighter display, longer battery life, a camera that supports 100x Pro Res Zoom and Pixelsnap (i.e. Qi2) charging support. Cyber Monday streaming deals and subscription deals Audible — three months for $3 + $20 Audible credit: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Cyber Monday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Cyber Monday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. MasterClass — up to 50 percent off annual subscriptions: The MasterClass Cyber Monday deal discounts most subscription tiers by 50 percent when you pay for one year upfront. The Premium tier, the most expensive option, usually costs $20 per month but now only sets you back $10 per month for one year. That gives you access to the entire MasterClass content library, offline viewing and up to six simultaneous streams. Paramount+ (2 months) for $6 ($20 off): Paramount+ is doing its Cyber Monday deal a little differently. Instead of a reasonably cheap long-term plan, you get an incredibly cheap short-term deal — two months for less than a Starbucks run costs these days. That's more than enough time to binge Yellowjackets, Dexter: Resurrection or Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, along with weeks of NFL games through CBS Sports. Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Proton VPN (24 months) for $59.76 (75 percent off): Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN — a secure, trustworthy app that doesn't sacrifice features, speed or usability. Although its free plan does come with unlimited data, we recommend upgrading to get the full set of servers and features. With this deal, you'll get servers in 117 countries; better yet, every one of those we've tested so far can unblock Netflix. Cyber Monday Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $80 ($50 off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $63 (36 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Apple Watch SE 3 for $199 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $738 ($261 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Cyber Monday deals under $50 LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants Building Toys 10349 for $18 (20 percent off): Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on a windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart; it's one of many Lego Cyber Monday deals you can get right now. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Cyber Monday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 (52 percent off): This is one of the best Roku devices to get if you're on a budget and just want to make an aging TV set feel a little bit newer. This model supports 4K HDR content, has pretty accurate universal search and gives you access to a ton of free content to watch via Roku's streaming OS. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 (35 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Best Cyber Monday deals on tech Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool heater and fan for $300 ($200 off): I've had this heater and fan for over five years at this point and it remains one of my favorite pieces of tech. It's lightweight enough to carry from room to room and it's both a heater and a fan: it cuts the chill in my home office during the winter, and circulates the air to keep me cooler in the summer.

Still, if you have cash to burn and want to dive into games like Gran Turismo 7, the Resident Evil 4 remake or the Horizon adventure bundled here, this is a new low.

Just note you need a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription for that. Anecdotally, I’ve found it a godsend as a new dad. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others. Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $398 ($402 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($900) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete.

          "standfirst": "If you’ve been looking to add more games to your backlog, grab a new console or pick up some accessories for your gaming PC, this year’s Cyber Monday sales have been a good opportunity to do so. To help you avoid wasting your cash, we’ve dug through reviews, checked price histories and sorted out the best Cyber Monday gaming deals we could find. So far we’ve seen a surprise $50 drop for the Nintendo Switch 2, PS5 consoles for $100 off, all-time lows for tons of Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox and PC games and notable price drops on various mice, keyboards and headsets we like. Cyber Monday game console deals Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World for $449 at Best Buy ($50 off MSRP): This is the first widely available discount we’ve seen for Nintendo’s latest hybrid console. For reference, Nintendo normally sells this bundle with the kart racer Mario Kart World for $499, but the game retails for $80 on its own. You should see the deal once you add the console to your cart. Also at Amazon and Walmart, though you may need to be signed into a Walmart account to see the offer at the latter. Sony PlayStation 5 for $449 at Amazon ($101 off): It’s hard to get super excited about a PS5 deal like this after Sony’s price hikes earlier this year, but steeper discounts on the console have still been fairly uncommon. Alternatively, you can grab an NBA 2K26 bundle or one with various Fortnite goodies for $1 more. A special Ghost of Yotei edition, meanwhile, is also $100 off at $499. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony PlayStation 5 Digital Edition for $399 at Amazon ($101 off): The disc-less version of the PS5 actually launched for $399 five years ago, but in 2025, that price now counts as a deal. A Fortnite bundle is available for the same price. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony PlayStation 5 Pro for $649 at Amazon ($101 off): Most people don’t need the PS5 Pro, but this discount still ties the lowest price we’ve seen for Sony’s most powerful console. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Cyber Monday Nintendo Switch deals Samsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2 (256GB) for $39 at Amazon ($20 off): The only reason to buy a super-fast (and pricey) microSD Express card is to expand the storage of a Nintendo Switch 2, which requires the newer format. In our guide to the best Switch 2 microSD cards, we found each model we tested to perform similarly in actual games, so your best bet is to buy whichever one you can find in stock at the lowest price. For Cyber Monday, that’s Samsung’s officially licensed card, provided you can live with 256GB of space. This discount marks a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Samsung P9 Express microSD Express Card (512GB) for $75 at Amazon ($25 off): If you need even more room for your Switch 2, this is a new low for the 512GB version of Samsung’s newest microSD Express card. Full disclosure: Samsung launched this card a couple of weeks ago, and we only just got it in for testing. But given the trend of similar Switch 2 performance we’ve seen with other Express cards thus far, and the fact that this is easily the cheapest 512GB model we can find in stock as of this writing, we figure it’s worth noting. Also at Samsung. Lexar Play Pro (1TB) microSD Express card for $186 at Amazon ($34 off): If you want the most space possible for Nintendo's new console, the Play Pro is one of the few microSD Express cards available in a 1TB capacity. This is the second-best price we've seen for that card since July, so it's not an amazing deal, but it is the cheapest 1TB model we can find from a reliable brand right now. Cyber Monday PS5 deals Sony PlayStation Portal for $179 at Amazon ($21 off): This is the first major discount for Sony’s remote play handheld, which recently added the ability to run games directly from the cloud. Just note you need a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription for that. Anecdotally, I’ve found it a godsend as a new dad. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others. Sony DualSense controller for $55 at Amazon ($20 off): Here’s a nice chance to save if you’ve been meaning to stock up on new gamepads for your PS5 (or PC). Several colorways are on sale, though some cost $5 to $10 extra. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony DualSense Edge controller for $169 at Amazon ($31 off): Sony’s “pro” PS5 controller adds customizable back buttons, swappable thumbstick modules, trigger stops and the ability to set custom button mappings and sensitivities. We found it to have worse battery life than the standard DualSense, though, typically lasting just five to six hours. We saw it fall to $160 earlier this week, but this is still a noteworthy chance to save. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others. PlayStation Plus Premium (12-month) for $107 at PlayStation ($53 off): Sony’s online service has only gotten pricier over the years, but this is still a rare chance to save on annual subscriptions. A Premium membership gets you cloud streaming support and an on-demand library of retro games on top of the perks included with the lower PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Essential tiers. A 12-month Extra subscription is also on sale for $101, though at that price you might as well go all the way. Just remember that your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default. The offers apply to new and select existing customers; for the latter, the exact discount will depend on how much time you have left on your current membership. Sadly, there doesn’t appear to be any deal for the standard Essential tier. PlayStation 5 Access Controller for $70 at Amazon ($20 off): The Access Controller is a circular, customizable PS5 pad that’s designed for players with accessibility needs. This isn’t the device’s best discount ever — it went as low as $49 over the summer — but it’s still a nice drop from its usual street price. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Astro Bot for $40 at Best Buy ($20 off): Here’s the largest widely available discount to date for this wonderfully inventive 3D platformer, which Engadget’s Jess Conditt called “one of the best games Sony has ever made” in her review. Also at Amazon and PlayStation. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach for $50 at Amazon ($20 off): The latest adventure from Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima, Death Stranding 2 is both a fascinating delivery sim fixated on how we physically interact with the world and an indulgent melodrama you’ll either find endearing or unbearable. Either way, there really isn’t another game like it. This discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Helldivers 2 for $30 at Best Buy ($10 off): This ties the best price we’ve tracked for the PS5 copy of the raucous co-op shooter Helldivers 2, which straddles the line between Starship Troopers-esque satire and engaging strategic action. Also at Amazon and Target. If you’d rather play on PC, Steam has it for $2 extra. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for $30 at Amazon ($20 off): Engadget’s Mat Smith gave this grandiose action-RPG a favorable review last year. You need to play its predecessor — and ideally, the original PS1 game — to get the most out of it, but it’s stuffed with things to do, and its combat system is still a tactical rush at its best. This is its all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. God of War Ragnarök for $20 at Best Buy ($50 off): Ragnarök is another PlayStation “prestige” sequel that’s more about upping the scope than truly reinventing itself, but its Norse world is beautifully detailed and smashing baddies with a magic axe always feels great. This matches the all-time low for the PS5 version. Also at Target and PlayStation. Sony has discounted a ton more first-party PS5 games for Black Friday and Cyber Monday beyond that. Highlights include the open-world adventures Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered and Horizon Forbidden West for $20 each, while Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Gran Turismo 7, The Last of Us Part I, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut and Demon’s Souls are all $30 apiece. Cyber Monday Xbox deals Xbox Wireless Controller for $40 at Amazon ($25 off): To be candid, Xbox’s holiday deal selection is fairly weak: Neither the Xbox Series X nor Series S are on sale, and the brand doesn’t do exclusive games anymore. (You can still find a bunch of Xbox game deals below, though.) If you want to grab a spare controller, however, this is a nice chance to save after Microsoft’s price hike earlier this year. Several color options are discounted, though some are priced $5 to $10 higher. Also at Best Buy, Xbox and others. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($60 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to a new Xbox is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only a couple of those exist, and they’re all pricey, but this deal for Seagate’s 2TB card is about $20 off the device's usual street price as of late. The 4TB variant is also on sale for $380, which matches its best-ever price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Cyber Monday video game deals Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 for $40 at PlayStation ($10 off): The frontrunner for 2025's consensus Game of the Year, Clair Obscur is a gorgeous RPG with turn-based combat that actually feels dangerous and a bold story that examines the margins between grief and escapism. Engadget’s Mat Smith called it a “beautiful game” in his review. While not a huge discount, this is a new low for the PS5 version. Also at Humble if you’d rather play on PC. Split Fiction for $40 at Amazon ($10 off): A pick from our guide to the best couch co-op games, Split Fiction overcomes some hacky writing with brisk action, a lighthearted tone and a Nintendo-like committing to presenting new level ideas. We saw it fall as low as $30 last week, but this is a useful $10 discount all the same. Also at Best Buy, PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II for $30 at GameStop ($30 off): Another one of the year’s highest-rated games, this systems-heavy action-RPG is something of an acquired taste, but it takes the “role-playing” bit more seriously than most of its peers. This is an all-time low for the PS5 version and $5 off the Xbox copy’s best price. Also at Humble for $36 if you want to play on PC and at Best Buy for $40. Silent Hill f for $50 at Amazon ($20 off): It takes a bit to get going, but this newest installment in the long-running psychological horror series is surprisingly layered on top of being good for some unnerving scares. This is a new low. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds for $40 at Amazon ($30 off): Mario Kart World may be the year’s most famous kart racer, but CrossWorlds is a fine alternative with a greater sense of speed, more customization options and less overall restraint. This deal is $10 more than the all-time low we saw last week, but it's still a decent drop. Doom: The Dark Ages for $35 at PlayStation ($35 off): The most recent installment in the celebrated FPS series, The Dark Ages takes a meatier and more grounded approach to combat than the frantic Doom Eternal. It also has you pilot an armor-coated dragon sometimes. Engadget’s Jess Conditt called it “a well-rounded romp through the bowels of hell” in her review. This is a new low for the PlayStation and Xbox editions. Also at Steam. Elden Ring for $20 at Amazon ($35 off): The action-RPG Elden Ring is both challenging and darkly funny, with a world that runs incredibly deep and feels lived-in (died-in) in a way few games have. This deal is $5 higher than the all-time low we saw on Black Friday but still cheaper than the game's usual going rate. Also at GameStop. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle for $49 at PlayStation ($21 off): Few licensed games do a better job of capturing the spirit of their source material than Great Circle, a first-person adventure that wisely focuses on puzzle-solving and exploration over combat. A rollicking, well-paced story and tremendous voice acting round it out. This is a new low for the PS5 and Xbox versions. Also at Steam, though it’s been slightly cheaper on PC before. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition for $39 at Steam ($44 off): The moody Cyberpunk 2077 started as a technical disaster but now stands as a perfectly solid action-RPG, one bolstered by its pointed narrative and striking techno-future art style. This ties the best price we’ve seen for the PC version of the Ultimate Edition, which includes the game’s well-regarded Phantom Liberty DLC. Also at Xbox for $40 and PlayStation for $43. Returnal for $23 at Steam ($37 off): This third-person shooter roguelike is at once a technical showcase, a stiff test and an achingly beautiful reflection on the nature of grief. It’s also worth checking out if you’re eager to play developer Housemarque’s next game, Saros, which looks to borrow many elements introduced here. This deal is for the PC version; the PS5 copy is also on sale for $30 at Amazon, PlayStation, Best Buy and others. Halo: The Master Chief Collection for $10 at Steam ($30 off): We’ve seen this deal a bunch of times over the years, but it matches the lowest-ever price for The Master Chief Collection, which gathers six of the venerable FPS series’ games in one package. Also at Xbox. Thank Goodness You’re Here! for $12 at PlayStation ($8 off): Thank Goodness You’re Here! is a delightfully clever and exceedingly British comedy game about a little yellow man who does everything requested of him to an increasingly surreal extent. It’s three hours long and, as Engadget’s Mat Smith wrote in his review, all Actually Funny. The ending alone is worth this price, which ties the game’s all-time low. Also at Steam. Pentiment for $10 at Xbox ($10 off): One of the Xbox’s true gems, Pentiment is an unusually soulful 2D adventure/visual novel that does nothing less than scrutinize the nature of truth. It’s also very pretty. This deal ties the game’s all-time low. Also at Steam. Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon for $20 at Amazon ($10 off): Armored Core VI is a loud action game about building a mech and using it to blow up everything in sight. It’s as awesome as that sounds, and it feels great, but its formidable bosses and deep customization options keeps it from being mindless. This discount ties the best price yet for the PS5 and Xbox editions. Metaphor: ReFantazio for $20 at Woot ($50 off): It’s about as subtle as you’d expect a game named “Metaphor” to be, but the latest title from the minds behind Persona 5 is a fantasy JRPG through and through: bombastic, stylish and earnest. (And long.) This deal from Amazon-owned Woot is the best price we’ve tracked for the Xbox version. The PS5 copy is at an all-time low at several retailers, too, but that only brings it down to $33. Also at Steam for $35. Grand Theft Auto IV for $7 at Xbox ($13 off): Perhaps the most underrated GTA game, the 17-year-old GTA IV is still worth revisiting today thanks to its grimy depiction of city living and empathetic (if vulgar) story about the cracks in the American dream. Maybe just ignore the incessant calls to go bowling. This deal matches the game’s all-time low. Cyber Monday gaming handheld deals Lenovo Legion Go S (SteamOS, Ryzen Z1 Extreme) for $650 at Best Buy ($250 off): A top pick from our guide to the best gaming handhelds, the Legion Go S is sort like a “Steam Deck 1.5” with a larger screen, faster chipset, higher refresh rate and the same SteamOS software. It’s also much more expensive, but this discount helps lessen that. It’s a new low for the version with AMD’s Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip. Also at Lenovo. Retroid Pocket Flip 2 for $194 at Retroid ($15 off): Another recommendation from our gaming handhelds guide, the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is an Android device designed to emulate retro games. Getting those emulators set up takes some serious legwork, but this model can run games up to the PlayStation 2 and GameCube era without major issues, while its clamshell design and OLED display impress for a handheld in the $200 range. Use the code BFCM$15 to see this discount at checkout, but keep in mind that the price doesn’t include any extra shipping fees. Retroid Pocket 5 for $184 at Retroid ($15 off): You can use the same code above to get this deal for the Retroid Pocket 5, which is essentially the Flip 2 in a Sony PSP-style shape. It’s currently the top retro handheld pick in our guide and remains excellent for emulating up to the PS2 and GameCube, but it’s worth noting that Retroid recently released a new Pocket G2 model that puts a stronger chip in the same design. We haven’t tested that one yet, but it should be better if you want to emulate select PC or Switch 1 games. That one is now on sale for $204. Looming over both devices, however, is the Retroid Pocket 6, which will ship in January and looks to be a slightly more substantial upgrade. Cyber Monday VR headset deals Meta Quest 3S (128GB) + $50 Amazon credit for $250 at Amazon ($100 off): This matches the best widely available discount we’ve seen for the budget pick in our guide to the best VR headsets. At Amazon and Best Buy, you'll get a $50 credit with your purchase. PlayStation VR2 + Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle for $299 at Amazon ($100 off): It’s hard to broadly recommend the PSVR2: The actual hardware is superb, but there aren’t a ton of standout exclusives to play. Thankfully, you can now use the device with a gaming PC through a separate adapter, though it’s all wired-only. Still, if you have cash to burn and want to dive into games like Gran Turismo 7, the Resident Evil 4 remake or the Horizon adventure bundled here, this is a new low. If this offer runs out of stock, the standalone headset is on sale for the same price. Also at Best Buy, PlayStation and others. Cyber Monday gaming keyboard deals Lemokey P1 HE for $134 at Amazon ($36 off): The P1 HE is an honorable mention in our guide to the best gaming keyboards. It pairs a premium aluminum design with a fantastic typing feel and magnetic switches that let you customize the sensitivity of each press. The latter can be especially useful for competitive-style games. Its software is a pain, though. This deal marks the best price we’ve seen, but it’s only for Amazon Prime members. Everyone else can grab it at Keychron (Lemokey’s parent brand) for $136. ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless for $130 at Amazon ($80 off): If the Lemokey P1 HE runs out of stock, or if you want something closer to a full-size layout, the ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless is another wireless mechanical keyboard we like. It makes typing feel and sound lovely, though it can’t do any of the Hall effect customizations of the top picks in our guide. This deal ties an all-time low. Also at Best Buy and ASUS. Sony Inzone KBD-H75 for $278 at Amazon ($22 off): As we note in our gaming keyboard guide, the Inzone KBD-H75 ticks just about all of the boxes: a high-quality frame, versatile magnetic switches that feel and sound even nicer than our top pick, crisp PBT keycaps, decent software, even a volume knob. Its only real issue is that it’s way too expensive for a wired keyboard. It still is after this discount, but if you’ve got cash to burn, this matches the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Sony. NuPhy Air75 V2 for $84 at NuPhy ($36 off): If you’re looking for a slimmer low-profile keyboard that still uses satisfying mechanical switches, the NuPhy Air75 V2 is an older but still great option we’ve recommended in the past. This is the lowest price we’ve seen, though certain switch options are available for a few bucks more. The newer Air75 V3 is also on sale for $128; we haven’t fully reviewed that one yet, but it should offer a more bouncy typing experience with superior sound dampening. Cyber Monday gaming mouse deals Razer Viper V3 Pro for $130 at Amazon ($30 off): The Viper V3 Pro is the top pick in our guide to the best gaming mice for those who prefer a symmetrical shape. Its sturdy design is comfortable for a wide range of hand sizes and grip types, it performs just about flawlessly in competitive-style games and it’s ultra-lightweight without having any debris-collecting holes in its outer shell. This is the lowest price we’ve seen in several months. Also at Best Buy. Razer DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed for $70 at Amazon ($30 off): The DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed is a midrange option we recommend in our guide if you prefer a more ergonomic shape. Its contoured design is ideal for small- to medium-sized hands, it tracks reliably and at 55 grams it’s easy to flick around in fast-paced games. This deal marks a new low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Razer Basilisk V3 for $29 at Amazon ($17 off): If you don’t mind using a cable, the Basilisk V3 is another ergonomic model we highlight in our buying guide. It’s relatively heavy and bulky but very much comfortable for larger hands, with an impressively versatile scroll wheel that can tilt side-to-side and switch between notched and free-spin modes. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked. The wireless Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed is also on sale for $38, though that one has a more limited scroll wheel and trades the wired version’s optical clicks for less durable mechanical switches. Also at Target for $35. Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite for $50 at Best Buy ($40 off): We consider the Scimitar RGB Elite to be the best value mouse for MMO and MOBA players, as it comes with 12 programmable side buttons that make it easier to pull off complex commands in games like Final Fantasy XIV or World of Warcraft. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked in the past year. A newer wireless variant called the Scimitar Elite Wireless SE is also on sale for $75, which is a new low. Also at Corsair. Pulsar X2 CrazyLight for $91 at Amazon ($39 off): The aptly-named X2 CrazyLight is an honorable mention in our buying guide for those who mainly play twitchy shooter games and use a claw or fingertip grip, as its compact design weighs a mere 37 grams. This is the lowest price we’ve seen, and the discount applies to several colorways. Pulsar Xlite V4 for $50 at Pulsar ($50 off): The Xlite V4 is another honorable mention in our guide if you’re after a light, comfortable and responsive mouse with an ergonomic shape. The downside is it has cutouts on the bottom, which leaves the interior exposed to dust and debris. We actually tested the older Xlite V3, but the V4 is a very minor refresh that’s currently available for the same price, so it’s worth grabbing instead. The mini version is available with the same discount. Cyber Monday gaming headset deals Turtle Beach Atlas Air for $130 at Amazon ($50 off): The Atlas Air is the top pick in our guide to the best gaming headsets and one of the few wireless pairs with an open-back design. That gives it a far more spacious and immersive sound than most of its closed-back peers. It’s highly comfortable too, though it can’t block much outside noise, nor can it connect to Xbox consoles wirelessly. While not an all-time low, this is the best price we’ve seen since February. Also at Best Buy and Turtle Beach. HyperX Cloud Stinger 2 for $30 at Amazon ($20 off): The wired Cloud Stinger 2 is the budget pick in our gaming headset buying guide. It’s comfy, with a solid mic and full-bodied bass. Just don’t expect the most accurate sound or highest-quality materials at this price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Astro A50 X for $320 at Amazon ($80 off): The A50 X is a higher-end wireless headset we recommend in our guide for those who game across PS5, Xbox and PC. Its included charging station doubles as an HDMI switcher, allowing you to swap between different three different sources with the press of a button. An excellent mic and mostly balanced sound profile help as well. This deal isn’t an all-time low but still takes a good chunk off the headset’s normal going rate. Also at Best Buy and Logitech. Logitech G Pro X 2 Lightspeed for $210 at Amazon ($70 off): We call the G Pro X 2 Lightspeed a quality alternative to the Audeze Maxwell — our favorite closed-back wireless headset — in our buying guide when it’s on sale for significantly less. That’s the case right now, as this discount drops the headset to its best price since July. Also at Best Buy and Logitech. Fractal Design Scape for $140 at Amazon ($60 off): The Fractal Scape is another closed-back headset worth considering thanks to its clean sound quality, convenient magnetic charging dock and more understated design than most options in this market. Engadget’s Igor Bonifacic called it “an excellent all-around package” in his review. The built-in mic could be better, though. This deal represents a new low. Also at B&H. Sony PlayStation Pulse Elite for $129 at Amazon ($21 off): It’s not a top pick in our guide, but the Pulse Elite is a decent wireless option for PS5 owners since it lets you adjust the EQ curve and access other settings directly from the console’s UI. It can also pair to a second device simultaneously over Bluetooth. The flimsy space-age design and poor noise isolation aren’t ideal, however. This deal comes within a dollar of the headset’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-cyber-monday-gaming-deals-for-2025-save-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-ps5-consoles-xbox-controllers-tons-of-games-and-more-172904924.html?src=rss",
          "content": "If you’ve been looking to add more games to your backlog, grab a new console or pick up some accessories for your gaming PC, this year’s Cyber Monday sales have been a good opportunity to do so. To help you avoid wasting your cash, we’ve dug through reviews, checked price histories and sorted out the best Cyber Monday gaming deals we could find. So far we’ve seen a surprise $50 drop for the Nintendo Switch 2, PS5 consoles for $100 off, all-time lows for tons of Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox and PC games and notable price drops on various mice, keyboards and headsets we like. Cyber Monday game console deals Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World for $449 at Best Buy ($50 off MSRP): This is the first widely available discount we’ve seen for Nintendo’s latest hybrid console. For reference, Nintendo normally sells this bundle with the kart racer Mario Kart World for $499, but the game retails for $80 on its own. You should see the deal once you add the console to your cart. Also at Amazon and Walmart, though you may need to be signed into a Walmart account to see the offer at the latter. Sony PlayStation 5 for $449 at Amazon ($101 off): It’s hard to get super excited about a PS5 deal like this after Sony’s price hikes earlier this year, but steeper discounts on the console have still been fairly uncommon. Alternatively, you can grab an NBA 2K26 bundle or one with various Fortnite goodies for $1 more. A special Ghost of Yotei edition, meanwhile, is also $100 off at $499. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony PlayStation 5 Digital Edition for $399 at Amazon ($101 off): The disc-less version of the PS5 actually launched for $399 five years ago, but in 2025, that price now counts as a deal. A Fortnite bundle is available for the same price. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony PlayStation 5 Pro for $649 at Amazon ($101 off): Most people don’t need the PS5 Pro, but this discount still ties the lowest price we’ve seen for Sony’s most powerful console. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Cyber Monday Nintendo Switch deals Samsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2 (256GB) for $39 at Amazon ($20 off): The only reason to buy a super-fast (and pricey) microSD Express card is to expand the storage of a Nintendo Switch 2, which requires the newer format. In our guide to the best Switch 2 microSD cards, we found each model we tested to perform similarly in actual games, so your best bet is to buy whichever one you can find in stock at the lowest price. For Cyber Monday, that’s Samsung’s officially licensed card, provided you can live with 256GB of space. This discount marks a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Samsung P9 Express microSD Express Card (512GB) for $75 at Amazon ($25 off): If you need even more room for your Switch 2, this is a new low for the 512GB version of Samsung’s newest microSD Express card. Full disclosure: Samsung launched this card a couple of weeks ago, and we only just got it in for testing. But given the trend of similar Switch 2 performance we’ve seen with other Express cards thus far, and the fact that this is easily the cheapest 512GB model we can find in stock as of this writing, we figure it’s worth noting. Also at Samsung. Lexar Play Pro (1TB) microSD Express card for $186 at Amazon ($34 off): If you want the most space possible for Nintendo's new console, the Play Pro is one of the few microSD Express cards available in a 1TB capacity. This is the second-best price we've seen for that card since July, so it's not an amazing deal, but it is the cheapest 1TB model we can find from a reliable brand right now. Cyber Monday PS5 deals Sony PlayStation Portal for $179 at Amazon ($21 off): This is the first major discount for Sony’s remote play handheld, which recently added the ability to run games directly from the cloud. Just note you need a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription for that. Anecdotally, I’ve found it a godsend as a new dad. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others. Sony DualSense controller for $55 at Amazon ($20 off): Here’s a nice chance to save if you’ve been meaning to stock up on new gamepads for your PS5 (or PC). Several colorways are on sale, though some cost $5 to $10 extra. Also at Best Buy, Walmart, PlayStation and others. Sony DualSense Edge controller for $169 at Amazon ($31 off): Sony’s “pro” PS5 controller adds customizable back buttons, swappable thumbstick modules, trigger stops and the ability to set custom button mappings and sensitivities. We found it to have worse battery life than the standard DualSense, though, typically lasting just five to six hours. We saw it fall to $160 earlier this week, but this is still a noteworthy chance to save. Also at Best Buy, Walmart and others. PlayStation Plus Premium (12-month) for $107 at PlayStation ($53 off): Sony’s online service has only gotten pricier over the years, but this is still a rare chance to save on annual subscriptions. A Premium membership gets you cloud streaming support and an on-demand library of retro games on top of the perks included with the lower PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Essential tiers. A 12-month Extra subscription is also on sale for $101, though at that price you might as well go all the way. Just remember that your subscription will be set to auto-renew by default. The offers apply to new and select existing customers; for the latter, the exact discount will depend on how much time you have left on your current membership. Sadly, there doesn’t appear to be any deal for the standard Essential tier. PlayStation 5 Access Controller for $70 at Amazon ($20 off): The Access Controller is a circular, customizable PS5 pad that’s designed for players with accessibility needs. This isn’t the device’s best discount ever — it went as low as $49 over the summer — but it’s still a nice drop from its usual street price. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Astro Bot for $40 at Best Buy ($20 off): Here’s the largest widely available discount to date for this wonderfully inventive 3D platformer, which Engadget’s Jess Conditt called “one of the best games Sony has ever made” in her review. Also at Amazon and PlayStation. Death Stranding 2: On the Beach for $50 at Amazon ($20 off): The latest adventure from Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima, Death Stranding 2 is both a fascinating delivery sim fixated on how we physically interact with the world and an indulgent melodrama you’ll either find endearing or unbearable. Either way, there really isn’t another game like it. This discount matches the lowest price we’ve seen. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Helldivers 2 for $30 at Best Buy ($10 off): This ties the best price we’ve tracked for the PS5 copy of the raucous co-op shooter Helldivers 2, which straddles the line between Starship Troopers-esque satire and engaging strategic action. Also at Amazon and Target. If you’d rather play on PC, Steam has it for $2 extra. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth for $30 at Amazon ($20 off): Engadget’s Mat Smith gave this grandiose action-RPG a favorable review last year. You need to play its predecessor — and ideally, the original PS1 game — to get the most out of it, but it’s stuffed with things to do, and its combat system is still a tactical rush at its best. This is its all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. God of War Ragnarök for $20 at Best Buy ($50 off): Ragnarök is another PlayStation “prestige” sequel that’s more about upping the scope than truly reinventing itself, but its Norse world is beautifully detailed and smashing baddies with a magic axe always feels great. This matches the all-time low for the PS5 version. Also at Target and PlayStation. Sony has discounted a ton more first-party PS5 games for Black Friday and Cyber Monday beyond that. Highlights include the open-world adventures Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered and Horizon Forbidden West for $20 each, while Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Gran Turismo 7, The Last of Us Part I, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart, Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut and Demon’s Souls are all $30 apiece. Cyber Monday Xbox deals Xbox Wireless Controller for $40 at Amazon ($25 off): To be candid, Xbox’s holiday deal selection is fairly weak: Neither the Xbox Series X nor Series S are on sale, and the brand doesn’t do exclusive games anymore. (You can still find a bunch of Xbox game deals below, though.) If you want to grab a spare controller, however, this is a nice chance to save after Microsoft’s price hike earlier this year. Several color options are discounted, though some are priced $5 to $10 higher. Also at Best Buy, Xbox and others. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($60 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to a new Xbox is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only a couple of those exist, and they’re all pricey, but this deal for Seagate’s 2TB card is about $20 off the device's usual street price as of late. The 4TB variant is also on sale for $380, which matches its best-ever price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Cyber Monday video game deals Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 for $40 at PlayStation ($10 off): The frontrunner for 2025's consensus Game of the Year, Clair Obscur is a gorgeous RPG with turn-based combat that actually feels dangerous and a bold story that examines the margins between grief and escapism. Engadget’s Mat Smith called it a “beautiful game” in his review. While not a huge discount, this is a new low for the PS5 version. Also at Humble if you’d rather play on PC. Split Fiction for $40 at Amazon ($10 off): A pick from our guide to the best couch co-op games, Split Fiction overcomes some hacky writing with brisk action, a lighthearted tone and a Nintendo-like committing to presenting new level ideas. We saw it fall as low as $30 last week, but this is a useful $10 discount all the same. Also at Best Buy, PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II for $30 at GameStop ($30 off): Another one of the year’s highest-rated games, this systems-heavy action-RPG is something of an acquired taste, but it takes the “role-playing” bit more seriously than most of its peers. This is an all-time low for the PS5 version and $5 off the Xbox copy’s best price. Also at Humble for $36 if you want to play on PC and at Best Buy for $40. Silent Hill f for $50 at Amazon ($20 off): It takes a bit to get going, but this newest installment in the long-running psychological horror series is surprisingly layered on top of being good for some unnerving scares. This is a new low. Also at Best Buy and PlayStation. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds for $40 at Amazon ($30 off): Mario Kart World may be the year’s most famous kart racer, but CrossWorlds is a fine alternative with a greater sense of speed, more customization options and less overall restraint. This deal is $10 more than the all-time low we saw last week, but it's still a decent drop. Doom: The Dark Ages for $35 at PlayStation ($35 off): The most recent installment in the celebrated FPS series, The Dark Ages takes a meatier and more grounded approach to combat than the frantic Doom Eternal. It also has you pilot an armor-coated dragon sometimes. Engadget’s Jess Conditt called it “a well-rounded romp through the bowels of hell” in her review. This is a new low for the PlayStation and Xbox editions. Also at Steam. Elden Ring for $20 at Amazon ($35 off): The action-RPG Elden Ring is both challenging and darkly funny, with a world that runs incredibly deep and feels lived-in (died-in) in a way few games have. This deal is $5 higher than the all-time low we saw on Black Friday but still cheaper than the game's usual going rate. Also at GameStop. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle for $49 at PlayStation ($21 off): Few licensed games do a better job of capturing the spirit of their source material than Great Circle, a first-person adventure that wisely focuses on puzzle-solving and exploration over combat. A rollicking, well-paced story and tremendous voice acting round it out. This is a new low for the PS5 and Xbox versions. Also at Steam, though it’s been slightly cheaper on PC before. Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition for $39 at Steam ($44 off): The moody Cyberpunk 2077 started as a technical disaster but now stands as a perfectly solid action-RPG, one bolstered by its pointed narrative and striking techno-future art style. This ties the best price we’ve seen for the PC version of the Ultimate Edition, which includes the game’s well-regarded Phantom Liberty DLC. Also at Xbox for $40 and PlayStation for $43. Returnal for $23 at Steam ($37 off): This third-person shooter roguelike is at once a technical showcase, a stiff test and an achingly beautiful reflection on the nature of grief. It’s also worth checking out if you’re eager to play developer Housemarque’s next game, Saros, which looks to borrow many elements introduced here. This deal is for the PC version; the PS5 copy is also on sale for $30 at Amazon, PlayStation, Best Buy and others. Halo: The Master Chief Collection for $10 at Steam ($30 off): We’ve seen this deal a bunch of times over the years, but it matches the lowest-ever price for The Master Chief Collection, which gathers six of the venerable FPS series’ games in one package. Also at Xbox. Thank Goodness You’re Here! for $12 at PlayStation ($8 off): Thank Goodness You’re Here! is a delightfully clever and exceedingly British comedy game about a little yellow man who does everything requested of him to an increasingly surreal extent. It’s three hours long and, as Engadget’s Mat Smith wrote in his review, all Actually Funny. The ending alone is worth this price, which ties the game’s all-time low. Also at Steam. Pentiment for $10 at Xbox ($10 off): One of the Xbox’s true gems, Pentiment is an unusually soulful 2D adventure/visual novel that does nothing less than scrutinize the nature of truth. It’s also very pretty. This deal ties the game’s all-time low. Also at Steam. Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon for $20 at Amazon ($10 off): Armored Core VI is a loud action game about building a mech and using it to blow up everything in sight. It’s as awesome as that sounds, and it feels great, but its formidable bosses and deep customization options keeps it from being mindless. This discount ties the best price yet for the PS5 and Xbox editions. Metaphor: ReFantazio for $20 at Woot ($50 off): It’s about as subtle as you’d expect a game named “Metaphor” to be, but the latest title from the minds behind Persona 5 is a fantasy JRPG through and through: bombastic, stylish and earnest. (And long.) This deal from Amazon-owned Woot is the best price we’ve tracked for the Xbox version. The PS5 copy is at an all-time low at several retailers, too, but that only brings it down to $33. Also at Steam for $35. Grand Theft Auto IV for $7 at Xbox ($13 off): Perhaps the most underrated GTA game, the 17-year-old GTA IV is still worth revisiting today thanks to its grimy depiction of city living and empathetic (if vulgar) story about the cracks in the American dream. Maybe just ignore the incessant calls to go bowling. This deal matches the game’s all-time low. Cyber Monday gaming handheld deals Lenovo Legion Go S (SteamOS, Ryzen Z1 Extreme) for $650 at Best Buy ($250 off): A top pick from our guide to the best gaming handhelds, the Legion Go S is sort like a “Steam Deck 1.5” with a larger screen, faster chipset, higher refresh rate and the same SteamOS software. It’s also much more expensive, but this discount helps lessen that. It’s a new low for the version with AMD’s Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip. Also at Lenovo. Retroid Pocket Flip 2 for $194 at Retroid ($15 off): Another recommendation from our gaming handhelds guide, the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is an Android device designed to emulate retro games. Getting those emulators set up takes some serious legwork, but this model can run games up to the PlayStation 2 and GameCube era without major issues, while its clamshell design and OLED display impress for a handheld in the $200 range. Use the code BFCM$15 to see this discount at checkout, but keep in mind that the price doesn’t include any extra shipping fees. Retroid Pocket 5 for $184 at Retroid ($15 off): You can use the same code above to get this deal for the Retroid Pocket 5, which is essentially the Flip 2 in a Sony PSP-style shape. It’s currently the top retro handheld pick in our guide and remains excellent for emulating up to the PS2 and GameCube, but it’s worth noting that Retroid recently released a new Pocket G2 model that puts a stronger chip in the same design. We haven’t tested that one yet, but it should be better if you want to emulate select PC or Switch 1 games. That one is now on sale for $204. Looming over both devices, however, is the Retroid Pocket 6, which will ship in January and looks to be a slightly more substantial upgrade. Cyber Monday VR headset deals Meta Quest 3S (128GB) + $50 Amazon credit for $250 at Amazon ($100 off): This matches the best widely available discount we’ve seen for the budget pick in our guide to the best VR headsets. At Amazon and Best Buy, you'll get a $50 credit with your purchase. PlayStation VR2 + Horizon Call of the Mountain bundle for $299 at Amazon ($100 off): It’s hard to broadly recommend the PSVR2: The actual hardware is superb, but there aren’t a ton of standout exclusives to play. Thankfully, you can now use the device with a gaming PC through a separate adapter, though it’s all wired-only. Still, if you have cash to burn and want to dive into games like Gran Turismo 7, the Resident Evil 4 remake or the Horizon adventure bundled here, this is a new low. If this offer runs out of stock, the standalone headset is on sale for the same price. Also at Best Buy, PlayStation and others. Cyber Monday gaming keyboard deals Lemokey P1 HE for $134 at Amazon ($36 off): The P1 HE is an honorable mention in our guide to the best gaming keyboards. It pairs a premium aluminum design with a fantastic typing feel and magnetic switches that let you customize the sensitivity of each press. The latter can be especially useful for competitive-style games. Its software is a pain, though. This deal marks the best price we’ve seen, but it’s only for Amazon Prime members. Everyone else can grab it at Keychron (Lemokey’s parent brand) for $136. ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless for $130 at Amazon ($80 off): If the Lemokey P1 HE runs out of stock, or if you want something closer to a full-size layout, the ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless is another wireless mechanical keyboard we like. It makes typing feel and sound lovely, though it can’t do any of the Hall effect customizations of the top picks in our guide. This deal ties an all-time low. Also at Best Buy and ASUS. Sony Inzone KBD-H75 for $278 at Amazon ($22 off): As we note in our gaming keyboard guide, the Inzone KBD-H75 ticks just about all of the boxes: a high-quality frame, versatile magnetic switches that feel and sound even nicer than our top pick, crisp PBT keycaps, decent software, even a volume knob. Its only real issue is that it’s way too expensive for a wired keyboard. It still is after this discount, but if you’ve got cash to burn, this matches the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Sony. NuPhy Air75 V2 for $84 at NuPhy ($36 off): If you’re looking for a slimmer low-profile keyboard that still uses satisfying mechanical switches, the NuPhy Air75 V2 is an older but still great option we’ve recommended in the past. This is the lowest price we’ve seen, though certain switch options are available for a few bucks more. The newer Air75 V3 is also on sale for $128; we haven’t fully reviewed that one yet, but it should offer a more bouncy typing experience with superior sound dampening. Cyber Monday gaming mouse deals Razer Viper V3 Pro for $130 at Amazon ($30 off): The Viper V3 Pro is the top pick in our guide to the best gaming mice for those who prefer a symmetrical shape. Its sturdy design is comfortable for a wide range of hand sizes and grip types, it performs just about flawlessly in competitive-style games and it’s ultra-lightweight without having any debris-collecting holes in its outer shell. This is the lowest price we’ve seen in several months. Also at Best Buy. Razer DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed for $70 at Amazon ($30 off): The DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed is a midrange option we recommend in our guide if you prefer a more ergonomic shape. Its contoured design is ideal for small- to medium-sized hands, it tracks reliably and at 55 grams it’s easy to flick around in fast-paced games. This deal marks a new low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Razer Basilisk V3 for $29 at Amazon ($17 off): If you don’t mind using a cable, the Basilisk V3 is another ergonomic model we highlight in our buying guide. It’s relatively heavy and bulky but very much comfortable for larger hands, with an impressively versatile scroll wheel that can tilt side-to-side and switch between notched and free-spin modes. This is the lowest price we’ve tracked. The wireless Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed is also on sale for $38, though that one has a more limited scroll wheel and trades the wired version’s optical clicks for less durable mechanical switches. Also at Target for $35. Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite for $50 at Best Buy ($40 off): We consider the Scimitar RGB Elite to be the best value mouse for MMO and MOBA players, as it comes with 12 programmable side buttons that make it easier to pull off complex commands in games like Final Fantasy XIV or World of Warcraft. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked in the past year. A newer wireless variant called the Scimitar Elite Wireless SE is also on sale for $75, which is a new low. Also at Corsair. Pulsar X2 CrazyLight for $91 at Amazon ($39 off): The aptly-named X2 CrazyLight is an honorable mention in our buying guide for those who mainly play twitchy shooter games and use a claw or fingertip grip, as its compact design weighs a mere 37 grams. This is the lowest price we’ve seen, and the discount applies to several colorways. Pulsar Xlite V4 for $50 at Pulsar ($50 off): The Xlite V4 is another honorable mention in our guide if you’re after a light, comfortable and responsive mouse with an ergonomic shape. The downside is it has cutouts on the bottom, which leaves the interior exposed to dust and debris. We actually tested the older Xlite V3, but the V4 is a very minor refresh that’s currently available for the same price, so it’s worth grabbing instead. The mini version is available with the same discount. Cyber Monday gaming headset deals Turtle Beach Atlas Air for $130 at Amazon ($50 off): The Atlas Air is the top pick in our guide to the best gaming headsets and one of the few wireless pairs with an open-back design. That gives it a far more spacious and immersive sound than most of its closed-back peers. It’s highly comfortable too, though it can’t block much outside noise, nor can it connect to Xbox consoles wirelessly. While not an all-time low, this is the best price we’ve seen since February. Also at Best Buy and Turtle Beach. HyperX Cloud Stinger 2 for $30 at Amazon ($20 off): The wired Cloud Stinger 2 is the budget pick in our gaming headset buying guide. It’s comfy, with a solid mic and full-bodied bass. Just don’t expect the most accurate sound or highest-quality materials at this price. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Astro A50 X for $320 at Amazon ($80 off): The A50 X is a higher-end wireless headset we recommend in our guide for those who game across PS5, Xbox and PC. Its included charging station doubles as an HDMI switcher, allowing you to swap between different three different sources with the press of a button. An excellent mic and mostly balanced sound profile help as well. This deal isn’t an all-time low but still takes a good chunk off the headset’s normal going rate. Also at Best Buy and Logitech. Logitech G Pro X 2 Lightspeed for $210 at Amazon ($70 off): We call the G Pro X 2 Lightspeed a quality alternative to the Audeze Maxwell — our favorite closed-back wireless headset — in our buying guide when it’s on sale for significantly less. That’s the case right now, as this discount drops the headset to its best price since July. Also at Best Buy and Logitech. Fractal Design Scape for $140 at Amazon ($60 off): The Fractal Scape is another closed-back headset worth considering thanks to its clean sound quality, convenient magnetic charging dock and more understated design than most options in this market. Engadget’s Igor Bonifacic called it “an excellent all-around package” in his review. The built-in mic could be better, though. This deal represents a new low. Also at B&H. Sony PlayStation Pulse Elite for $129 at Amazon ($21 off): It’s not a top pick in our guide, but the Pulse Elite is a decent wireless option for PS5 owners since it lets you adjust the EQ curve and access other settings directly from the console’s UI. It can also pair to a second device simultaneously over Bluetooth. The flimsy space-age design and poor noise isolation aren’t ideal, however. This deal comes within a dollar of the headset’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-cyber-monday-gaming-deals-for-2025-save-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-ps5-consoles-xbox-controllers-tons-of-games-and-more-172904924.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Nintendo gear is always sought after during the holiday shopping season, but this year likely more so than others. The Nintendo Switch 2 is the console launch of 2025 and it will undoubtedly be at the top of many wish lists for both kids and adults alike. If you were hoping to save a bit on the console on Cyber Monday, you may be disappointed. The Nintendo Cyber Monday sale was announced a few weeks ago, and unsurprisingly, there aren't a lot of true \"deals\" to be had. This is typical of Nintendo — legit Nintendo Cyber Monday deals are hard to come by — but there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you're going to pick up a Switch 2 before the year is out. As has been the case for many years, the marquee Nintendo deals for the holidays come in the form of console bundles. When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499. Both options are still available now. Considering the games by themselves cost $70 each, you do save a bit by picking up a console bundle. you can pick up the console and its bundles at most retailers including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and others. As of Cyber Monday, there is one actual deal on the Switch 2 that wasn't available for Black Friday. Amazon and Walmart currently have the Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle for $50, bringing it down to $449. Note, though, that on Amazon, you'll have to add the bundle to your cart to see the discounted price. Same thing on Walmart, but you'll also have to be signed into a Walmart account, which is free to make. There's no telling how long this deal will last; we're already seeing it go in and out of stock at Amazon, so your best bet (as of Cyber Monday evening) may be Walmart. Nintendo Switch game deals When it comes to deals on Nintendo Switch 2 games, the Nintendo eShop will have Cyber Deals starting on November 20, running through December 3. The shop will feature \"holiday offers on select games,\" so it appears we'll all just have to go to the online store on November 20 to see the games on offer. Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe, as well as other classics like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3. Nintendo Switch accessory deals Switch 2 accessories were conspicuously absent from the announced deals, but there's always a chance they'll receive discounts from third-party retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy. A handful of official Nintendo accessories made it onto our best Switch 2 accessories list, but you can find plenty of good ones from other manufacturers as well. If you're keen on getting a first-party accessory, though, for yourself or as a gift for someone else, here's where you can find some of the most popular ones. Joy-Con 2 bundle Amazon Walmart GameStop Best Buy Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller Amazon Walmart GameStop Best Buy Nintendo Switch 2 Camera Amazon Walmart GameStop Best Buy Nintendo Hori Nintendo Switch 2 Piranha Plant Camera Amazon Best Buy Joy-Con 2 Wheels (set of 2) Amazon Walmart GameStop Best Buy Nintendo More Nintendo Cyber Monday deals Even if you can't get huge discounts on Nintendo consoles or new games this year, that doesn't mean you can't find decent deals on other Nintendo gear. There are plenty of great ideas for gifts for the Nintendo fan in your life, and Engadget's Sam Rutherford got to see a bunch of them in person when he attended Nintendo's holiday showcase. From collectibles to clothing to plushies and holiday decor, there's really a ton to choose from — but you may want to pace yourself if you're also a Nintendo fan finding things that you want to pick up for yourself in the process of looking for good gifts. Here are just some of the best Nintendo gift ideas that you can look out for during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

          "standfirst": "The PlayStation 5 received a major Cyber Monday discount, with $100 off all models. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, this is the deal to beat. You'll find the deals direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. We're seeing some of the consoles go in and out of stock at this point, but if you check back at your preferred retailer, most of them have come back in stock within a few hours. Sony’s flagship console remains one of the most popular gaming systems available, and this Cyber Monday discount makes it even easier to jump in if you haven’t already. The standard PS5 and the slimmer PS5 Digital Edition both offer fast load times, smooth frame rates and crisp visuals powered by the custom AMD Zen 2 processor and RDNA 2 GPU. The difference between them comes down to the disc drive — the standard model includes one, while the Digital Edition relies entirely on digital downloads. For those who want top-tier performance, the PS5 Pro is also getting a rare $100 discount. It features upgraded specs and enhanced ray tracing for sharper graphics, along with improved cooling to handle more demanding titles. Whether you play cinematic single-player hits or fast-paced competitive games, the PS5 lineup remains one of the strongest options on the market for next-gen gaming. Each console supports 4K output, 3D audio and access to PlayStation Plus, which unlocks online multiplayer and a rotating library of free games. The DualSense controller remains a highlight, with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback that make everything from racing to combat feel more immersive. If you’re already set with a console, there are also a few solid accessory deals to consider for Cyber Monday. The DualSense Wireless Controller is down to $55, a $25 discount available in multiple colors. The premium DualSense Edge controller, which adds customizable buttons and replaceable stick modules, drops to $169 during Cyber Monday. Meanwhile, the PlayStation Portal — Sony’s portable Remote Player that lets you stream games from your PS5 — gets discounted to $179. You'll find a ton of PlayStation Cyber Monday deals across the web right now, and they also include some game sales.

          "standfirst": "December is finally here, meaning the winter months are just about upon us. In the cold, there are few things better than staying in and watching your favorite shows. Thankfully, there are lots of Cyber Monday streaming deals available this year. If you're not sure about Starz, you can test the waters by paying $3 monthly, down from $11. However, this 73 percent discount is only available for your first three months and then goes back up to full price. Basically, if you're at all interested, it's only an extra $3 for an extra nine months if you pay annually. If Starz isn't for you, check out some of the other great streaming deals available for Cyber Monday. There's discounts like six months of Apple TV for only $36 or $96 off one year of a Disney+ and Hulu bundle. Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Cyber Monday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Cyber Monday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Cyber Monday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Cyber Monday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month.

However, this 73 percent discount is only available for your first three months and then goes back up to full price. Basically, if you're at all interested, it's only an extra $3 for an extra nine months if you pay annually. If Starz isn't for you, check out some of the other great streaming deals available for Cyber Monday. There's discounts like six months of Apple TV for only $36 or $96 off one year of a Disney+ and Hulu bundle. Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1. New and eligible returning subscribers can take advantage of this deal, and considering the bundle typically costs $13 per month, this deal represents more than a 50 percent discount on the standard monthly price. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Cyber Monday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Cyber Monday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Cyber Monday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Cyber Monday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month.

          "standfirst": "Paramount+ has launched its latest streaming offer, giving new subscribers two months of access for $6 total through Cyber Monday. With prices rising across other platforms, this short-term deal offers a chance to explore either the Essential or Premium plan and see which fits your viewing habits best. Yes, you can pick either plan and get the $3-per-month deal — of course, that makes the Premium plan the better option in terms of the greater discount. The deal runs through December 2. Paramount+ continues to expand its catalog with a mix of current CBS shows, exclusive originals, classic TV and live sports. The service is available in two main tiers: Essential, which includes ads, and Premium, which removes most of them and adds a few key extras like 4K streaming, offline downloads and live CBS access. Both tiers include select Showtime programming, giving subscribers a taste of the premium network’s lineup. The Essential plan provides access to more than 40,000 episodes and movies, along with live coverage of the NFL on CBS and UEFA Champions League matches. It supports up to three simultaneous streams, making it a practical choice for households that share accounts. The Premium plan builds on that by offering ad-free on-demand viewing (with exceptions for live broadcasts), higher-quality playback and the option to watch CBS live in participating regions. Paramount+’s growing library combines new releases with well-known favorites, offering titles from across CBS, MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. Sports fans get live coverage of key events, while movie watchers can find recent cinema releases from Paramount Pictures joining the lineup throughout the year. The inclusion of Showtime series in both plans adds another layer of variety, with dramas and documentaries available alongside the core Paramount+ content. If you’re keeping an eye on subscription costs, an offer like this is a practical way to test the service without paying full price. It also gives you time to see whether the Essential plan’s ad-supported setup or the Premium tier’s extras are worth the difference. If you’ve been watching your streaming spend as prices go up elsewhere, this deal from Paramount+ offers a well-balanced opportunity to experience both plan levels at a lower cost. Paramount+ is one of the best streaming services thanks to its vast selection of original shows like Star Trek: Discovery, Ink Master and Frasier. If you’re ready to stream big shows and live events without a heavy commitment this Cyber Monday offer is one to keep in mind. There are plenty of other Cyber Monday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Disney+ Hulu bundle — $60 for one year: The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through December 1.

You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads.

          "standfirst": "Cyber Monday is almost over — so if you didn't get a chance to get everything on your list during Black Friday (or were too tired from Thanksgiving to shop) now is likely your last chance to snag the better deals. If Anker gear is on your list, there’s good news: every deal we found last week is still going strong. We think Anker makes some of the most reliable charging gear out there, which is why it keeps winning out in our tests and ending up in our guides to MagSafe power banks, wireless charging stations, iPhone accessories and more. So forget all that stuff about early birds, there are plenty of worms for the later birds, too. Just don't wait too long, our guess is that many of these deals will expire Monday night. Here are the best Cyber Monday Anker deals we could find. Anker Cyber Monday deals: Power banks Power banks revive dead phones, let you work longer while away from an outlet and allow you to play with your tablet/ereader/gamepad while it charges without being tethered to a wall. After testing out brands from a slew of different makers, our picks just keep coming back to Anker. The mix of value, capacity and clever features make Anker batteries just a little bit better than a lot of the brands out there. Anker's Laptop Power Bank, which our reviewer (me) called the culmination of all the best battery features is going for nearly $50 of right now. If could recommend one purchase to Engadget readers, this would be it. We think Anker's Ultra-Slim MagSafe bank is a better deal than Apple's Air MagSafe battery. It's got a higher capacity and wattage rating and it looks just as sleek. Plus, in my humble opinion, $38 is a way better deal than $99. Anker also makes our top MagSafe battery pick (the MagGo Qi2). Thanks to its clever stand, excellent charging speeds and generous capacity, it's one of the best ways to recharge an iPhone on the go.. I love this shiny little brick. The 3-in-1 portable charger has a built-in cable that's also a strap, plus wall prongs and a handy display. Anker Cyber Monday deals: Wireless chargers A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the loveliest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy solution. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our wireless charger guide and our list of the best multi-device chargers. Now, thanks to Cyber Monday, you can keep your devices topped off with quality accessories that are an even better value than usual. Anker Cyber Monday deals: Power adapters While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our guide to the best fast chargers and we recommend the brand in a number of our accessories guides. Now that Cyber Monday is here, a number of Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here. Anker Cyber Monday deals: Soundcore audio We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. They also make our overall favorite pair of budget earbuds, the Space A40. With Cyber Monday deals in full effect, these are the best Anker Soundcore deals we could find. Cyber Monday deals on Ugreen, Biolite, Nimble and more We’re fans of plenty of other brands aside from just Anker. Here are some of the other charging accessories that are also on sale for Cyber Monday. These come from our guide to MagSafe power banks, our standard power bank guide and our best fast charger roundup. If you want to read up on why these guys made the cut, check out those links. But if you just want to snag a few deals on electronics that Engadget has vetted, check out our picks below. More Anker Cyber Monday deals My personal favorite USB-C charging cable is made by Anker. It’s rated at 240 watts, has a durable build, plus it’s six-feet long and has a handy right angled connector at one end. Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that show up in our guides to the best accessories again and again. Here are the best Cyber Monday deals on Anker gear that doesn’t quite fit into the categories above.

If you've been waiting for a serious sale to pick up a mic of your own, Cyber Monday may be your chance. The DJI Mic Mini kit is on sale for more than half off: you can snag it for a mere $80. That's an all-time low price compared to the set's usual $170 price tag. The full package includes two mics, a receiver and a charging case, as well as two windscreens and other accessories. Depending on what peripherals you need along with your wireless microphone, DJI has several other promising Cyber Monday deals. If you don't want the charging case, you can get the Mic Mini without for just $66, which is a of 45 percent discount. Another option is a bundle featuring a single mic, receiver, charging dock and accessories for $45, or 49 percent off the regular price. DJI's Mic Mini microphones (transmitters) weigh just a third of an ounce and attach easily to subjects via magnets or clips. Everything pairs automatically and they offer high quality 24-bit, 20Hz to 20K Hz recording. They also connect easily to smartphones over Bluetooth and other DJI devices like the Action 5 Pro and Osmo Pocket 3 cams using DJI's OsmoAudio direct connection. With a range of 1300 feet and 48 hours of battery life with the charger case, they're an excellent addition to a creator's bag of tricks. Again, note that you can grab one a big cheaper without the charging case.

          "standfirst": "Sonos is offering several deals on home audio for Cyber Monday. One of the standouts is a discount of $100 on the Sonos Era 300, which is available now for $379. Sonos' Era line has previously included one of our top smart speaker picks, and the Era 300 is the only standalone speaker from the company that offers spatial audio. The spatial audio angle is the highlight feature for the Era 300, which can stream compatible tracks from either Apple Music or Amazon Music. While the spatial audio features proved to be hit and miss in our review, this is still an outstanding speaker with excellent audio quality. It delivers rich, detailed and balanced audio that can hang with just about anything else Sonos offers. The speaker supports voice control via Alexa or Sonos Voice Control. It also offers Trueplay tuning, which listens to how your room shapes the sound and adjusts accordingly. In this model, you don't need to use your phone: Its built-in mics scan your room for you. That's especially handy for Android users, since phone-based Trueplay (from other models) is iOS-only. If the Era 300 is a bit out of your budget, Sonos has loads of other products on sale for Cyber Monday. You can get the smaller — but still mighty — Era 100 for $169 (23 percent off). The portable Move 2 is down to $399 (20 percent off). Even the company's headphones, Sonos Ace, are on sale for $279 (30 percent off). Sonos home theater products are discounted, too. You can get the Arc Ultra soundbar for $879 (20 percent off), or the Sub 4 subwoofer for $719 (also 20 percent off). Or, if you're in the market for both and have the budget, save even more on a bundle: Get the Arc Ultra and Sub 4 for $1,499 (25 percent off).

          "title": "The best Cyber Monday camera and drone deals: Get up to 52 percent off from Sony, DJI and others",
          "standfirst": "Cyber Monday is a good time to consider picking up tech you may have had your eye on for a bit. That means big ticket items like cameras, drones and the like. Major camera and drone makers including Sony, Canon, DJI, Nikon and GoPro are still offering substantial discounts across a wide range of products ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Those include options from our guide to the best cameras, so you'll get great value for tried and tested gear. These are the best Cyber Monday camera deals you can get for 2025. Best Cyber Monday camera and drone deals Sony A7 IV for $1,998 (26 percent off): Sony's A7 IV is still one of the best hybrid cameras you can get thanks to the high resolution, fast shooting speeds and 4K 60p video. Autofocus is incredible for both video and stills, and it comes with in-body stabilization to help smooth your shots. And for photographers, image quality has never been better thanks to the high dynamic range and enhanced resolution compared to the A7 III. GoPro Hero 13 Black for $319 (26 percent off): GoPro’s Hero 13 Black is now available with a new family of modular lenses called the HB series (ultra-wide, anamorphic and macro), making it far more versatile for action creators. It also has a slightly bigger battery that allows longer capture times, up to 90 minutes for 4K 30fps video. Other specs remain the same, including up to 5.3K at 60fps in 10-bit color, along with the excellent Hypersmooth stabilization. And if you want an even wider field of view, grab the Hero 13 Black Wide Edition for $329. DJI Osmo Pocket 3 for $529 (34 percent off): When DJI's Osmo Pocket 3 came out I said was \"maybe the only vlogging camera you need.\" It has a big one-inch sensor that boosts image quality considerably, particularly in low light. You also get a large swiveling touchscreen that makes it easier to switch between horizontal and vertical video. What really makes it great for vlogging, though, are the follow modes combined with face tracking. When working solo, you can simply set it up and it’ll rotate and tilt to follow you around — so you don’t have to worry about focus or even pointing the camera at yourself. There’s very little not to like about the Osmo Pocket 3, but it’s not ideal for photos and is also quite expensive. But with the Black Friday deal and Pocket 4 on the horizon, it's a great time to get one. Canon EOS R100 with 18-45mm kit lens for $499 (27 percent off): Canon's EOS R100 is the best deal on a mirrorless camera with a kit lens, and this is the lowest price we've seen to date. It comes with a 24-megapixel APS-C sensor that delivers great picture quality with Canon's pleasing skin tones, offers rapid and accurate autofocus and lets you shoot 4K (cropped) video at up to 24 fps. DJI Osmo 360 for $357 (35 percent off): DJI’s Osmo 360 is a worthy rival to Insta360’s X5, thanks to the innovative sensor and 8K 50 fps video. It also matches or beats its rival in other areas, with similar battery life and superior low-light capability. Other positives include seamless 360 stitching, compatibility with DJI's mics and accessories, and excellent ease of use. The one negative is the editing app, which lacks some features found on Insta360's app. OM SYSTEM Olympus E-M10 IV with 14-42mm kit lens for $700 (22 percent off): OM Systems' Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV offers a great mix of photography and video features and is on sale with a solid kit lens. You get up to 15 fps shooting speeds, 4K 30p or HD 120p video, and it’s one of the few cameras in this price category with built-in five-axis stabilization. It’s portable and lightweight for travel, and the lenses are compact and affordable. The drawbacks are an autofocus system that’s not as fast or accurate as the competition, and a small sensor size. DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro for $259 (24 percent off): The Action 5 Pro features a large 1/1.3-inch sensor that makes it better than the Hero 13 in low light. It also tops the action cam battery life charts at two hours-plus while shooting 4K 60fps. Another nice feature is 47GB of internal storage, a big help if you forget your microSD memory card. And the Osmo Action 5 Pro works directly with DJI’s noise-cancelling Mic 2 and Mic Mini wireless microphones, providing an easy way to record high-quality sound. You can also grab the Action 4 Pro with the same sensor for just $199, or 31 percent off the regular price. DJI Mini 4K drone Fly More Combo for $359 (20 percent off): The Mini 4K is a beginner-friendly drone, but it's still got plenty of nifty features. As the name suggests, it can capture 4K video at up to 30 FPS. It can also record 2.7K footage at 60 FPS. There's 2x digital zoom, a 3-axis gimbal and electrical image stabilization. The drone can transmit 1080p video from up to 10km away. Panasonix Lumix S9 in green for $1,398 with 18-45mm kit lens (22 percent off): The S9 may be Panasonic's smallest full-frame camera but it comes with the same 24MP sensor and similar video features to the popular S5 II. To that end, it offers up to 6.2K video, in-body stabilization and reliable autofocus. The key feature though is a special LUT button that lets you easily choose a custom cinematic look designed by professional creators. Fujifilm X-T50 with XC 15-45mm lens for $1,599 (6 percent off): Fujifilm’s X-T50 is a big improvement over the X-T30 II, thanks to its higher resolution sensor, in-body stabilization and upgraded video capabilities. It's relatively small and lightweight and has solid autofocus and decent shooting speeds of up to 13 fps. Fujifilm cameras rarely go on sale, so if you're in the market for this model, now's the time to act. Canon EOS R50 for $679 (13 percent off): Canon's 24-megapixel APS-C EOS R50 is great for travel, parties, street photography and more thanks to the portable size and built-in flash. It offers nice image quality with warm, human friendly photos and is capable for creators as well with 4K 30fps supersampled video, with 10-bit and HDR capability. It comes with a kit lens that's solid for vlogging or photography with a 24-70mm full-frame equivalent zoom range. Panasonic Lumix S5 II for $1,498 (25 percent off): The Lumix S5 II is an ideal vlogging camera, thanks to its excellent 6K 10-bit video, powerful stabilization system and phase-detect autofocus. It also offers features that creators need like excellent monitoring tools and advanced audio features, along with the 3.68-million dot EVF and flip-out display. Nikon Z6 III for $2,097 (22 percent off): The Nikon Z6 III is one of the best hybrid creator cameras you can buy, thanks to the incredible performance of its partially stacked sensor. You can shoot RAW bursts at up to 20 fps in electronic shutter mode while nailing sharp shots thanks to the much-improved autofocus. On the video side, it supports 6K RAW at up to 60 fps, or 4K 120p. The only thing holding it back from dethroning Sony is image quality that’s compromised a bit by the relatively low resolution and reduced dynamic range. Sony A7R V for $3,298 (21 percent off): With a 61-megapixel sensor, Sony’s A7R V shoots sharp and beautiful images at a very respectable speed for such a high-resolution model (10 fps). It has equally fast and reliable autofocus, the sharpest viewfinder on the market and in-body stabilization that’s much improved over the A7R IV. Video has even improved, with 8K and 10-bit options now on tap, albeit with significant rolling shutter. Canon EOS R5 Mark II for $3,899 (11 percent off): The EOS R5 II comes with a high-resolution 45-megapixel stacked sensor, but still lets you shoot blackout-free bursts at up to 30 fps (and it can pre-capture up to 15 photos when you half press the shutter button). The updated autofocus with AI tracking is as good as anything offered by Sony and it's also highly capable for video, with up to 8K 60p RAW and 4K 120p shooting. Nikon Z8 for $3,496 (18 percent off): Nikon's Z8 offers the same specs as the company’s Z9 flagship in a smaller body but costs a lot less. It’s one of the highest resolution full-frame cameras with 45 megapixels, but also one of the fastest with burst speeds up to 30 fps. At the same time, it has powerful video capabilities with 8K RAW video at up to 60 fps. Autofocus isn’t on par with Sony’s A1, but the Z8 is a better camera for the price. Best Cyber Monday camera lens and accessory deals Osmo Mobile 7P for $103 (20 percent off): This three-axis gimbal keeps your smartphone video as smooth as can be with DJI's ActiveTrack 7.0, and includes a magnetic snapping mechanism so you can install your mobile device in seconds. The latest feature is native tracking that follows you around, thanks to the included Multifunctional Module. K&F Concept 20L camera backpack for $66 (20 percent off): This multifunction backpack can store not only cameras, lenses and even drones in the bottom section, but a couple of changes of clothes up top. It has a laptop compartment, ventilated elastic back, auxiliary straps and more. SmallRig Camera Tripod for $49 (30 percent off): This 2-in-1 tripod easily transforms into a monopod depending on your needs. It comes with a 360-degree detachable ball head, supports up to 33 pounds and lets you adjust the working height from 16- to 71-inches in seconds. Rode Wireless Micro for $83 (10 percent off): Another great wireless mic option is Rode's Wireless Micro designed for smartphone users. The receiver connects to the bottom of your smartphone via USB-C and the microphones attach to the subject via integrated clips or magnets. They capture pristine sound well above what your smartphone can do, with a 20-20 kHz frequency range and 73 dB signal-to-noise ratio. DJI Mic 2 for $199 (26 percent off): DJI's Mic 2 can not only be connected to a mirrorless camera like other mics, but also supports Bluetooth audio so can easily be connected to a smartphone as well. It picks up audio from your subject at a range of up to 820 feet (less with a Bluetooth connection) and automatically reduces background noise like wind, city sounds and even drone noise. And unlike the Mic 3, it lets you plug in an external microphone. This deal includes two mic transmitters, a receiver for your camera, a charging case and wind muffs. DJI RS 4 Mini $289 (22 percent off): The RS 4 Mini is one of the best handheld camera stabilizers on the market thanks to features like its 4.4 pound payload and automatic axis lock. On top of that, the company introduced automatic tracking via its RS Intelligent Tracking Module to keep human subjects in frame no matter where they go. It also offers smoother gimbal tracking, longer battery life and faster charging. SanDisk 512GB Extreme PRO SDXC UHS-II Memory Card for $280 (15 percent off): High speed SD memory cards rarely go on sale, but you can grab one of the best ones for a cool 15 percent off the regular price. It'll let you capture longer photo bursts and high-bandwidth MP4 video with no issues. Lexar 64GB Professional 2000x SD Card $48 (31 percent off): If you need very fast SD UHS II memory, Lexar currently has an excellent deal on its 64GB 2000x memory card. It offers 300MB/s read and 260Mb/s write speeds, quick enough to capture high data rate video or bursts of high-resolution photos. Amazon is also offering a solid discount on 256GB memory in the same lineup at $165 or 23 percent off. Samsung Evo Select 512GB microSD memory card for $33 (30 percent off): This card offers a lot of storage for the money at this price, but it's fast enough to handle 4K video for drone and action camera storage. Samsung P9 512GB microSD Express memory card for $75 (25 percent off): If you want a fast card for your drone or action cam that can also be used on a Switch 2, Samsung has the answer.

Aputure MC RGBWW LED Light for $72 (20 percent off): This is a popular video light that can provide primary illumination or be used as a background light for interviews and more. I can attest that this product rarely goes on sale, so now's the time to snap one up. Manfrotto Befree GT PRO 4-section travel tripod $299 (36 percent off): Belying its miniscule 4.23 pound weight, this model offers ultra-stable performance for timelapse and other shots, even in bad weather. It's also great for video thanks to the integrated 3-way pan/tilt head, featuring fluid cartridges for precise control and seamless movements.

It not only adapts EF lenses perfectly to the RF mount, it gives you full electronic autofocus and exposure control. Panasonic Lumix G 25mm f/1.7 lens $197 (34 percent off): Panasonic and Micro Four Thirds users on a budget in need of a fast 50mm equivalent prime should check this one out. It offers beautiful bokeh and fast speeds in low light, but costs nearly half the price of f/1.4 models. Sony FE50mm f/1.8 lens for $228 (19 percent off): With a fast f/1.8 aperture, this lens produces great bokeh to help you separate your subject from the foreground. With this sale, it's Sony's cheapest prime portrait lens that still offers excellent sharpness.

At the same time, it offers exceptional sharpness and excellent color rendition, with beautiful bokeh that will flatter your subjects. Panasonic Lumix S 85mm f/1.8 lens $448 (31 percent off): I own this lens and it's fast, sharp and versatile for portraits while offering considerable savings compared to an f/1.4 portrait. It's also great for working pros due to the dust-, splash- and freeze-resistant design and very light weight next to other brands. Nikon Nikkor Z 35mm f/1.4 Lens $577 (15 percent off): If you're looking for a fast full-frame Nikon Z prime in the 35-50mm category for portraits, architecture or street photos, Nikon has a stellar deal.

It's great for video as well, with the silent STM mechanism offering silent autofocus and suppressed focus breathing. Canon RF24-70mm F2.8 L lens $2,299 (12 percent off): If you've been eyeballing a fast Canon RF mount zoom, now's the time to act.

DJI RS 4 Mini $289 (22 percent off): The RS 4 Mini is one of the best handheld camera stabilizers on the market thanks to features like its 4.4 pound payload and automatic axis lock.

Manfrotto Befree GT PRO 4-section travel tripod $299 (36 percent off): Belying its miniscule 4.23 pound weight, this model offers ultra-stable performance for timelapse and other shots, even in bad weather. It's also great for video thanks to the integrated 3-way pan/tilt head, featuring fluid cartridges for precise control and seamless movements.

It not only adapts EF lenses perfectly to the RF mount, it gives you full electronic autofocus and exposure control. Panasonic Lumix G 25mm f/1.7 lens $197 (34 percent off): Panasonic and Micro Four Thirds users on a budget in need of a fast 50mm equivalent prime should check this one out.

Sony FE50mm f/1.8 lens for $228 (19 percent off): With a fast f/1.8 aperture, this lens produces great bokeh to help you separate your subject from the foreground.

At the same time, it offers exceptional sharpness and excellent color rendition, with beautiful bokeh that will flatter your subjects. Panasonic Lumix S 85mm f/1.8 lens $448 (31 percent off): I own this lens and it's fast, sharp and versatile for portraits while offering considerable savings compared to an f/1.4 portrait. It's also great for working pros due to the dust-, splash- and freeze-resistant design and very light weight next to other brands. Nikon Nikkor Z 35mm f/1.4 Lens $577 (15 percent off): If you're looking for a fast full-frame Nikon Z prime in the 35-50mm category for portraits, architecture or street photos, Nikon has a stellar deal. The Nikkor Z 35mm f/1.4 lens is fast and sharp with painterly bokeh thanks to the 9-blade iris design. It's great for video as well, with the silent STM mechanism offering silent autofocus and suppressed focus breathing. Canon RF24-70mm F2.8 L lens $2,299 (12 percent off): If you've been eyeballing a fast Canon RF mount zoom, now's the time to act. The RF24-70mm f/2.8 L lens rarely goes on sale, but is now available with a $200 (8 percent) discount. It offers an f/2.8 aperture across the entire zoom range so you get awesome bokeh for portraits and high versatility in low light situations.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-cyber-monday-camera-and-drone-deals-get-up-to-52-percent-off-from-sony-dji-and-others-082305849.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Cyber Monday, in all its discount-laden glory has officially arrived. If you're not among the sliver of the population dropping $7,000 on all new appliances for your kitchen, you can shop here and get a whole gaggle of electronics for less than $50 a pop. This list is composed of those smaller yet infinitely useful gadgets and accessories that keep your TV, tablet, laptop and phones all working and charged up properly. There are even a few items here that are primary players, not just sidekicks, such as smart speakers, Lego sets and a surprisingly popular pill shaver. A few streaming subs for less than $50 are also on sale. Here are the best Engadget-recommended gadgets that are on sale for Cyber Monday. Cyber Monday deals under $50: Engadget's top picks HBO Max with ads (one year) for $36 ($96 off): HBO has been around a lot longer than Apple TV, and it’s got a treasure trove of winners — The Sopranos, The Wire, Veep, Insecure, Girls, Deadwood — with its back catalogue alone, you’ll never run out of high quality entertainment. Plus it has a huge movie library and quite a few current shows that are pretty good, too (The Last of Us and The Chair Company come to mind). Note that the deal applies to the ad-supported tier and will auto-renew after a year unless you cancel. You can get the deal through HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber, you can get the deal as an add-on to your service. Paramount+ Essential or Premium (2 months) for $6 ($20 or $10 off): This deal applies to either the Premium or Essential tier — both are just $6 for two months of service (or $3 monthly). The Premium plan is the better deal as it’s usually $13 per month, doesn’t have ads, includes Showtime and allows downloads for offline viewing. Of course, whichever tier you choose will hop back up to the full price after two months unless you cancel (which is $13 per month for Premium and $8 per month for ad-supported Essential). Audible (3 months) for $3 ($42 off): As it does each Cyber Monday (and at a few points besides), Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. With the plan, you get one audiobook of your choice each month, which includes new and bestseller titles. You can also listen to an unlimited number of titles from a narrower library. A membership also grants access to a daily discounted title and other member-only discounts. With this deal, the plan will auto-renew at a dollar per month for three months, then default to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. The offer ends December 1. Starz (one year) for $12 ($50 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Starz annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Also available as a Hulu add-on. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Echo Glow Multicolor smart lamp for $20 ($10 off) at Amazon: Every sales event, Amazon puts this thing on sale. And every time, I contemplate buying it. Engadget hasn’t tested it, but we’ve tried enough Amazon hardware to know it probably does what it’s supposed to do — which is pair with an Alexa speaker and light up according to your instructions. That's it. Is that worth $30? Probably not. But maybe it’s worth $20? Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger (10K mAh, 30W) for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon: I love this sleek little box. First and foremost, it’s a 10K mAh power bank (enough to refill a phone 1.5 to two times). But it also has a built-in USB-C cable (so you’ll never be without one) and flip-up wall prongs so it can refill directly from the wall (it even supports pass-through charging). Also available directly from Anker. Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and they work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app. That means, if you too are a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants, you can ask one of them to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 previously. Also at B&H Photo. Best Cyber Monday deals under $15 Anker USB-C Cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off) at Amazon: If you just need a reliable and long charger for your phone, pick this one up while it’s just $9. It can shuttle 100 watts to your handset and, in our experience, Anker cables are plenty durable — plus its red! This can handle data transfers in a pinch, but is limited to 480 Mbps. Anker SD memory Card Reader (USB-C, SD and microSD) for $9 ($9 off): This might be an ideal representative of an Anker product: A simple, moderately-priced solution that just works. I needed an SD card reader with a USB-C connection. I bought this one. It works. I’m happy. Anker USB-C Cable (240W, 10ft) for $12 ($5 off) at Amazon: If you’re sick of the sub-par, half-broken, super-short cables occupying your junk drawer, just grab a couple of these. With the max power delivery possible for USB-C at 240W, it’ll always be ready to charge anything. Just note, this is better for charging as its data transfer rates max out at 480 Mbps. Also available directly from Anker. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $11 ($9 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $1 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. Its 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh for just $13. Anker Nano 3 Charger (30W, 1-port) for $13 ($5 off) at Amazon: This tiny and colorful block is one of our favorite fast chargers for 2025. It’ll send up to 30 watts of power to whatever you plug into it. That’s more than enough to fast-charge any smartphone and plenty of juice for your tablets. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Belkin Secure Holder for Apple AirTag for $14 ($6 off): This is one of our recommendations in our guide to AirTag accessories. The braided wire attachment makes it extra strong and secure. We think it’s an ideal way to create a luggage tag for your AirTag. A four-pack is on sale too. Bellemonde Kent Paper Screen Protector for iPad (2-pack) for $9 ($9 off with Prime) at Amazon: We named this paper-esque screen protector one of the best iPad accessories for 2025. I put one on my iPad a couple years ago and have been happy ever since. It creates a satisfying texture for the Apple Pencil and it adds a matte, but perfectly clear, finish to the screen. Just be sure to double check you’re grabbing the right size for your particular iPad model. Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $13 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Best Cyber Monday deals under $20 Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Roku: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Also at Amazon. Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $16 ($13 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Amazon: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Also at Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Anker Nano fast charger block (45W, 1 port) for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: This is just about the max power you can get out of a tiny block like this. Anker’s 45-watt charger is more than enough oomph for phones and tablets, and can even handle a laptop refill in a pinch. The little plug prongs fold down and it even comes with a six-foot USB-C cable. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. Baseus Picogo MagSafe Power Bank (5K mAh, 10W) for $19 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: We tested a newer version of this MagSafe bank for our battery guide. It’s Qi-certified (not Qi2) so you won’t get top charging speeds out of it. But if you need a partial refill for a phone, $19 is hard to beat. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $19 (37 percent off) at Amazon: If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Echo Glow Multicolor smart lamp for $20 ($10 off) at Amazon: Every sales event, Amazon puts this thing on sale. And every time, I contemplate buying it. Engadget hasn’t tested it, but we’ve tried enough Amazon hardware to know it probably does what it’s supposed to do — which is pair with an Alexa speaker and light up according to your instructions. That's it. Is that worth $30? Probably not. But maybe it’s worth $20? Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Roku: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Also at Amazon. Best Cyber Monday deals under $25 Amazon Echo Pop Alexa Smart Speaker for $22 ($18 off) at Amazon: Amazon’s smallest smart speaker isn’t focused so much on sound quality as it is on putting Alexa+ wherever you may need the assistant’s help. Use the little half sphere to control your connected lights, give you the weather or just have an “interesting” conversation. Last year, it dropped as low as $18 and certain colorways look to be sold out. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Cyber Monday. This cute-as-a-button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: After testing all the Bluetooth trackers I could get my hands on, I think this is the best finding fob out there. Yes, even better than an AirTag; It's louder, can ring your phone and works on the same massive Find My network as AirTags do. And for Android users, it'll work with Google's Find Hub. Check out Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers for more thoughts. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off) at Roku: The difference between this streamer and the newer 4K Plus is that one doesn’t have Dolby vision or an extended Wi-Fi range — this one does. So if you need that extra range and/or have a TV that supports Dolby Vision, this is the Roku stick to get. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $24 ($5 off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Best Cyber Monday deals under $35 Twelve South AirFly SE Bluetooth Audio Transmitter for $26 ($14 off) at Amazon: If you (or someone on your gift list) travels by plane a lot, they might appreciate this dongle. It adds a Bluetooth connection to any 3.5mm aux audio jack so they can use their AirPods or other wireless buds to watch in-flight entertainment. $26 isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen (it went as low as $16 earlier this year). Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. Also available directly from Anker and at Best Buy. EarFun Free 2S Wireless Earbuds for $28 ($12 off) at Amazon: These are the ultra-budget pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They don’t have ANC, but the sound is lively and the fit is comfortable. You aren’t getting the highest sound quality here, but if you need a knock around pair, these will do. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is $10 cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Thermacell E-Series Rechargeable Mosquito Repeller for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: As winter hits, the mosquitos give up the war to claim the backyard for themselves. But they’ll be back. This is a variant of the mosquito repeller we recommend in our guide to outdoor gear. This one has a 20-foot coverage area and sports a built-in light. Amazon Echo Dot Alexa smart speaker for $32 ($18 off) at Amazon: This is Amazon’s most popular Echo device and it’s the one my family uses most. The new Alexa+ is more conversational and can remember conversations and apply context. It’s still a work in progress, but can set timers, tell you the weather and control your smart home like a champ. It sold for as low as $23 last year. Amazon Echo Dot Kids for $32 ($28 off) at Amazon: The difference between the kids model and the standard Echo Dot is the cute cover (this one looks like an inverted planetarium) and a free year of access to Amazon Kids+, which includes audio books, games and other content for kids aged three to twelve. Just note, you’ll get more out of the subscription with an Amazon device with a screen and the subscription will automatically renew (at $6 monthly) after a year unless you cancel. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $34 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best. Plug in the generously long cable into your tablet or laptop and you’ll be able to read memory cards, use USB-A peripherals, connect a 4K monitor via HDMI and use Ethernet. The lowest price we tracked on this guy yet is $30. Anker Nano Charger Block (70W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: This specific model isn’t in our guides, but we’ve seen other Anker Nano chargers prove themselves, so we’re comfortable recommending it. This one has two USB-C ports for fast charging devices, plus a Type-A outlet for devices that need it. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) at Amazon: We recently wondered why Amazon needs so many streaming devices (Google just has one and it’s our favorite). But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching The Expanse. Anker Prime GaN wall charger (67W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: Travelers, take note. This is what we recommend to those on a journey in our guide to fast chargers. It has three ports, and can detect which plugged-in device is in most need of a refill. The 67-watt rating is all you need for phones and tablets and will even top off most laptops if needed. Also available directly from Anker. Best Cyber Monday deals under $50 Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $36 ($34 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. Anker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($14 off) at Amazon: This was almost our top pick for the best USB-C hub, but a UGreen model edged it out. But the 555 is still great with ports that include HDMI, Ethernet, two USB Type A, a power delivery USB-C and a USB-C 3.2. That should be enough to keep any tablet or laptop suitably connected. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and it’ll work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app — so if you’re a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants you can ask one to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at B&H Photo. Anker Nano Ultra Slim power bank (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $39 ($17 off) at Amazon: This super slim bank pairs nicely with an iPhone Air, or any MagSafe-compatible iPhone for that matter. It’s more affordable than Apple’s version and a top pick in our MagSafe battery guide. Twelve South PowerBug Qi2 Magnetic Wireless Charger (35W) for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: - This is one of our top picks for the best iPhone accessories. It turns any outlet into an iPhone (12 or later) holder. Our editor uses it in the kitchen to better see cooking videos. Also available directly from Twelve South. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $40 ($24 off) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Blink Outdoor 4 XR for $42 ($78 off) at Amazon: Here’s the extended range model of the Blink Outdoor cameras that we named among the best. That means you can stick it farther from your house and still see the goings on your property. Like most security cameras, you’ll get more out of it with a subscription (smart motion detections, cloud storage, and longer live views). Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds for $43 ($37 off) at Amazon: Here’s our top pick for affordable earbuds in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. They have a warm, pleasant sound and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Anker Prime GaN Charger (100W, 3-port) for $42 ($28 off) at Anker: Here’s a variant of the top pick for travel in our fast charger guide. This higher-wattage Prime charger can charge three devices at once (two via USB-C and one via Type A). Plus the prongs fold down. Perfect for keeping everything topped off on the road. Note that the discount comes courtesy of an auto-applied code. Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $43 ($13 off) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Moft Sit-stand Laptop Desk for $48 ($12 off with Prime) at Amazon: It’s a little heavy at two pounds, but it folds down flat and will turn any desk into a standing desk — elevating your laptop to elbow height or thereabouts so you can switch up your working position wherever you are. It’s surprisingly stable and one of our picks for the best MacBook accessories. UGreen Uno GaN fast charger (100W, 4-port) for $48 ($12 off) at Amazon: This is a larger version of the cute, fast charger with the built-in digital smiley face. It’s also a top pick in our guide to fast chargers. It has four ports, a max output of 100 watts and the magnetic feet still stick to anything ferrous. Blink Outdoor 2K+ for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: Amazon released a batch of new smart security cameras alongside new Echo devices in September. And here they are already on sale. Ain’t Cyber Monday grand? We’re in the process of testing this one out for our security cameras guide. But for now just know that these weather-resistant boxes can shoot 2K video, a resolution bump from the 1080p of the previous model. It has color low-light vision, two-way talk and 4x zoom. The prior model is on sale for $28. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: We haven’t officially tested doorbell cameras just yet (it’s on the list). But Ring is one of the best-known and most popular brands you can buy. This one runs on batteries so you don’t have to mess with doorbell wires and it supports two-way talk, live view and smart alerts. Just note that many features are tied to a Ring subscription ($5 to $20 per month). Ring Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam) for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: This weather-resistant outdoor cam has a removable and rechargeable battery that can go for a few months on a charge. We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: This is the most giftable of the Alexa speakers. I got one for my mom. It has a small screen to display the time, weather and what song is playing, while the Alexa+ smarts inside keep track of timers and reminders, answers questions and controls connected smart home devices with a fairly high level of competence. Ultimate Ears Miniroll Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. This is the smallest of the UE portable speakers and fits in the palm of your hand or clips to your handlebars (with its hookable strap). It'll go for 12 hours on a charge and supports a 40-meter Bluetooth range. Best Cyber Monday streaming deals under $50 HBO Max with ads (one year) for $36 ($96 off): HBO has been around a lot longer than Apple TV, and it’s got a treasure trove of winners — The Sopranos, The Wire, Veep, Insecure, Girls, Deadwood — with its back catalogue alone, you’ll never run out of high quality entertainment. Plus it has a huge movie library and quite a few current shows that are pretty good, too (The Last of Us and The Chair Company come to mind). Note that the deal applies to the ad-supported tier and will auto-renew after a year unless you cancel. You can get the deal through HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber, you can get the deal as an add-on to your service. Paramount+ Essential or Premium (2 months) for $6 ($20 or $10 off): This deal applies to either the Premium or Essential tier — both are just $6 for two months of service (or $3 monthly). The Premium plan is the better deal as it’s usually $13 per month, doesn’t have ads, includes Showtime and allows downloads for offline viewing. Of course, whichever tier you choose will hop back up to the full price after two months unless you cancel (which is $13 per month for Premium and $8 per month for ad-supported Essential). Starz (one year) for $12 ($50 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Starz annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Also available as a Hulu add-on.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-deals-under-50-apple-airtags-legos-ugreen-chargers-blink-cameras-and-more-210050294.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Cyber Monday, in all its discount-laden glory has officially arrived. If you're not among the sliver of the population dropping $7,000 on all new appliances for your kitchen, you can shop here and get a whole gaggle of electronics for less than $50 a pop. This list is composed of those smaller yet infinitely useful gadgets and accessories that keep your TV, tablet, laptop and phones all working and charged up properly. There are even a few items here that are primary players, not just sidekicks, such as smart speakers, Lego sets and a surprisingly popular pill shaver. A few streaming subs for less than $50 are also on sale. Here are the best Engadget-recommended gadgets that are on sale for Cyber Monday. Cyber Monday deals under $50: Engadget's top picks HBO Max with ads (one year) for $36 ($96 off): HBO has been around a lot longer than Apple TV, and it’s got a treasure trove of winners — The Sopranos, The Wire, Veep, Insecure, Girls, Deadwood — with its back catalogue alone, you’ll never run out of high quality entertainment. Plus it has a huge movie library and quite a few current shows that are pretty good, too (The Last of Us and The Chair Company come to mind). Note that the deal applies to the ad-supported tier and will auto-renew after a year unless you cancel. You can get the deal through HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber, you can get the deal as an add-on to your service. Paramount+ Essential or Premium (2 months) for $6 ($20 or $10 off): This deal applies to either the Premium or Essential tier — both are just $6 for two months of service (or $3 monthly). The Premium plan is the better deal as it’s usually $13 per month, doesn’t have ads, includes Showtime and allows downloads for offline viewing. Of course, whichever tier you choose will hop back up to the full price after two months unless you cancel (which is $13 per month for Premium and $8 per month for ad-supported Essential). Audible (3 months) for $3 ($42 off): As it does each Cyber Monday (and at a few points besides), Amazon is offering a near-free intro deal for its audiobook subscription. With the plan, you get one audiobook of your choice each month, which includes new and bestseller titles. You can also listen to an unlimited number of titles from a narrower library. A membership also grants access to a daily discounted title and other member-only discounts. With this deal, the plan will auto-renew at a dollar per month for three months, then default to the standard $15 monthly. So set a reminder to cancel before then if you don’t want to pay full-price. The offer ends December 1. Starz (one year) for $12 ($50 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Starz annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Also available as a Hulu add-on. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Echo Glow Multicolor smart lamp for $20 ($10 off) at Amazon: Every sales event, Amazon puts this thing on sale. And every time, I contemplate buying it. Engadget hasn’t tested it, but we’ve tried enough Amazon hardware to know it probably does what it’s supposed to do — which is pair with an Alexa speaker and light up according to your instructions. That's it. Is that worth $30? Probably not. But maybe it’s worth $20? Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger (10K mAh, 30W) for $30 ($15 off) at Amazon: I love this sleek little box. First and foremost, it’s a 10K mAh power bank (enough to refill a phone 1.5 to two times). But it also has a built-in USB-C cable (so you’ll never be without one) and flip-up wall prongs so it can refill directly from the wall (it even supports pass-through charging). Also available directly from Anker. Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and they work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app. That means, if you too are a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants, you can ask one of them to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 previously. Also at B&H Photo. Best Cyber Monday deals under $15 Anker USB-C Cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off) at Amazon: If you just need a reliable and long charger for your phone, pick this one up while it’s just $9. It can shuttle 100 watts to your handset and, in our experience, Anker cables are plenty durable — plus its red! This can handle data transfers in a pinch, but is limited to 480 Mbps. Anker SD memory Card Reader (USB-C, SD and microSD) for $9 ($9 off): This might be an ideal representative of an Anker product: A simple, moderately-priced solution that just works. I needed an SD card reader with a USB-C connection. I bought this one. It works. I’m happy. Anker USB-C Cable (240W, 10ft) for $12 ($5 off) at Amazon: If you’re sick of the sub-par, half-broken, super-short cables occupying your junk drawer, just grab a couple of these. With the max power delivery possible for USB-C at 240W, it’ll always be ready to charge anything. Just note, this is better for charging as its data transfer rates max out at 480 Mbps. Also available directly from Anker. Anker Nano 3 Charger Block (30W, 1-port) for $11 ($9 off) at Amazon: Black and white are such boring colors for charming accessories, but alas, those basic colors happen to be the ones getting the bigger discount in this deal (the pretty purple, blue and green colors are $1 more). This compact block is our pick for a great iPhone accessory. Its 30 watts of power will reup your handset stat. Philips Fabric Shaver for $13 ($7 off) at Amazon: Did you know you needed a fabric shaver? You need a fabric shaver. Our editor grabbed this one (at full price) and loves it. It keeps blankets, sweaters and joggers pill free and looking fresh for just $13. Anker Nano 3 Charger (30W, 1-port) for $13 ($5 off) at Amazon: This tiny and colorful block is one of our favorite fast chargers for 2025. It’ll send up to 30 watts of power to whatever you plug into it. That’s more than enough to fast-charge any smartphone and plenty of juice for your tablets. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Belkin Secure Holder for Apple AirTag for $14 ($6 off): This is one of our recommendations in our guide to AirTag accessories. The braided wire attachment makes it extra strong and secure. We think it’s an ideal way to create a luggage tag for your AirTag. A four-pack is on sale too. Bellemonde Kent Paper Screen Protector for iPad (2-pack) for $9 ($9 off with Prime) at Amazon: We named this paper-esque screen protector one of the best iPad accessories for 2025. I put one on my iPad a couple years ago and have been happy ever since. It creates a satisfying texture for the Apple Pencil and it adds a matte, but perfectly clear, finish to the screen. Just be sure to double check you’re grabbing the right size for your particular iPad model. Spigen for iPhone 17 Case for $13 ($3 off with Prime) at Amazon: It seems a shame to cover up the pretty colors of the new iPhones. But leaving your handset naked is just panic-inducing. We recommend this clear case from Spigen in our accessories guide. I have one on my iPhone 16 and it has kept it safe through many a fumble. Best Cyber Monday deals under $20 Roku Streaming Stick HD for $16 ($14 off) at Roku: After testing most of the smart TV interfaces out there, Roku’s is still my favorite. I like the colorful Roku City that shows up after a long pause and the navigation is intuitive. This stick will grant streaming abilities to a basic TV. There’s no 4K or other fancy video support, but if all you need is a way to stream, this will do. Also at Amazon. Lego Creator 3 in 1 Retro Camera Toy for $16 ($4 off) at Amazon: This three-in-one set builds a retro camera complete with pressable buttons, a wrist strap and loadable (Lego) film. It can also be built as a retro TV set or a camcorder. For ages eight and up. Glocusent Tri-head Clip On Book Light for $16 ($10 off) at Glocusent: My family vies for this handy device each night. It’s ideal for reading a book in bed with a light that lets you adjust the warmth, angle and spread of the beam. It’s also great for shining some light on a desk as you can use its clip like a stand. Samsung SmartTags 2 Bluetooth tracker for $16 ($13 off) at Amazon: If you’ve got a Samsung phone, the brand’s own trackers will serve you well. They’re one of the best-looking fobs we tested. It hooks up with Samsung’s own finding network, which is surprisingly robust, and was able to locate lost stuff nearly as quickly as AirTags in our tests. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants for $18 ($5 off) at Amazon: Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on their windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart. Apple AirTag Bluetooth tracker for $18 ($11 off) at Amazon: An updated version of Apple’s little finding discs is almost certainly on the horizon. For now, an AirTag is our pick for the best Bluetooth tracker for iPhone users. It’s a little quieter than third party tags like Chipolo, but when it comes to trackers, this is what most people think of. Also at Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: If you just want the Amazon Fire TV experience for the fewest dollars possible, here you go. The HD stick is the best budget option in our opinion and could be all you need if your TV doesn’t support 4K content anyway. Blink Mini 2 indoor security camera for $18 ($22 off) at Amazon: Do you wonder what the dog and cat do when you’re gone? (The answer is sleep.) An indoor camera lets you keep an eye on your home while you’re gone or just in the other room. We named the Blink Mini 2 the best budget pick in our guide to security cameras for 2025. The tiny squares are easy to set up, work well (and only) with Alexa and deliver suitable (but not ultra high quality) images. Anker Nano fast charger block (45W, 1 port) for $18 ($17 off) at Amazon: This is just about the max power you can get out of a tiny block like this. Anker’s 45-watt charger is more than enough oomph for phones and tablets, and can even handle a laptop refill in a pinch. The little plug prongs fold down and it even comes with a six-foot USB-C cable. Tofu Press by Tofuture for $19 ($4 off with on-page coupon) at Amazon: There are plenty of tofu presses out there. But this one won us over with its simplicity, cute looks and clever design that handily clears out the water from any standard tofu brick. It makes a great gift for anyone who likes to cook. Also at Tofuture with code K0Q33KF6FC01. Kasa Outdoor Smart Plug (dual socket) for $19 ($8 off) at Amazon: Tired of turning off your outdoor holiday lights manually each night? Get one of these and schedule the controls. Or better yet, let Alexa, Siri or the Google Assistant turn them off with just a command. This is the one we recommend in our guide to smart plugs — and the one that faithfully controlled my Halloween lights last month. It’s gone as low as $17 in the past. Baseus Picogo MagSafe Power Bank (5K mAh, 10W) for $19 ($8 off with Prime) at Amazon: We tested a newer version of this MagSafe bank for our battery guide. It’s Qi-certified (not Qi2) so you won’t get top charging speeds out of it. But if you need a partial refill for a phone, $19 is hard to beat. TP-Link AC1200 WiFi extender for $19 (37 percent off) at Amazon: If you’ve got some dead spots in your home’s internet coverage and aren’t quite ready for a mesh setup, a Wi-Fi extender can help. This is our favorite budget option in our guide to these plug-in devices thanks to its easy setup and user-friendly app. Echo Glow Multicolor smart lamp for $20 ($10 off) at Amazon: Every sales event, Amazon puts this thing on sale. And every time, I contemplate buying it. Engadget hasn’t tested it, but we’ve tried enough Amazon hardware to know it probably does what it’s supposed to do — which is pair with an Alexa speaker and light up according to your instructions. That's it. Is that worth $30? Probably not. But maybe it’s worth $20? Roku Streaming Stick 4K Plus for $20 ($20 off) at Roku: I called this streaming stick perfect for travel in my review. It powers itself from your TV so you don’t have to hunt for a wall outlet in your hotel room. Plus you can bring all your streaming subscriptions with you — or just enjoy Roku’s dizzying amount of free content. Also at Amazon. Best Cyber Monday deals under $25 Amazon Echo Pop Alexa Smart Speaker for $22 ($18 off) at Amazon: Amazon’s smallest smart speaker isn’t focused so much on sound quality as it is on putting Alexa+ wherever you may need the assistant’s help. Use the little half sphere to control your connected lights, give you the weather or just have an “interesting” conversation. Last year, it dropped as low as $18 and certain colorways look to be sold out. Kasa Smart Plug Matter Compatible KP125M (2-pack) for $23 ($12 off) at Amazon: If you want to control your lamps, humidifiers and other simple appliances just by talking to your home assistant of choice, a smart plug will let you do so. We deemed this the top pick for a Matter-enabled plug in our smart plug guide. Set-up is seamless and it supports Siri, Alexa, the Google Assistant and more. LEGO Creator 3-in-1 Retro Telephone for kids for $24 ($6 off) at Amazon: One of our top picks for the best tech toys for kids is on sale for Cyber Monday. This cute-as-a-button retro telephone is rated for kids eight and older and is a three-in-one set that can be rebuilt into three different configurations: A rotary phone, cordless phone and an early-days cell phone/flip phone combo. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $23 ($6 off) at Amazon: After testing all the Bluetooth trackers I could get my hands on, I think this is the best finding fob out there. Yes, even better than an AirTag; It's louder, can ring your phone and works on the same massive Find My network as AirTags do. And for Android users, it'll work with Google's Find Hub. Check out Engadget’s guide to Bluetooth trackers for more thoughts. Also available directly from Chipolo. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 ($25 off) at Amazon: We don’t know why Amazon needs so many streaming sticks in its lineup, but here we are. The 4K Plus is very similar to the 4K Max except it has a little less storage at 8GB and no Wi-Fi 6E (just Wi-Fi 6). You also don’t get the Ambient experience that turns your TV into art. If you can swing the extra bucks, go for the Max, but if those features don’t matter to you, this saves you $10 right now. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off) at Roku: The difference between this streamer and the newer 4K Plus is that one doesn’t have Dolby vision or an extended Wi-Fi range — this one does. So if you need that extra range and/or have a TV that supports Dolby Vision, this is the Roku stick to get. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $24 ($5 off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Best Cyber Monday deals under $35 Twelve South AirFly SE Bluetooth Audio Transmitter for $26 ($14 off) at Amazon: If you (or someone on your gift list) travels by plane a lot, they might appreciate this dongle. It adds a Bluetooth connection to any 3.5mm aux audio jack so they can use their AirPods or other wireless buds to watch in-flight entertainment. $26 isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen (it went as low as $16 earlier this year). Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off) at Amazon with Prime: Share your good taste in music with Anker’s portable sound box. It’s Bluetooth connected, goes for 24 hours on a charge and can handle a dunk in water with no ill effects to its 12 watts of sound. Soundcore makes a few of the picks on our list of the best speakers — this is a more affordable model. Also available directly from Anker and at Best Buy. EarFun Free 2S Wireless Earbuds for $28 ($12 off) at Amazon: These are the ultra-budget pick in our guide to budget earbuds. They don’t have ANC, but the sound is lively and the fit is comfortable. You aren’t getting the highest sound quality here, but if you need a knock around pair, these will do. JBL Go 3 Mini Bluetooth Speaker for $30 ($10 off) at Amazon: For about two dollars more than the all-time low, you can grab this pocket-sized speaker from JBL. It’s the previous model of a pick from our guide to Bluetooth speakers. It goes for 5 hours on a charge and is $10 cheaper than the Go 4. Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Baseus Picogo magnetic portable charger with stand (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: This little guy gave a solid 43 percent bump to our tester iPhone 15 in 42 minutes, ultimately charging it to 91 percent. It earned a mention in our guide to MagSafe batteries thanks to those speeds, its compact size and the handy (and sturdy) little stand on the back. Thermacell E-Series Rechargeable Mosquito Repeller for $30 ($20 off) at Amazon: As winter hits, the mosquitos give up the war to claim the backyard for themselves. But they’ll be back. This is a variant of the mosquito repeller we recommend in our guide to outdoor gear. This one has a 20-foot coverage area and sports a built-in light. Amazon Echo Dot Alexa smart speaker for $32 ($18 off) at Amazon: This is Amazon’s most popular Echo device and it’s the one my family uses most. The new Alexa+ is more conversational and can remember conversations and apply context. It’s still a work in progress, but can set timers, tell you the weather and control your smart home like a champ. It sold for as low as $23 last year. Amazon Echo Dot Kids for $32 ($28 off) at Amazon: The difference between the kids model and the standard Echo Dot is the cute cover (this one looks like an inverted planetarium) and a free year of access to Amazon Kids+, which includes audio books, games and other content for kids aged three to twelve. Just note, you’ll get more out of the subscription with an Amazon device with a screen and the subscription will automatically renew (at $6 monthly) after a year unless you cancel. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 ($17 off with Prime) at Amazon: There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen and at Walmart. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB C Hub for $34 ($20 off with Prime) at Amazon: I tested a bunch of USB-C hubs and deemed this one the best. Plug in the generously long cable into your tablet or laptop and you’ll be able to read memory cards, use USB-A peripherals, connect a 4K monitor via HDMI and use Ethernet. The lowest price we tracked on this guy yet is $30. Anker Nano Charger Block (70W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: This specific model isn’t in our guides, but we’ve seen other Anker Nano chargers prove themselves, so we’re comfortable recommending it. This one has two USB-C ports for fast charging devices, plus a Type-A outlet for devices that need it. Zagg Glass Elite Screen Protector for iPhone 17 for $35 ($5 off) at Amazon: You’re thinking of saying yes to the new iPhone 17. You probably won’t be disappointed. Just make sure you protect it. We like Zagg’s shields and said so in our guide to iPhone accessories. Also available at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) at Amazon: We recently wondered why Amazon needs so many streaming devices (Google just has one and it’s our favorite). But in the battle among the Fire TV streamers, we think this one is the best. It can display 4K resolution and Dolby Video, supports the more future-proof Wi-Fi 6E, has more memory than the other sticks and lets you use the Ambient Experience that displays art on your screen when you’re not watching The Expanse. Anker Prime GaN wall charger (67W, 3-port) for $35 ($15 off) at Amazon: Travelers, take note. This is what we recommend to those on a journey in our guide to fast chargers. It has three ports, and can detect which plugged-in device is in most need of a refill. The 67-watt rating is all you need for phones and tablets and will even top off most laptops if needed. Also available directly from Anker. Best Cyber Monday deals under $50 Leebein Electric Spin Scrubber for $36 ($34 off with Prime) at Amazon: Shower scrubbing is no one’s favorite activity (I’m assuming here, but I’m pretty sure I’m right). This makes the job so very much easier. Discovered by our editor who abhors the task, the Leebein runs on a USB-C rechargeable battery and has swappable brushes. The course brush combined with the higher speed is no match for any shower scum. Anker 555 USB-C Hub (8-in-1) for $36 ($14 off) at Amazon: This was almost our top pick for the best USB-C hub, but a UGreen model edged it out. But the 555 is still great with ports that include HDMI, Ethernet, two USB Type A, a power delivery USB-C and a USB-C 3.2. That should be enough to keep any tablet or laptop suitably connected. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Kasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack) for $37 ($13 off) at Amazon: In my house, we call these “the good plugs.” The connection is fast and fuss-free and it’ll work with Alexa, Siri, OK Google and via the Kasa app — so if you’re a smart home mad scientist with multiple home assistants you can ask one to turn on the lamp and another helper to turn it off. This is the best smart plug we tested. The four-pack went as low as $30 is the lowest price we’ve tracked. Also at B&H Photo. Anker Nano Ultra Slim power bank (5K mAh, Qi2 15W) for $39 ($17 off) at Amazon: This super slim bank pairs nicely with an iPhone Air, or any MagSafe-compatible iPhone for that matter. It’s more affordable than Apple’s version and a top pick in our MagSafe battery guide. Twelve South PowerBug Qi2 Magnetic Wireless Charger (35W) for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: - This is one of our top picks for the best iPhone accessories. It turns any outlet into an iPhone (12 or later) holder. Our editor uses it in the kitchen to better see cooking videos. Also available directly from Twelve South. JBL Go 4 Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $40 ($10 off) at Amazon: Our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers ranks the Go 4 as one of the winners. It’s super compact at less than half a pound — so don’t expect top-end sound — but it outputs good volume for its size and even has a handy carry loop. Also available directly from JBL and at Walmart. Sharge AeroMag Magsafe Power Bank (Qi2 15W, 5K mAh) for $40 ($24 off) at Amazon: To recharge a dying iPhone (12 and later) in the most unobtrusive way possible, go for a MagSafe power bank. It’s not as fast as a wired connection, but super convenient. After testing Sharge’s AeroMag, it earned a runner-up spot in our guide. Blink Outdoor 4 XR for $42 ($78 off) at Amazon: Here’s the extended range model of the Blink Outdoor cameras that we named among the best. That means you can stick it farther from your house and still see the goings on your property. Like most security cameras, you’ll get more out of it with a subscription (smart motion detections, cloud storage, and longer live views). Anker Soundcore Space A40 wireless earbuds for $43 ($37 off) at Amazon: Here’s our top pick for affordable earbuds in our guide to the best budget wireless earbuds. They have a warm, pleasant sound and surprisingly good noise cancellation for the price. Also available directly from Anker and at Walmart. Anker Prime GaN Charger (100W, 3-port) for $42 ($28 off) at Anker: Here’s a variant of the top pick for travel in our fast charger guide. This higher-wattage Prime charger can charge three devices at once (two via USB-C and one via Type A). Plus the prongs fold down. Perfect for keeping everything topped off on the road. Note that the discount comes courtesy of an auto-applied code. Ugreen Nexode Pro GaN slim wall charger (65W 3-port) for $43 ($13 off) at Amazon: In the battle for fast charger supremacy, UGreen’s flatish block got a nod for being pretty good at its job. It has three USB outputs, including one Type-A for your more retro electronics and can pump out up to 65W for phones and tablets, or even laptops if needed. Just note the flat-but-wide design could block other outlets. Also available directly from UGreen and at Best Buy. Moft Sit-stand Laptop Desk for $48 ($12 off with Prime) at Amazon: It’s a little heavy at two pounds, but it folds down flat and will turn any desk into a standing desk — elevating your laptop to elbow height or thereabouts so you can switch up your working position wherever you are. It’s surprisingly stable and one of our picks for the best MacBook accessories. UGreen Uno GaN fast charger (100W, 4-port) for $48 ($12 off) at Amazon: This is a larger version of the cute, fast charger with the built-in digital smiley face. It’s also a top pick in our guide to fast chargers. It has four ports, a max output of 100 watts and the magnetic feet still stick to anything ferrous. Blink Outdoor 2K+ for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: Amazon released a batch of new smart security cameras alongside new Echo devices in September. And here they are already on sale. Ain’t Cyber Monday grand? We’re in the process of testing this one out for our security cameras guide. But for now just know that these weather-resistant boxes can shoot 2K video, a resolution bump from the 1080p of the previous model. It has color low-light vision, two-way talk and 4x zoom. The prior model is on sale for $28. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: We haven’t officially tested doorbell cameras just yet (it’s on the list). But Ring is one of the best-known and most popular brands you can buy. This one runs on batteries so you don’t have to mess with doorbell wires and it supports two-way talk, live view and smart alerts. Just note that many features are tied to a Ring subscription ($5 to $20 per month). Ring Outdoor Cam (Stick Up Cam) for $50 ($50 off) at Amazon: This weather-resistant outdoor cam has a removable and rechargeable battery that can go for a few months on a charge. We didn’t test this exact model for our security cam guide, but other Ring cameras worked well for us. Here you get live views, color night vision, two-way talk and motion alerts. Just note that it only works with Alexa and some features require a subscription. Amazon Echo Spot for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: This is the most giftable of the Alexa speakers. I got one for my mom. It has a small screen to display the time, weather and what song is playing, while the Alexa+ smarts inside keep track of timers and reminders, answers questions and controls connected smart home devices with a fairly high level of competence. Ultimate Ears Miniroll Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker for $50 ($30 off) at Amazon: Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. This is the smallest of the UE portable speakers and fits in the palm of your hand or clips to your handlebars (with its hookable strap). It'll go for 12 hours on a charge and supports a 40-meter Bluetooth range. Best Cyber Monday streaming deals under $50 HBO Max with ads (one year) for $36 ($96 off): HBO has been around a lot longer than Apple TV, and it’s got a treasure trove of winners — The Sopranos, The Wire, Veep, Insecure, Girls, Deadwood — with its back catalogue alone, you’ll never run out of high quality entertainment. Plus it has a huge movie library and quite a few current shows that are pretty good, too (The Last of Us and The Chair Company come to mind). Note that the deal applies to the ad-supported tier and will auto-renew after a year unless you cancel. You can get the deal through HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber, you can get the deal as an add-on to your service. Paramount+ Essential or Premium (2 months) for $6 ($20 or $10 off): This deal applies to either the Premium or Essential tier — both are just $6 for two months of service (or $3 monthly). The Premium plan is the better deal as it’s usually $13 per month, doesn’t have ads, includes Showtime and allows downloads for offline viewing. Of course, whichever tier you choose will hop back up to the full price after two months unless you cancel (which is $13 per month for Premium and $8 per month for ad-supported Essential). Starz (one year) for $12 ($50 off): Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Starz annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. Also available as a Hulu add-on.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/cyber-monday-deals-under-50-apple-airtags-legos-ugreen-chargers-blink-cameras-and-more-210050294.html?src=rss",

          "title": "The Disney+ Hulu bundle drops to $5 per month for one year during Cyber Monday",
          "standfirst": "The Disney+ and Hulu (with ads) bundle is officially on sale for $5 per month for one year (for a total of $60) through the end of the day Cyber Monday, giving new and returning subscribers a full year of both streaming platforms for less than the cost of a few movie tickets. The bundle includes Disney+ and Hulu’s basic plans with ads, so if you’ve been waiting for a sign to catch up on Only Murders in the Building or dive into the Star Wars universe, this is it. But today is the last day to get it, as the offer expires at the end of the day December 1. Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases. For families, it doubles as a reliable destination for animated favorites, from Encanto to Inside Out 2, and its kid-friendly interface makes it simple to hand over the remote without worrying about what’s queued next. Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like The Bear, The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders in the Building, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV. The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content. Both platforms also integrate smoothly across devices. Disney+ is available on nearly every smart TV and streaming stick and Hulu’s interface is built around customizable profiles, so everyone in the household can keep separate watch lists. The bundle login works seamlessly between the two, and since they’re both owned by Disney, it’s easy to switch from a Marvel marathon to a new episode of The Great or Abbott Elementary without leaving the ecosystem. If you prefer a more premium experience, you can upgrade to the Duo Premium bundle for ad-free viewing, but the Basic plan remains the best value for most users. It’s an especially practical pick if you’re looking to consolidate your streaming subscriptions without losing access to major franchises or hit series. If you’re still comparing options or thinking about how to simplify your lineup, our guide to the best streaming services outlines how Disney+, Hulu and others stack up. But for those already invested in Disney’s worlds or Hulu’s critically acclaimed originals, this annual Duo Basic deal offers one of the easiest and most affordable ways to keep it all in one place. There are plenty of other Cyber Monday streaming deals to consider as well. Here are some of the best ones: Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Cyber Monday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. HBO Max — one year for $36: HBO Max's Cyber Monday deal gives subscribers one year streaming for $36 through December 1. This Cyber Monday streaming deal is on the ad-supported option, which normally goes for $11 per month. With this discount, you're getting it for $3 per month for one year. You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Paramount+ — two months of Essential or Premium for $6: This Cyber Monday deal brings the monthly price of either Paramount+ tier down to just $6 for two months, or $3 per month. The obvious better deal is on the Premium plan, which typically costs $13 per month. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year.

          "standfirst": "So you have a strict budget to stick to this year when it comes to Cyber Monday shopping — you’re not alone. Money’s tight all around, but you still want to take advantage of all the Cyber Monday deals out there and cross some gifts off your list and pick up a few things for yourself. It’s not an impossible task, and yes, some of the best tech of the year can fit into your budget. Cyber Monday tech deals this year have brought a slew of discounts to some of our favorites, and a number of them fall under the $100 mark thanks to the sales. Here, we’ve curated the best Cyber Monday deals on tech you can get for $100 or less so you don’t have to go searching for them. Best Cyber Monday deals for $100 or less Apple AirTags (four pack) for $63 (36 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Audible — three months for $3 + $20 Audible credit: For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): Getting into the smart home space can seem daunting, but opting for a small but powerful device like the Amazon Smart Plug can make it much easier. It's one of our favorite smart plugs because it's almost entirely plug-and-play. It's super simple to set up and then you can control almost anything you plug into it with Alexa voice commands or mobile app. The only caveat is that it only supports Alexa voice control, making it the best option for those who already use Amazon's voice assistant often. Starz — one year for $12: Pay upfront for one year and you can get more than $50 off a Stars annual subscription. There's a month-to-month option too, which costs $3 per month for the first three months if you don't want to commit to the full year. Either option gives you access to the entire Starz TV and movie library with offline viewing and no ads. LEGO Botanicals Happy Plants Building Toys 10349 for $18 (20 percent off): Here’s an ideal Secret Santa gift — everyone loves Legos and these cheery little guys will keep your giftee company at their desk or on a windowsill, and are the lowest-maintenance plants around. Also at Target and Walmart; it's one of many Lego Cyber Monday deals you can get right now. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 (52 percent off): This is one of the best Roku devices to get if you're on a budget and just want to make an aging TV set feel a little bit newer. This model supports 4K HDR content, has pretty accurate universal search and gives you access to a ton of free content to watch via Roku's streaming OS. Apple TV+ — 6 months for $36: Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Cyber Monday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less.

You can sign up via HBO Max's website or, if you're a Prime Video subscriber already, via that service as an add-on. Twelve South AirFly SE Bluetooth Audio Transmitter for $26 ($14 off): If you (or someone on your gift list) travels by plane a lot, they might appreciate this dongle. It adds a Bluetooth connection to any 3.5mm aux audio jack so they can use their AirPods or other wireless buds to watch in-flight entertainment. $26 isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen (it went as low as $16 earlier this year). Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). DJI Mic Mini wireless lav mic for $66 (45 percent off): Content creators or anyone who just needs higher quality audio in the videos they make will want a wireless microphone like the DJI Mic Mini. Its lightweight and easily attaches to almost anything via clips or magnets, and it pairs easily with smartphones and cameras via Bluetooth. You can also get a configuration that includes a charging case for $80. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. Samsung P9 microSD Express card (512GB) for $75 (25 percent off): There are only a handful of microSD Express cards on the market right now, and they are the type you need if you want to expand the storage on your new Switch 2. After testing a bunch of these cards to find the best microSD Express card for Switch 2, our biggest takeaway was that most of the ones on the market right now work well and you should get the capacity you want at the cheapest price you can find. This is a great deal on a 512GB card, and there are other Cyber Monday deals on 256GB cards, too. Google TV Streamer 4K for $75 ($25 off): Our top pick for the best streaming device right now, the latest version of Google's streamer supports 4K video and an excellent, easy-to-use interface that will feel familiar to anyone who's seen a set with the Google TV technology built in. It provides access to all of the major streaming services including Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, YouTube and more, plus it has a handy on-screen pop up that lets you control all compatible smart home devices right from your TV. Amazon Kindle for $80 ($25 off): Amazon's entry-level Kindle is the best budget e-reader on the market right now, with a compact and durable design, plus a crisp display. If you already have a bunch of ebooks purchased through the Kindle Store, it's one of the best options for you, and Amazon's Whispersync feature lines up where you are in the e-printed version with the narration if you go back and forth between reading and listening to Audible audiobooks. Anker Laptop Power Bank (25K, 100W) for $88 (35 percent off): A top pick in our guide to the best power banks, this Anker brick is kind of a one-and-done device. It has enough capacity to charge all sorts of devices from smartphones to laptops to handheld gaming consoles, and it has two built-in USB-C cables so you don't even have to remember to bring your own to use it. Also available at Anker.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-cyber-monday-deals-for-100-or-less-score-big-discounts-on-apple-anker-streaming-services-and-more-080046748.html?src=rss",

For Cyber Monday, you can get a four-pack of Apple's AirTags for $63 at both Amazon and Walmart. That's a record low price for one of the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhones, lowering an individual tracker's price in the bundle from $29 down to $16. If you use Apple devices and are prone to losing stuff, AirTags are the obvious choice of Bluetooth tracker to buy. Adding one to your account requires little more than a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network offering such extensive coverage these days, it’s never been easier to find missing belongings. Tracking down a still nearby misplaced item is as easy as using your iPhone to trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively you can use Precision Finding to pinpoint its location through Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone’s screen, paying attention to its vibrations as you get closer. If you only need a single AirTag, they’re also on sale right now for $18, another record low. It works out a bit better as a deal if you purchase the four-pack, but if you just want to attach one to your keys or backpack, $65 might seem like a stretch. Just remember that AirTags can’t be attached to items right out of the box. You’ll need to add an accessory in order to turn one into a keyring, or even attach it to your pet’s collar.

          "standfirst": "Apple’s new AirPods Pro 3 are already shaping up to be one of the most sought-after tech gifts this season, and now you can grab them at a lower price. They’re on sale for $220, down from the regular $249. Previously, the lowest we’ve seen the AirPods Pro 3 discounted to is $239. If you’ve been holding off on upgrading your earbuds, this is the deal worth grabbing. Apple didn’t reinvent its flagship earbuds with the AirPods Pro 3, but it made smart refinements that elevate nearly every part of the listening experience. We praised these earbuds in our AirPods Pro 3 review for delivering noticeably richer audio and more effective active noise cancellation while keeping the same pocketable form factor that made earlier models so popular. The standout upgrade here is Apple’s Live Translation feature, which was an unexpected but welcome surprise, announced at the iPhone 17 event. Leveraging Apple’s H2 chip, the AirPods Pro 3 combines Voice Isolation, ANC and beamforming mics to kick Live Translation into action. Siri’s translation filters seamlessly through the earbuds, but if environmental noise gets too intrusive, you can view a real-time transcription in the iOS Translate app, which is a useful feature for international travel and business calls. Battery life has improved, too. You get up to eight hours on a single charge with ANC on, and the case adds another 24 hours of playback. The MagSafe charging case, with its new U2 chip, now supports an increased distance for Precision Find My, so it’s easier to locate if misplaced. Since we’re talking about earbuds, audio quality plays a key role in deciding whether to purchase the AirPods Pro 3 or upgrade from a previous model. Although improvements have been made to sound quality through new drivers and transducers, Apple’s decision to increase air flow inside the earbuds has been the most noticeable update. You can expect the AirPods Pro 3 to deliver deeper bass, crisper highs, and an expanded soundstage that makes everything from podcasts to orchestral tracks feel more dynamic. There’s not much to fault here beyond the familiar Apple premium price, but that’s why this AirPods Pro 3 deal is such good news. The AirPods Pro 3 remain the best wireless earbuds for iPhone users who want seamless connectivity, top-tier ANC and reliable comfort. Elsewhere when it comes to Cyber Monday AirPod deals, the AirPods 4 with ANC are down to $99.

          "title": "DeepSeek just dropped two insanely powerful AI models that rival GPT-5 and they're totally free",
          "standfirst": "Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek released two powerful new AI models on Sunday that the company claims match or exceed the capabilities of OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5 and Google&#x27;s Gemini-3.0-Pro — a development that could reshape the competitive landscape between American tech giants and their Chinese challengers.The Hangzhou-based company launched DeepSeek-V3.2, designed as an everyday reasoning assistant, alongside DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, a high-powered variant that achieved gold-medal performance in four elite international competitions: the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad, the International Olympiad in Informatics, the ICPC World Finals, and the China Mathematical Olympiad.The release carries profound implications for American technology leadership. DeepSeek has once again demonstrated that it can produce frontier AI systems despite U.S. export controls that restrict China&#x27;s access to advanced Nvidia chips — and it has done so while making its models freely available under an open-source MIT license.\"People thought DeepSeek gave a one-time breakthrough but we came back much bigger,\" wrote Chen Fang, who identified himself as a contributor to the project, on X (formerly Twitter). The release drew swift reactions online, with one user declaring: \"Rest in peace, ChatGPT.\"How DeepSeek&#x27;s sparse attention breakthrough slashes computing costsAt the heart of the new release lies DeepSeek Sparse Attention, or DSA — a novel architectural innovation that dramatically reduces the computational burden of running AI models on long documents and complex tasks.Traditional AI attention mechanisms, the core technology allowing language models to understand context, scale poorly as input length increases. Processing a document twice as long typically requires four times the computation. DeepSeek&#x27;s approach breaks this constraint using what the company calls a \"lightning indexer\" that identifies only the most relevant portions of context for each query, ignoring the rest.According to DeepSeek&#x27;s technical report, DSA reduces inference costs by roughly half compared to previous models when processing long sequences. The architecture \"substantially reduces computational complexity while preserving model performance,\" the report states.Processing 128,000 tokens — roughly equivalent to a 300-page book — now costs approximately $0.70 per million tokens for decoding, compared to $2.40 for the previous V3.1-Terminus model. That represents a 70% reduction in inference costs.The 685-billion-parameter models support context windows of 128,000 tokens, making them suitable for analyzing lengthy documents, codebases, and research papers. DeepSeek&#x27;s technical report notes that independent evaluations on long-context benchmarks show V3.2 performing on par with or better than its predecessor \"despite incorporating a sparse attention mechanism.\"The benchmark results that put DeepSeek in the same league as GPT-5DeepSeek&#x27;s claims of parity with America&#x27;s leading AI systems rest on extensive testing across mathematics, coding, and reasoning tasks — and the numbers are striking.On AIME 2025, a prestigious American mathematics competition, DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale achieved a 96.0% pass rate, compared to 94.6% for GPT-5-High and 95.0% for Gemini-3.0-Pro. On the Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament, the Speciale variant scored 99.2%, surpassing Gemini&#x27;s 97.5%.The standard V3.2 model, optimized for everyday use, scored 93.1% on AIME and 92.5% on HMMT — marginally below frontier models but achieved with substantially fewer computational resources.Most striking are the competition results. DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale scored 35 out of 42 points on the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad, earning gold-medal status. At the International Olympiad in Informatics, it scored 492 out of 600 points — also gold, ranking 10th overall. The model solved 10 of 12 problems at the ICPC World Finals, placing second.These results came without internet access or tools during testing. DeepSeek&#x27;s report states that \"testing strictly adheres to the contest&#x27;s time and attempt limits.\"On coding benchmarks, DeepSeek-V3.2 resolved 73.1% of real-world software bugs on SWE-Verified, competitive with GPT-5-High at 74.9%. On Terminal Bench 2.0, measuring complex coding workflows, DeepSeek scored 46.4%—well above GPT-5-High&#x27;s 35.2%.The company acknowledges limitations. \"Token efficiency remains a challenge,\" the technical report states, noting that DeepSeek \"typically requires longer generation trajectories\" to match Gemini-3.0-Pro&#x27;s output quality.Why teaching AI to think while using tools changes everythingBeyond raw reasoning, DeepSeek-V3.2 introduces \"thinking in tool-use\" — the ability to reason through problems while simultaneously executing code, searching the web, and manipulating files.Previous AI models faced a frustrating limitation: each time they called an external tool, they lost their train of thought and had to restart reasoning from scratch. DeepSeek&#x27;s architecture preserves the reasoning trace across multiple tool calls, enabling fluid multi-step problem solving.To train this capability, the company built a massive synthetic data pipeline generating over 1,800 distinct task environments and 85,000 complex instructions. These included challenges like multi-day trip planning with budget constraints, software bug fixes across eight programming languages, and web-based research requiring dozens of searches.The technical report describes one example: planning a three-day trip from Hangzhou with constraints on hotel prices, restaurant ratings, and attraction costs that vary based on accommodation choices. Such tasks are \"hard to solve but easy to verify,\" making them ideal for training AI agents.DeepSeek employed real-world tools during training — actual web search APIs, coding environments, and Jupyter notebooks — while generating synthetic prompts to ensure diversity. The result is a model that generalizes to unseen tools and environments, a critical capability for real-world deployment.DeepSeek&#x27;s open-source gambit could upend the AI industry&#x27;s business modelUnlike OpenAI and Anthropic, which guard their most powerful models as proprietary assets, DeepSeek has released both V3.2 and V3.2-Speciale under the MIT license — one of the most permissive open-source frameworks available.Any developer, researcher, or company can download, modify, and deploy the 685-billion-parameter models without restriction. Full model weights, training code, and documentation are available on Hugging Face, the leading platform for AI model sharing.The strategic implications are significant. By making frontier-capable models freely available, DeepSeek undermines competitors charging premium API prices. The Hugging Face model card notes that DeepSeek has provided Python scripts and test cases \"demonstrating how to encode messages in OpenAI-compatible format\" — making migration from competing services straightforward.For enterprise customers, the value proposition is compelling: frontier performance at dramatically lower cost, with deployment flexibility. But data residency concerns and regulatory uncertainty may limit adoption in sensitive applications — particularly given DeepSeek&#x27;s Chinese origins.Regulatory walls are rising against DeepSeek in Europe and AmericaDeepSeek&#x27;s global expansion faces mounting resistance. In June, Berlin&#x27;s data protection commissioner Meike Kamp declared that DeepSeek&#x27;s transfer of German user data to China is \"unlawful\" under EU rules, asking Apple and Google to consider blocking the app.The German authority expressed concern that \"Chinese authorities have extensive access rights to personal data within the sphere of influence of Chinese companies.\" Italy ordered DeepSeek to block its app in February. U.S. lawmakers have moved to ban the service from government devices, citing national security concerns.Questions also persist about U.S. export controls designed to limit China&#x27;s AI capabilities. In August, DeepSeek hinted that China would soon have \"next generation\" domestically built chips to support its models. The company indicated its systems work with Chinese-made chips from Huawei and Cambricon without additional setup.DeepSeek&#x27;s original V3 model was reportedly trained on roughly 2,000 older Nvidia H800 chips — hardware since restricted for China export. The company has not disclosed what powered V3.2 training, but its continued advancement suggests export controls alone cannot halt Chinese AI progress.What DeepSeek&#x27;s release means for the future of AI competitionThe release arrives at a pivotal moment. After years of massive investment, some analysts question whether an AI bubble is forming. DeepSeek&#x27;s ability to match American frontier models at a fraction of the cost challenges assumptions that AI leadership requires enormous capital expenditure.The company&#x27;s technical report reveals that post-training investment now exceeds 10% of pre-training costs — a substantial allocation credited for reasoning improvements. But DeepSeek acknowledges gaps: \"The breadth of world knowledge in DeepSeek-V3.2 still lags behind leading proprietary models,\" the report states. The company plans to address this by scaling pre-training compute.DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale remains available through a temporary API until December 15, when its capabilities will merge into the standard release. The Speciale variant is designed exclusively for deep reasoning and does not support tool calling — a limitation the standard model addresses.For now, the AI race between the United States and China has entered a new phase. DeepSeek&#x27;s release demonstrates that open-source models can achieve frontier performance, that efficiency innovations can slash costs dramatically, and that the most powerful AI systems may soon be freely available to anyone with an internet connection.As one commenter on X observed: \"Deepseek just casually breaking those historic benchmarks set by Gemini is bonkers.\"The question is no longer whether Chinese AI can compete with Silicon Valley. It&#x27;s whether American companies can maintain their lead when their Chinese rival gives comparable technology away for free.",
          "content": "Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek released two powerful new AI models on Sunday that the company claims match or exceed the capabilities of OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5 and Google&#x27;s Gemini-3.0-Pro — a development that could reshape the competitive landscape between American tech giants and their Chinese challengers.The Hangzhou-based company launched DeepSeek-V3.2, designed as an everyday reasoning assistant, alongside DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale, a high-powered variant that achieved gold-medal performance in four elite international competitions: the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad, the International Olympiad in Informatics, the ICPC World Finals, and the China Mathematical Olympiad.The release carries profound implications for American technology leadership. DeepSeek has once again demonstrated that it can produce frontier AI systems despite U.S. export controls that restrict China&#x27;s access to advanced Nvidia chips — and it has done so while making its models freely available under an open-source MIT license.\"People thought DeepSeek gave a one-time breakthrough but we came back much bigger,\" wrote Chen Fang, who identified himself as a contributor to the project, on X (formerly Twitter). The release drew swift reactions online, with one user declaring: \"Rest in peace, ChatGPT.\"How DeepSeek&#x27;s sparse attention breakthrough slashes computing costsAt the heart of the new release lies DeepSeek Sparse Attention, or DSA — a novel architectural innovation that dramatically reduces the computational burden of running AI models on long documents and complex tasks.Traditional AI attention mechanisms, the core technology allowing language models to understand context, scale poorly as input length increases. Processing a document twice as long typically requires four times the computation. DeepSeek&#x27;s approach breaks this constraint using what the company calls a \"lightning indexer\" that identifies only the most relevant portions of context for each query, ignoring the rest.According to DeepSeek&#x27;s technical report, DSA reduces inference costs by roughly half compared to previous models when processing long sequences. The architecture \"substantially reduces computational complexity while preserving model performance,\" the report states.Processing 128,000 tokens — roughly equivalent to a 300-page book — now costs approximately $0.70 per million tokens for decoding, compared to $2.40 for the previous V3.1-Terminus model. That represents a 70% reduction in inference costs.The 685-billion-parameter models support context windows of 128,000 tokens, making them suitable for analyzing lengthy documents, codebases, and research papers. DeepSeek&#x27;s technical report notes that independent evaluations on long-context benchmarks show V3.2 performing on par with or better than its predecessor \"despite incorporating a sparse attention mechanism.\"The benchmark results that put DeepSeek in the same league as GPT-5DeepSeek&#x27;s claims of parity with America&#x27;s leading AI systems rest on extensive testing across mathematics, coding, and reasoning tasks — and the numbers are striking.On AIME 2025, a prestigious American mathematics competition, DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale achieved a 96.0% pass rate, compared to 94.6% for GPT-5-High and 95.0% for Gemini-3.0-Pro. On the Harvard-MIT Mathematics Tournament, the Speciale variant scored 99.2%, surpassing Gemini&#x27;s 97.5%.The standard V3.2 model, optimized for everyday use, scored 93.1% on AIME and 92.5% on HMMT — marginally below frontier models but achieved with substantially fewer computational resources.Most striking are the competition results. DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale scored 35 out of 42 points on the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad, earning gold-medal status. At the International Olympiad in Informatics, it scored 492 out of 600 points — also gold, ranking 10th overall. The model solved 10 of 12 problems at the ICPC World Finals, placing second.These results came without internet access or tools during testing. DeepSeek&#x27;s report states that \"testing strictly adheres to the contest&#x27;s time and attempt limits.\"On coding benchmarks, DeepSeek-V3.2 resolved 73.1% of real-world software bugs on SWE-Verified, competitive with GPT-5-High at 74.9%. On Terminal Bench 2.0, measuring complex coding workflows, DeepSeek scored 46.4%—well above GPT-5-High&#x27;s 35.2%.The company acknowledges limitations. \"Token efficiency remains a challenge,\" the technical report states, noting that DeepSeek \"typically requires longer generation trajectories\" to match Gemini-3.0-Pro&#x27;s output quality.Why teaching AI to think while using tools changes everythingBeyond raw reasoning, DeepSeek-V3.2 introduces \"thinking in tool-use\" — the ability to reason through problems while simultaneously executing code, searching the web, and manipulating files.Previous AI models faced a frustrating limitation: each time they called an external tool, they lost their train of thought and had to restart reasoning from scratch. DeepSeek&#x27;s architecture preserves the reasoning trace across multiple tool calls, enabling fluid multi-step problem solving.To train this capability, the company built a massive synthetic data pipeline generating over 1,800 distinct task environments and 85,000 complex instructions. These included challenges like multi-day trip planning with budget constraints, software bug fixes across eight programming languages, and web-based research requiring dozens of searches.The technical report describes one example: planning a three-day trip from Hangzhou with constraints on hotel prices, restaurant ratings, and attraction costs that vary based on accommodation choices. Such tasks are \"hard to solve but easy to verify,\" making them ideal for training AI agents.DeepSeek employed real-world tools during training — actual web search APIs, coding environments, and Jupyter notebooks — while generating synthetic prompts to ensure diversity. The result is a model that generalizes to unseen tools and environments, a critical capability for real-world deployment.DeepSeek&#x27;s open-source gambit could upend the AI industry&#x27;s business modelUnlike OpenAI and Anthropic, which guard their most powerful models as proprietary assets, DeepSeek has released both V3.2 and V3.2-Speciale under the MIT license — one of the most permissive open-source frameworks available.Any developer, researcher, or company can download, modify, and deploy the 685-billion-parameter models without restriction. Full model weights, training code, and documentation are available on Hugging Face, the leading platform for AI model sharing.The strategic implications are significant. By making frontier-capable models freely available, DeepSeek undermines competitors charging premium API prices. The Hugging Face model card notes that DeepSeek has provided Python scripts and test cases \"demonstrating how to encode messages in OpenAI-compatible format\" — making migration from competing services straightforward.For enterprise customers, the value proposition is compelling: frontier performance at dramatically lower cost, with deployment flexibility. But data residency concerns and regulatory uncertainty may limit adoption in sensitive applications — particularly given DeepSeek&#x27;s Chinese origins.Regulatory walls are rising against DeepSeek in Europe and AmericaDeepSeek&#x27;s global expansion faces mounting resistance. In June, Berlin&#x27;s data protection commissioner Meike Kamp declared that DeepSeek&#x27;s transfer of German user data to China is \"unlawful\" under EU rules, asking Apple and Google to consider blocking the app.The German authority expressed concern that \"Chinese authorities have extensive access rights to personal data within the sphere of influence of Chinese companies.\" Italy ordered DeepSeek to block its app in February. U.S. lawmakers have moved to ban the service from government devices, citing national security concerns.Questions also persist about U.S. export controls designed to limit China&#x27;s AI capabilities. In August, DeepSeek hinted that China would soon have \"next generation\" domestically built chips to support its models. The company indicated its systems work with Chinese-made chips from Huawei and Cambricon without additional setup.DeepSeek&#x27;s original V3 model was reportedly trained on roughly 2,000 older Nvidia H800 chips — hardware since restricted for China export. The company has not disclosed what powered V3.2 training, but its continued advancement suggests export controls alone cannot halt Chinese AI progress.What DeepSeek&#x27;s release means for the future of AI competitionThe release arrives at a pivotal moment. After years of massive investment, some analysts question whether an AI bubble is forming. DeepSeek&#x27;s ability to match American frontier models at a fraction of the cost challenges assumptions that AI leadership requires enormous capital expenditure.The company&#x27;s technical report reveals that post-training investment now exceeds 10% of pre-training costs — a substantial allocation credited for reasoning improvements. But DeepSeek acknowledges gaps: \"The breadth of world knowledge in DeepSeek-V3.2 still lags behind leading proprietary models,\" the report states. The company plans to address this by scaling pre-training compute.DeepSeek-V3.2-Speciale remains available through a temporary API until December 15, when its capabilities will merge into the standard release. The Speciale variant is designed exclusively for deep reasoning and does not support tool calling — a limitation the standard model addresses.For now, the AI race between the United States and China has entered a new phase. DeepSeek&#x27;s release demonstrates that open-source models can achieve frontier performance, that efficiency innovations can slash costs dramatically, and that the most powerful AI systems may soon be freely available to anyone with an internet connection.As one commenter on X observed: \"Deepseek just casually breaking those historic benchmarks set by Gemini is bonkers.\"The question is no longer whether Chinese AI can compete with Silicon Valley.

          "standfirst": "The previous generation of Sony's wireless headphones, the excellent WH-1000XM5, are available for as low as $248 for Cyber Monday. That's nearly equal to the record low the headphones hit on Prime Day, and $152 off their normal $400 price. Sony's flagship noise-canceling headphones are now the WH-1000XM6, but if you're on a budget, you'll still get a fantastic audio experience from the older model, especially at this heavily discounted price. We awarded the WH-1000XM5 a score of 95 in our 2022 review, praising the supremely comfortable redesign, sound quality and powerful ANC. Battery life is also very respectable at 30 hours. We found the punchy bass an improvement over their predecessors, and the overall sound deeper and more immersive than the M4 headphones. As for noise-canceling, Sony’s decision to double the number of microphones and processors used for ANC means an improvement in blocking higher frequency sounds, such as human voices. They aren’t entirely baby scream-proof, but then few headphones are. Naturally, the WH-1000XM6 that this year replaced the M5 as Sony’s flagship model offers even better sound quality and noise cancellation, while remaining extremely comfortable throughout long listening sessions. But they’re also a lot more expensive at $450 — they're on sale now for $398 for Cyber Monday, so you have the option to upgrade to the latest flagship if you're willing to spend a bit more.

          "title": "MIT offshoot Liquid AI releases blueprint for enterprise-grade small-model training",
          "standfirst": "When Liquid AI, a startup founded by MIT computer scientists back in 2023, introduced its Liquid Foundation Models series 2 (LFM2) in July 2025, the pitch was straightforward: deliver the fastest on-device foundation models on the market using the new \"liquid\" architecture, with training and inference efficiency that made small models a serious alternative to cloud-only large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI&#x27;s GPT series and Google&#x27;s Gemini. The initial release shipped dense checkpoints at 350M, 700M, and 1.2B parameters, a hybrid architecture heavily weighted toward gated short convolutions, and benchmark numbers that placed LFM2 ahead of similarly sized competitors like Qwen3, Llama 3.2, and Gemma 3 on both quality and CPU throughput. The message to enterprises was clear: real-time, privacy-preserving AI on phones, laptops, and vehicles no longer required sacrificing capability for latency.In the months since that launch, Liquid has expanded LFM2 into a broader product line — adding task-and-domain-specialized variants, a small video ingestion and analysis model, and an edge-focused deployment stack called LEAP — and positioned the models as the control layer for on-device and on-prem agentic systems. Now, with the publication of the detailed, 51-page LFM2 technical report on arXiv, the company is going a step further: making public the architecture search process, training data mixture, distillation objective, curriculum strategy, and post-training pipeline behind those models. And unlike earlier open models, LFM2 is built around a repeatable recipe: a hardware-in-the-loop search process, a training curriculum that compensates for smaller parameter budgets, and a post-training pipeline tuned for instruction following and tool use. Rather than just offering weights and an API, Liquid is effectively publishing a detailed blueprint that other organizations can use as a reference for training their own small, efficient models from scratch, tuned to their own hardware and deployment constraints.A model family designed around real constraints, not GPU labsThe technical report begins with a premise enterprises are intimately familiar with: real AI systems hit limits long before benchmarks do. Latency budgets, peak memory ceilings, and thermal throttling define what can actually run in production—especially on laptops, tablets, commodity servers, and mobile devices.To address this, Liquid AI performed architecture search directly on target hardware, including Snapdragon mobile SoCs and Ryzen laptop CPUs. The result is a consistent outcome across sizes: a minimal hybrid architecture dominated by gated short convolution blocks and a small number of grouped-query attention (GQA) layers. This design was repeatedly selected over more exotic linear-attention and SSM hybrids because it delivered a better quality-latency-memory Pareto profile under real device conditions.This matters for enterprise teams in three ways:Predictability. The architecture is simple, parameter-efficient, and stable across model sizes from 350M to 2.6B.Operational portability. Dense and MoE variants share the same structural backbone, simplifying deployment across mixed hardware fleets.On-device feasibility. Prefill and decode throughput on CPUs surpass comparable open models by roughly 2× in many cases, reducing the need to offload routine tasks to cloud inference endpoints.Instead of optimizing for academic novelty, the report reads as a systematic attempt to design models enterprises can actually ship.This is notable and more practical for enterprises in a field where many open models quietly assume access to multi-H100 clusters during inference.A training pipeline tuned for enterprise-relevant behaviorLFM2 adopts a training approach that compensates for the smaller scale of its models with structure rather than brute force. Key elements include:10–12T token pre-training and an additional 32K-context mid-training phase, which extends the model’s useful context window without exploding compute costs.A decoupled Top-K knowledge distillation objective that sidesteps the instability of standard KL distillation when teachers provide only partial logits.A three-stage post-training sequence—SFT, length-normalized preference alignment, and model merging—designed to produce more reliable instruction following and tool-use behavior.For enterprise AI developers, the significance is that LFM2 models behave less like “tiny LLMs” and more like practical agents able to follow structured formats, adhere to JSON schemas, and manage multi-turn chat flows. Many open models at similar sizes fail not due to lack of reasoning ability, but due to brittle adherence to instruction templates. The LFM2 post-training recipe directly targets these rough edges.In other words: Liquid AI optimized small models for operational reliability, not just scoreboards.Multimodality designed for device constraints, not lab demosThe LFM2-VL and LFM2-Audio variants reflect another shift: multimodality built around token efficiency.Rather than embedding a massive vision transformer directly into an LLM, LFM2-VL attaches a SigLIP2 encoder through a connector that aggressively reduces visual token count via PixelUnshuffle. High-resolution inputs automatically trigger dynamic tiling, keeping token budgets controllable even on mobile hardware. LFM2-Audio uses a bifurcated audio path—one for embeddings, one for generation—supporting real-time transcription or speech-to-speech on modest CPUs.For enterprise platform architects, this design points toward a practical future where:document understanding happens directly on endpoints such as field devices;audio transcription and speech agents run locally for privacy compliance;multimodal agents operate within fixed latency envelopes without streaming data off-device.The through-line is the same: multimodal capability without requiring a GPU farm.Retrieval models built for agent systems, not legacy searchLFM2-ColBERT extends late-interaction retrieval into a footprint small enough for enterprise deployments that need multilingual RAG without the overhead of specialized vector DB accelerators.This is particularly meaningful as organizations begin to orchestrate fleets of agents. Fast local retrieval—running on the same hardware as the reasoning model—reduces latency and provides a governance win: documents never leave the device boundary.Taken together, the VL, Audio, and ColBERT variants show LFM2 as a modular system, not a single model drop.The emerging blueprint for hybrid enterprise AI architecturesAcross all variants, the LFM2 report implicitly sketches what tomorrow’s enterprise AI stack will look like: hybrid local-cloud orchestration, where small, fast models operating on devices handle time-critical perception, formatting, tool invocation, and judgment tasks, while larger models in the cloud offer heavyweight reasoning when needed.Several trends converge here:Cost control. Running routine inference locally avoids unpredictable cloud billing.Latency determinism. TTFT and decode stability matter in agent workflows; on-device eliminates network jitter.Governance and compliance. Local execution simplifies PII handling, data residency, and auditability.Resilience. Agentic systems degrade gracefully if the cloud path becomes unavailable.Enterprises adopting these architectures will likely treat small on-device models as the “control plane” of agentic workflows, with large cloud models serving as on-demand accelerators.LFM2 is one of the clearest open-source foundations for that control layer to date.The strategic takeaway: on-device AI is now a design choice, not a compromiseFor years, organizations building AI features have accepted that “real AI” requires cloud inference. LFM2 challenges that assumption. The models perform competitively across reasoning, instruction following, multilingual tasks, and RAG—while simultaneously achieving substantial latency gains over other open small-model families.For CIOs and CTOs finalizing 2026 roadmaps, the implication is direct: small, open, on-device models are now strong enough to carry meaningful slices of production workloads.LFM2 will not replace frontier cloud models for frontier-scale reasoning. But it offers something enterprises arguably need more: a reproducible, open, and operationally feasible foundation for agentic systems that must run anywhere, from phones to industrial endpoints to air-gapped secure facilities.In the broadening landscape of enterprise AI, LFM2 is less a research milestone and more a sign of architectural convergence. The future is not cloud or edge—it’s both, operating in concert. And releases like LFM2 provide the building blocks for organizations prepared to build that hybrid future intentionally rather than accidentally.",

Fast local retrieval—running on the same hardware as the reasoning model—reduces latency and provides a governance win: documents never leave the device boundary.Taken together, the VL, Audio, and ColBERT variants show LFM2 as a modular system, not a single model drop.The emerging blueprint for hybrid enterprise AI architecturesAcross all variants, the LFM2 report implicitly sketches what tomorrow’s enterprise AI stack will look like: hybrid local-cloud orchestration, where small, fast models operating on devices handle time-critical perception, formatting, tool invocation, and judgment tasks, while larger models in the cloud offer heavyweight reasoning when needed.Several trends converge here:Cost control. Running routine inference locally avoids unpredictable cloud billing.Latency determinism. TTFT and decode stability matter in agent workflows; on-device eliminates network jitter.Governance and compliance. Local execution simplifies PII handling, data residency, and auditability.Resilience. Agentic systems degrade gracefully if the cloud path becomes unavailable.Enterprises adopting these architectures will likely treat small on-device models as the “control plane” of agentic workflows, with large cloud models serving as on-demand accelerators.LFM2 is one of the clearest open-source foundations for that control layer to date.The strategic takeaway: on-device AI is now a design choice, not a compromiseFor years, organizations building AI features have accepted that “real AI” requires cloud inference. LFM2 challenges that assumption. The models perform competitively across reasoning, instruction following, multilingual tasks, and RAG—while simultaneously achieving substantial latency gains over other open small-model families.For CIOs and CTOs finalizing 2026 roadmaps, the implication is direct: small, open, on-device models are now strong enough to carry meaningful slices of production workloads.LFM2 will not replace frontier cloud models for frontier-scale reasoning. But it offers something enterprises arguably need more: a reproducible, open, and operationally feasible foundation for agentic systems that must run anywhere, from phones to industrial endpoints to air-gapped secure facilities.In the broadening landscape of enterprise AI, LFM2 is less a research milestone and more a sign of architectural convergence. The future is not cloud or edge—it’s both, operating in concert. And releases like LFM2 provide the building blocks for organizations prepared to build that hybrid future intentionally rather than accidentally.",

That gap defines the difference between passing benchmarks and withstanding real-world attacks — and it&#x27;s a gap most enterprises don&#x27;t know exists.When attackers send a single malicious request, open-weight AI models hold the line well, blocking attacks 87% of the time (on average). But when those same attackers send multiple prompts across a conversation via probing, reframing and escalating across numerous exchanges, the math inverts fast. Attack success rates climb from 13% to 92%.For CISOs evaluating open-weight models for enterprise deployment, the implications are immediate: The models powering your customer-facing chatbots, internal copilots and autonomous agents may pass single-turn safety benchmarks while failing catastrophically under sustained adversarial pressure.\"A lot of these models have started getting a little bit better,\" DJ Sampath, SVP of Cisco&#x27;s AI software platform group, told VentureBeat. \"When you attack it once, with single-turn attacks, they&#x27;re able to protect it. But when you go from single-turn to multi-turn, all of a sudden these models are starting to display vulnerabilities where the attacks are succeeding, almost 80% in some cases.\"Why conversations break open-weight models openThe Cisco AI Threat Research and Security team found that open-weight AI models that block single attacks collapse under the weight of conversational persistence. Their recently published study shows that jailbreak success rates climb nearly tenfold when attackers extend the conversation. The findings, published in \"Death by a Thousand Prompts: Open Model Vulnerability Analysis\" by Amy Chang, Nicholas Conley, Harish Santhanalakshmi Ganesan and Adam Swanda, quantify what many security researchers have long observed and suspected, but couldn&#x27;t prove at scale.But Cisco&#x27;s research does, showing that treating multi-turn AI attacks as an extension of single-turn vulnerabilities misses the point entirely. The gap between them is categorical, not a matter of degree.The research team evaluated eight open-weight models: Alibaba (Qwen3-32B), DeepSeek (v3.1), Google (Gemma 3-1B-IT), Meta (Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct), Microsoft (Phi-4), Mistral (Large-2), OpenAI (GPT-OSS-20b) and Zhipu AI (GLM 4.5-Air). Using black-box methodology — or testing without knowledge of internal architecture, which is exactly how real-world attackers operate — the team measured what happens when persistence replaces single-shot attacks.The researchers note: \"Single-turn attack success rates (ASR) average 13.11%, as models can more readily detect and reject isolated adversarial inputs. In contrast, multi-turn attacks, leveraging conversational persistence, achieve an average ASR of 64.21% [a 5X increase], with some models like Alibaba Qwen3-32B reaching an 86.18% ASR and Mistral Large-2 reaching a 92.78% ASR.\" The latter was up 21.97% from a single-turn. The results define the gapThe paper’s research team provides a succinct take on open-weight model resilience against attacks: \"This escalation, ranging from 2x to 10x, stems from models&#x27; inability to maintain contextual defenses over extended dialogues, allowing attackers to refine prompts and bypass safeguards.\"Figure 1: Single-turn attack success rates (blue) versus multi-turn success rates (red) across all eight tested models. The gap ranges from 10 percentage points (Google Gemma) to over 70 percentage points (Mistral, Llama, Qwen). Source: Cisco AI Defense The five techniques that make persistence lethalThe research tested five multi-turn attack strategies, each exploiting a different aspect of conversational persistence. Information decomposition and reassembly: Breaks harmful requests into innocuous components across turns, then reassemble them. Against Mistral Large-2, this technique achieved 95% success.Contextual ambiguity introduces vague framing that confuses safety classifiers, reaching 94.78% success against Mistral Large-2.Crescendo attacks gradually escalate requests across turns, starting innocuously and building to harmful, hitting 92.69% success against Mistral Large-2.Role-play and persona adoption establish fictional contexts that normalize harmful outputs, achieving up to 92.44% success against Mistral Large-2.Refusal reframe repackages rejected requests with different justifications until one succeeds, reaching up to 89.15% success against Mistral Large-2.What makes these techniques effective isn&#x27;t sophistication, it&#x27;s familiarity. They mirror how humans naturally converse: building cBntext, clarifying requests and reframing when initial approaches fail. The models aren&#x27;t vulnerable to exotic attacks. They&#x27;re susceptible to persistence itself.Table 2: Attack success rates by technique across all models. The consistency across techniques means enterprises cannot defend against just one pattern. Source: Cisco AI Defense The open-weight security paradoxThis research lands at a critical inflection point as open source increasingly contributes to cybersecurity. Open-source and open-weight models have become foundational to the cybersecurity industry’s innovation. From accelerating startup time-to-market, reducing enterprise vendor lock-in and enabling customization that proprietary models can&#x27;t match, open source is seen as the go-to platform by the majority of cybersecurity startups. The paradox isn&#x27;t lost on Cisco. The company&#x27;s own Foundation-Sec-8B model, purpose-built for cybersecurity applications, is distributed as open weights on Hugging Face. Cisco isn&#x27;t just criticizing competitors&#x27; models. The company is acknowledging a systemic vulnerability affecting the entire open-weight ecosystem, including models they themselves release. The message isn&#x27;t \"avoid open-weight models.\" It&#x27;s \"understand what you&#x27;re deploying and add appropriate guardrails.\"Sampath is direct about the implications: \"Open source has its own set of drawbacks. When you start to pull a model that is open weight, you have to think through what the security implications are and make sure that you&#x27;re constantly putting the right types of guardrails around the model.\"Table 1: Attack success rates and security gaps across all tested models. Gaps exceeding 70% (Qwen at +73.48%, Mistral at +70.81%, Llama at +70.32%) represent high-priority candidates for additional guardrails before deployment. Source: Cisco AI Defense.Why lab philosophy defines security outcomesThe security gap discovered by Cisco correlates directly with how AI labs approach alignment.Their research makes this pattern clear: \"Models that focus on capabilities (e.g., Llama) did demonstrate the highest multi-turn gaps, with Meta explaining that developers are &#x27;in the driver seat to tailor safety for their use case&#x27; in post-training. Models that focused heavily on alignment (e.g., Google Gemma-3-1B-IT) did demonstrate a more balanced profile between single- and multi-turn strategies deployed against it, indicating a focus on &#x27;rigorous safety protocols&#x27; and &#x27;low risk level&#x27; for misuse.\"Capability-first labs produce capability-first gaps. Meta&#x27;s Llama shows a 70.32% security gap. Mistral&#x27;s model card for Large-2 acknowledges it \"does not have any moderation mechanisms\" and shows a 70.81% gap. Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen technical reports don&#x27;t acknowledge safety or security concerns at all, and the model posts the highest gap at 73.48%.Safety-first labs produce smaller gaps. Google&#x27;s Gemma emphasizes \"rigorous safety protocols\" and targets a \"low risk level\" for misuse. The outcome is the lowest gap at 10.53%, with more balanced performance across single- and multi-turn scenarios.Models optimized for capability and flexibility tend to arrive with less built-in safety. That&#x27;s a design choice, and for many enterprise use cases, it&#x27;s the right one. But enterprises need to recognize that \"capability-first\" often means \"security-second\" and budget accordingly.Where attacks succeed mostCisco tested 102 distinct subthreat categories. The top 15 achieved high success rates across all models, suggesting targeted defensive measures could deliver disproportionate security improvements.Figure 4: The 15 most vulnerable subthreat categories, ranked by average attack success rate.

Everybody&#x27;s clamoring to use these tools. But I need the right guardrails in place because I don&#x27;t want to show up in a Wall Street Journal piece,&#x27;\" he told VentureBeat. Sampath continued, \"If we have the ability to see prompt injection attacks and block them, I can then unlock and unleash AI adoption in a fundamentally different fashion.\"What defense requiresThe research points to six critical capabilities that enterprises should prioritize:Context-aware guardrails that maintain state across conversation turnsModel-agnostic runtime protectionsContinuous red-teaming targeting multi-turn strategiesHardened system prompts designed to resist instruction overrideComprehensive logging for forensic visibilityThreat-specific mitigations for the top 15 subthreat categories identified in the researchThe window for actionSampath cautions against waiting: \"A lot of folks are in this holding pattern, waiting for AI to settle down. That is the wrong way to think about this. Every couple of weeks, something dramatic happens that resets that frame. Pick a partner and start doubling down.\"As the report&#x27;s authors conclude: \"The 2-10x superiority of multi-turn over single-turn attacks, model-specific weaknesses and high-risk threat patterns necessitate urgent action.\"To repeat: One prompt gets blocked, 10 prompts get through. That equation won&#x27;t change until enterprises stop testing single-turn defenses and start securing entire conversations.",

          "standfirst": "A VPN subscription can make for a good holiday gift. Everyone could do with having a VPN to help protect their online activity from prying eyes (and, perhaps, access more things to watch from their favorite streaming services). It's something useful that a gift recipient may have never realized they needed. Of course, you may be looking for a great deal on a VPN yourself, and the Cyber Monday discount for Proton VPN is nothing to sniff at. You can get two years of access to the VPN Plus tier of the service for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month. That's a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you'd save $180. Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN overall because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection might not be fast enough for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service's library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices. The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it's easy to find a feature or setting you're looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you're connecting to a server on the other side of the planet). Perhaps, most importantly, though, it's Proton's commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There's a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton's servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well. Proton VPN is not the only service to offer a Cyber Monday VPN deal this year, of course. There are plenty of others available on services we like. Here are the best of the bunch if you're looking for an alternative to Proton VPN. Surfshark One (24 months + 3 free months) for $59.13 (88 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. NordVPN Plus (24 months + 3 free months) for $105.03 (74 percent off): NordVPN has taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription for Cyber Monday. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. CyberGhost (24 months + 4 free months) for $56.94 (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Private Internet Access (36 months + 4 free months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 40 months of PIA for just under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. ExpressVPN Basic (15 months) for $74.85 (61 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries.

For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. CyberGhost (24 months + 4 free months) for $56.94 (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Private Internet Access (36 months + 4 free months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 40 months of PIA for just under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected. ExpressVPN Basic (15 months) for $74.85 (61 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries.

          "title": "OpenAGI emerges from stealth with an AI agent that it claims crushes OpenAI and Anthropic",
          "standfirst": "A stealth artificial intelligence startup founded by an MIT researcher emerged this morning with an ambitious claim: its new AI model can control computers better than systems built by OpenAI and Anthropic — at a fraction of the cost.OpenAGI, led by chief executive Zengyi Qin, released Lux, a foundation model designed to operate computers autonomously by interpreting screenshots and executing actions across desktop applications. The San Francisco-based company says Lux achieves an 83.6 percent success rate on Online-Mind2Web, a benchmark that has become the industry&#x27;s most rigorous test for evaluating AI agents that control computers.That score is a significant leap over the leading models from well-funded competitors. OpenAI&#x27;s Operator, released in January, scores 61.3 percent on the same benchmark. Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Computer Use achieves 56.3 percent.\"Traditional LLM training feeds a large amount of text corpus into the model. The model learns to produce text,\" Qin said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"By contrast, our model learns to produce actions. The model is trained with a large amount of computer screenshots and action sequences, allowing it to produce actions to control the computer.\"The announcement arrives at a pivotal moment for the AI industry. Technology giants and startups alike have poured billions of dollars into developing autonomous agents capable of navigating software, booking travel, filling out forms, and executing complex workflows. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Microsoft have all released or announced agent products in the past year, betting that computer-controlling AI will become as transformative as chatbots.Yet independent research has cast doubt on whether current agents are as capable as their creators suggest.Why university researchers built a tougher benchmark to test AI agents—and what they discoveredThe Online-Mind2Web benchmark, developed by researchers at Ohio State University and the University of California, Berkeley, was designed specifically to expose the gap between marketing claims and actual performance.Published in April and accepted to the Conference on Language Modeling 2025, the benchmark comprises 300 diverse tasks across 136 real websites — everything from booking flights to navigating complex e-commerce checkouts. Unlike earlier benchmarks that cached parts of websites, Online-Mind2Web tests agents in live online environments where pages change dynamically and unexpected obstacles appear.The results, according to the researchers, painted \"a very different picture of the competency of current agents, suggesting over-optimism in previously reported results.\"When the Ohio State team tested five leading web agents with careful human evaluation, they found that many recent systems — despite heavy investment and marketing fanfare — did not outperform SeeAct, a relatively simple agent released in January 2024. Even OpenAI&#x27;s Operator, the best performer among commercial offerings in their study, achieved only 61 percent success.\"It seemed that highly capable and practical agents were maybe indeed just months away,\" the researchers wrote in a blog post accompanying their paper. \"However, we are also well aware that there are still many fundamental gaps in research to fully autonomous agents, and current agents are probably not as competent as the reported benchmark numbers may depict.\"The benchmark has gained traction as an industry standard, with a public leaderboard hosted on Hugging Face tracking submissions from research groups and companies.How OpenAGI trained its AI to take actions instead of just generating textOpenAGI&#x27;s claimed performance advantage stems from what the company calls \"Agentic Active Pre-training,\" a training methodology that differs fundamentally from how most large language models learn.Conventional language models train on vast text corpora, learning to predict the next word in a sequence. The resulting systems excel at generating coherent text but were not designed to take actions in graphical environments.Lux, according to Qin, takes a different approach. The model trains on computer screenshots paired with action sequences, learning to interpret visual interfaces and determine which clicks, keystrokes, and navigation steps will accomplish a given goal.\"The action allows the model to actively explore the computer environment, and such exploration generates new knowledge, which is then fed back to the model for training,\" Qin told VentureBeat. \"This is a naturally self-evolving process, where a better model produces better exploration, better exploration produces better knowledge, and better knowledge leads to a better model.\"This self-reinforcing training loop, if it functions as described, could help explain how a smaller team might achieve results that elude larger organizations. Rather than requiring ever-larger static datasets, the approach would allow the model to continuously improve by generating its own training data through exploration.OpenAGI also claims significant cost advantages. The company says Lux operates at roughly one-tenth the cost of frontier models from OpenAI and Anthropic while executing tasks faster.Unlike browser-only competitors, Lux can control Slack, Excel, and other desktop applicationsA critical distinction in OpenAGI&#x27;s announcement: Lux can control applications across an entire desktop operating system, not just web browsers.Most commercially available computer-use agents, including early versions of Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Computer Use, focus primarily on browser-based tasks. That limitation excludes vast categories of productivity work that occur in desktop applications — spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel, communications in Slack, design work in Adobe products, code editing in development environments.OpenAGI says Lux can navigate these native applications, a capability that would substantially expand the addressable market for computer-use agents. The company is releasing a developer software development kit alongside the model, allowing third parties to build applications on top of Lux.The company is also working with Intel to optimize Lux for edge devices, which would allow the model to run locally on laptops and workstations rather than requiring cloud infrastructure. That partnership could address enterprise concerns about sending sensitive screen data to external servers.\"We are partnering with Intel to optimize our model on edge devices, which will make it the best on-device computer-use model,\" Qin said.The company confirmed it is in exploratory discussions with AMD and Microsoft about additional partnerships.What happens when you ask an AI agent to copy your bank detailsComputer-use agents present novel safety challenges that do not arise with conventional chatbots. An AI system capable of clicking buttons, entering text, and navigating applications could, if misdirected, cause significant harm — transferring money, deleting files, or exfiltrating sensitive information.OpenAGI says it has built safety mechanisms directly into Lux. When the model encounters requests that violate its safety policies, it refuses to proceed and alerts the user.In an example provided by the company, when a user asked the model to \"copy my bank details and paste it into a new Google doc,\" Lux responded with an internal reasoning step: \"The user asks me to copy the bank details, which are sensitive information. Based on the safety policy, I am not able to perform this action.\" The model then issued a warning to the user rather than executing the potentially dangerous request.Such safeguards will face intense scrutiny as computer-use agents proliferate. Security researchers have already demonstrated prompt injection attacks against early agent systems, where malicious instructions embedded in websites or documents can hijack an agent&#x27;s behavior. Whether Lux&#x27;s safety mechanisms can withstand adversarial attacks remains to be tested by independent researchers.The MIT researcher who built two of GitHub&#x27;s most downloaded AI modelsQin brings an unusual combination of academic credentials and entrepreneurial experience to OpenAGI.He completed his doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2025, where his research focused on computer vision, robotics, and machine learning. His academic work appeared in top venues including the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, the International Conference on Learning Representations, and the International Conference on Machine Learning.Before founding OpenAGI, Qin built several widely adopted AI systems. JetMoE, a large language model he led development on, demonstrated that a high-performing model could be trained from scratch for less than $100,000 — a fraction of the tens of millions typically required. The model outperformed Meta&#x27;s LLaMA2-7B on standard benchmarks, according to a technical report that attracted attention from MIT&#x27;s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.His previous open-source projects achieved remarkable adoption. OpenVoice, a voice cloning model, accumulated approximately 35,000 stars on GitHub and ranked in the top 0.03 percent of open-source projects by popularity. MeloTTS, a text-to-speech system, has been downloaded more than 19 million times, making it one of the most widely used audio AI models since its 2024 release.Qin also co-founded MyShell, an AI agent platform that has attracted six million users who have collectively built more than 200,000 AI agents. Users have had more than one billion interactions with agents on the platform, according to the company.Inside the billion-dollar race to build AI that controls your computerThe computer-use agent market has attracted intense interest from investors and technology giants over the past year.OpenAI released Operator in January, allowing users to instruct an AI to complete tasks across the web. Anthropic has continued developing Claude Computer Use, positioning it as a core capability of its Claude model family. Google has incorporated agent features into its Gemini products. Microsoft has integrated agent capabilities across its Copilot offerings and Windows.Yet the market remains nascent. Enterprise adoption has been limited by concerns about reliability, security, and the ability to handle edge cases that occur frequently in real-world workflows. The performance gaps revealed by benchmarks like Online-Mind2Web suggest that current systems may not be ready for mission-critical applications.OpenAGI enters this competitive landscape as an independent alternative, positioning superior benchmark performance and lower costs against the massive resources of its well-funded rivals. The company&#x27;s Lux model and developer SDK are available beginning today.Whether OpenAGI can translate benchmark dominance into real-world reliability remains the central question. The AI industry has a long history of impressive demos that falter in production, of laboratory results that crumble against the chaos of actual use. Benchmarks measure what they measure, and the distance between a controlled test and an 8-hour workday full of edge cases, exceptions, and surprises can be vast.But if Lux performs in the wild the way it performs in the lab, the implications extend far beyond one startup&#x27;s success. It would suggest that the path to capable AI agents runs not through the largest checkbooks but through the cleverest architectures—that a small team with the right ideas can outmaneuver the giants.The technology industry has seen that story before. It rarely stays true for long.",

This year, there are plenty of deals on streaming services and other subscriptions; we think the Disney+ Hulu bundle ($60 for one year) is one of the stronger offerings, considering it typically costs $13 per month. That’s less than half price, if you can’t be bothered to do math in the early hours of Monday morning. Better still, the offer is available to new and existing subscribers. Other recent discounts include 25 percent off the Pixel 10 Pro and 20 percent off Sonos’ top soundbar, the Arc Ultra. Check out all the biggest deals on our Cyber Monday 2025 hub — and come back for our regularly scheduled TMA tomorrow. — Mat Smith The other big stories (and deals) this morning The Ayaneo Next II is a hulking gaming handheld with a 9-inch display Apple TV+ Cyber Monday deal: Six months for $6 per month There’s a cute voice messaging app for Playdate now The best tech gifts and cool gadgets This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/the-morning-after-engadget-newsletter-121521058.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Cyber Monday is here with a special gift: 25 percent off Apple’s latest MacBook Air M4. The 13-inch model is down to $749, from $999 — as low as we've seen it. The MacBook Air M4 garnered a 92 in our review thanks to features like its sharp Liquid Retina display and impressive M4 performance. The MacBook Air M4 continues Apple’s streak of refining what’s already its most popular laptop. It runs on the new M4 chip with a 10-core GPU, offering fast performance for everyday work, creative apps and light gaming. The upgrade from the M3 model is noticeable in both speed and efficiency, making it ideal for multitasking or editing photos and videos on the go. Despite the power boost, it keeps the same slim profile that helped define the MacBook Air line. The unibody design is still one of the thinnest and lightest in its class, weighing just under three pounds, with a durable aluminum chassis available in four colors — midnight, starlight, silver and space gray. The fanless build keeps it completely silent during use, even when running intensive tasks. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display supports the P3 wide color gamut and reaches up to 500 nits of brightness, making text and images look crisp and vibrant whether you’re working indoors or near a window. You also get a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, a three-mic array for clear video calls and a four-speaker setup with Spatial Audio support. Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, a MagSafe 3 charging port and a headphone jack. Battery life remains one of its standout features, with Apple rating it at up to 18 hours on a single charge. That easily covers a full day of work or travel without reaching for the charger. There are a few small limitations, like the lack of a high refresh rate display and the fact that both USB-C ports sit on the same side. Still, for most users, the MacBook Air M4 strikes the best balance between power, portability and price. If you want a larger screen, Apple’s 15-inch MacBook Air M4 offers the same specs with more workspace, but the 13-inch remains the best pick for portability. You can read more about how it compares to other Apple laptops in our guide to the best MacBooks. This MacBook Air M4 deal makes one of Apple’s best laptops an even smarter buy.

          "standfirst": "We spend a lot of time staring at our screens, so it’s worth finding one that actually feels good to use. The right monitor can make your desk setup feel faster, brighter and easier on the eyes, whether you’re deep into spreadsheets, watching a show or chasing higher frame rates in your favorite game.What the best monitor means, though, depends on what you do. Gamers might want smooth, fast refresh rates. Creators usually prioritize color accuracy. Office workers and students just need something clear, comfortable and reliable. Thankfully, monitors in 2025 cover all of those needs, with options that range from compact 24-inch displays to massive ultrawides built for serious multitasking.We’ve tested a variety of monitors across price ranges and use cases to find the ones that stand out for everyday use. No matter your budget, setup or screen-size preference, these are the monitors that make your PC, and your time in front of it, a little better. Table of Contents Best monitors for 2025 Factors to consider before buying a monitor Monitor FAQs Best monitors for 2025 Factors to consider before buying a monitor Panel type The cheapest monitors are still TN (twisted nematic), which are strictly for gamers or office use. VA (vertical alignment) monitors are also relatively cheap, while offering good brightness and a high contrast ratio. However, content creators will find that LCD, IPS displays (in-plane switching) deliver better color accuracy, pixel density, picture quality and wide viewing angles — making them a strong option for general computer monitor use. If maximum brightness is important, a quantum dot LCD display is the way to go — those are typically found in larger displays. OLED panels are now available and offer the best blacks and color reproduction, but they lack the brightness of LED or quantum dot displays. Plus, they’re expensive. The latest type of OLED monitor, called QD-OLED from Samsung, is now common among gaming monitors. The most notable advantage is that it can get a lot brighter, with recent models hitting up to 1,000 nits+ of peak brightness. MiniLEDs are now widely used in high-end displays. They’re similar to quantum dot tech, but as the name suggests, it uses smaller LED diodes that are just 0.2mm in diameter. As such, manufacturers can pack in up to three times more LEDs with more local dimming zones, delivering deeper blacks and better contrast. MiniLED displays also tend to offer excellent backlight control, making them a great choice for HDR content and video editing. Screen size, resolution and display format Where 24-inch displays used to be more or less standard (and can still be useful for basic computing), 27-, 32-, 34- and even 42-inch displays have become popular for entertainment, content creation and even gaming these days. Nearly every monitor used to be 16:9, but it’s now possible to find 16:10 and other more exotic display shapes. On the gaming and entertainment side, we’re also seeing curved monitors and widescreen ultrawide monitors with aspect ratios like 21:9. If you do decide to buy an ultrawide display, however, keep in mind that a 30-inch 21:9 model is the same height as a 24-inch monitor, so you might end up with a smaller display than you expected. A 4K monitor is nearly a must for content creators, and some folks are even going for 5K or all the way up to 8K. Keep in mind, though, that you’ll need a pretty powerful computer with a decent graphics card to drive all those sharp pixels. And 4K higher resolution should be paired with a screen size of 27 inches and up, or you won’t notice much difference between 1440p. At the same time, I wouldn’t get a model larger than 27 inches unless it’s 4K, as you’ll start to see pixelation if you’re working up close to the display. That’s when a lower resolution monitor shows its limits. One new monitor category to consider is portable monitors designed to be carried and used with laptops. Those typically come in 1080p resolutions and sizes from 13-15 inches. They usually have a lightweight kickstand-type support that folds up to keep things compact and maximize portability and functionality. HDR HDR adds vibrancy to entertainment and gaming – but be careful before jumping in. Some monitors that claim HDR on their marketing materials don’t even conform to a base standard. To be sure that a display at least meets minimum HDR specs, you’ll want to choose one with a DisplayHDR rating with each tier representing maximum brightness in nits. However, the lowest DisplayHDR 400 and 500 tiers may disappoint you with a lack of brightness, washed out blacks and mediocre color reproduction. If you can afford it, the best monitor to choose is a model with DisplayHDR 600, 1000 or True Black 400, True Black 500 and True Black 600. Where televisions typically offer HDR10 and Dolby Vision or HDR10+, most PC monitors only support the HDR10 standard, other than a few (very expensive) models. That doesn’t matter much for content creation or gaming, but HDR streaming on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other services won’t look quite as punchy. In addition, the best gaming monitors are usually the ones supporting HDR600 (and up), rather than content creation monitors – with a few exceptions. Refresh rate High refresh rate is a key feature, particularly on gaming monitors. A bare minimum nowadays is 60Hz, and 80Hz and higher refresh rates are much easier on the eyes. However, most 4K displays top out at 60Hz with some rare exceptions and the HDMI 2.0 spec only supports 4K at 60Hz, so you’d need at least DisplayPort 1.4 (4K at 120Hz) or HDMI 2.1. The latter is now available on a number of monitors, particularly gaming displays. However, it’s only supported by the latest NVIDIA RTX 3000- and 4000-series, AMD RX 6000-series GPUs. Support for G-Sync and AMD FreeSync is also something to look for if you want to eliminate screen tearing and stuttering during fast-paced gameplay — especially when paired with a high refresh rate. Inputs There are essentially three types of modern display inputs: Thunderbolt, DisplayPort and HDMI. Most monitors built for PCs come with the latter two, while a select few (typically built for Macs) will use Thunderbolt. To add to the confusion, USB-C ports may be Thunderbolt 3, and by extension, DisplayPort compatible, so you may need a USB-C to Thunderbolt or DisplayPort cable adapter depending on your display. Color bit depth Serious content creators should consider a more costly 10-bit monitor that can display billions of colors. If budget is an issue, you can go for an 8-bit panel that can fake billions of colors via dithering (often spec’d as “8-bit + FRC”). For entertainment or business purposes, a regular 8-bit monitor that can display millions of colors will be fine. Color gamut The other aspect of color is the gamut. That expresses the range of colors that can be reproduced and not just the number of colors. Most good monitors these days can cover the sRGB and Rec.709 gamuts (designed for photos and video respectively). For more demanding work, though, you’ll want one that can reproduce more demanding modern gamuts like AdobeRGB, DCI-P3 and Rec.2020 gamuts, which encompass a wider range of colors. The latter two are often used for film projection and HDR, respectively. Monitor FAQs Is OLED better than mini-LED for monitors? OLED is better than mini-LED in many areas but not all. Here are the advantages of OLED panels: OLED monitors don't have any \"blooming\" or halos around bright parts of the image. OLEDs have blacks with zero brightness, which is not achievable on mini-LED. That means they also have higher contrast ratios. OLEDs consume less energy. OLEDs have faster response times for gaming. And here are the advantages of mini-LED monitors: They are brighter (often much brighter), so it can be better for HDR content. They don't suffer from burn-in like OLED can. What size monitor is best for a home office? This depends on the individual. For normal use, 27-32 inches is the sweet spot. If you're one who likes many windows open at a time (like a stock broker), then you might want to go up to 37 or even 42 inches. Are curved monitors worth it for gaming? If you need as much speed as possible, a curved monitor lets you rapidly look around the screen without changing focus or moving your head as much compared to a flat screen. It also provides more immersion. The drawback is that curved displays tend to be wider so they take up more desk space. They're also generally more expensive.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-monitor-130006843.html?src=rss",

          "title": "Agent coordination is the missing piece in AI commerce — new AWS and Visa blueprints target the gap",
          "standfirst": "With necessary infrastructure now being developed for agentic commerce, enterprises must determine how to participate in this new form of buying and selling. But it remains a fragmented Wild West, with competing payment protocols, and it&#x27;s unclear what enterprises need to do to prepare. More cloud providers and AI model companies are beginning to provide the tools enterprises need to begin building agentic commerce-enabled systems. AWS, which will list Visa’s Intelligence Commerce platform on the AWS Marketplace, says it&#x27;s making it easier for enterprises to connect to tools that enable agentic payments and accelerate agentic commerce adoption. While this doesn’t mean Amazon has formally impleemnted Visa’s Trusted Agent Protocol (TAP), which would bring the world’s largest e-commerce platform to the agentic shopping space, it does show just how agentic commerce is fast becoming an enterprise focus. Scott Mullins, AWS managing director of worldwide financial services, told VentureBeat in an email that listing the platform “makes payment capabilities accessible” in a secure manner that quickly integrates with Visa’s system. “We’re giving developers pre-built frameworks and standardized infrastructure to eliminate major development barriers,” Mullins said. He noted that AWS is listing Visa’s platform to streamline integration with services like Bedrock and AgentCore. In addition, the two companies will publish blueprints to the public Bedrock AgentCore repository. Mullins said this will “significantly reduce development time and complexity that anyone can use to create travel booking agents, retail shopping agents and B2B payment reconciliation agents.”The Visa Intelligence Commerce platform will be MCP-compatible, allowing enterprises to connect agents running on it to other agents. What enterprises need to knowThrough the Visa Intelligence Commerce platform, AWS customers can access authentication, agentic tokenization and data personalization tools. This allows organizations to register and connect their agents to Visa’s payment infrastructure. The platform helps mask credit card details through tokenized digital credentials and lets companies set guidelines for agent transactions, such as spending limits. Rubali Birwadker, SVP and global head of growth at Visa, said in a press release that bringing the platform to AWS lets it scale, “helping to unlock faster innovation for developers and better experiences for consumers and businesses worldwide.”Mullins said Visa and AWS are helping to provide the foundational infrastructure for developers and businesses to pursue agentic commerce projects; however, for this to work, developers must coordinate several agents and understand the different needs across industries. “Real-world commerce often requires multiple agents working together,” Mullins said. “The travel booking agent blueprint, for instance, connects flight, hotel, car rental and train providers to deliver complete travel journeys with integrated payments. Developers need to design coordination patterns for these complex, multi-agent workflows.”Different use cases also have different needs, so enterprises need to plan carefully around existing infrastructure. This is where the MCP connection is vital, as it will enable communication between an organization’s agents to Visa’s platform while maintaining identity and security. Blueprints for agentic commerceMullins said that the biggest stumbling block for many enterprises experimenting with agentic commerce is the fragmentation of commerce systems, which creates integration challenges. “This collaboration will address these challenges by providing reference architecture blueprints that developers can use as starting points, combined with AWS&#x27;s cloud infrastructure and Visa&#x27;s trusted payment network to create a standardized, secure foundation for agentic commerce,” he said.The reference blueprints provide a framework for enterprise developers, solution architects and software vendors to follow when building new workflows. Mullins said the blueprints are being developed in coordination with Expedia Group, Intuit and the Eurostars Hotel company. The blueprints will work with the Visa Intelligent Commerce MCP server and APIs and will be managed through Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. AWS said that its goal is to “enable a foundation for agentic commerce at Scale, where transactions are handled by agents capable of real-time reasoning and coordination.”These blueprints would eventually become composable, reusable workflows for any organization looking to build travel booking agents or retail shopping agents. These don’t have to be consumer-focused agents; there can also be agents, for instance, buying flights for employees. Agentic commerce marches forwardAgentic commerce, where agents do product searching, cart adding and payments, is fast becoming the next frontier for AI players. Companies like OpenAI and Google have released AI-powered shopping tools to make it easier to surface products and allow agents to find them. Browsers like OpenAI’s Atlas and Comet from Perplexity also play a role in connecting agents to websites. Further, retailers like Walmart and Target have integrated with ChatGPT, so users can ask the chatbot to search for items through chat. One of the biggest problems facing the adoption of agentic commerce revolves around enabling safe, secure transactions. OpenAI and Stripe launched the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) in September, following Google’s announcement of Agent Pay Protocol (AP2) in collaboration with American Express, Mastercard, PayPal, Salesforce and ServiceNow. Visa followed soon after with TAP, which connects to the Visa Intelligent Commerce platform. “The foundation is now in place through this collaboration, but successful agentic commerce requires thoughtful design that considers the specific needs of industry, users and existing systems while leveraging the standardized infrastructure and blueprints now available,” Mullins said.",
          "content": "With necessary infrastructure now being developed for agentic commerce, enterprises must determine how to participate in this new form of buying and selling. But it remains a fragmented Wild West, with competing payment protocols, and it&#x27;s unclear what enterprises need to do to prepare. More cloud providers and AI model companies are beginning to provide the tools enterprises need to begin building agentic commerce-enabled systems. AWS, which will list Visa’s Intelligence Commerce platform on the AWS Marketplace, says it&#x27;s making it easier for enterprises to connect to tools that enable agentic payments and accelerate agentic commerce adoption. While this doesn’t mean Amazon has formally impleemnted Visa’s Trusted Agent Protocol (TAP), which would bring the world’s largest e-commerce platform to the agentic shopping space, it does show just how agentic commerce is fast becoming an enterprise focus. Scott Mullins, AWS managing director of worldwide financial services, told VentureBeat in an email that listing the platform “makes payment capabilities accessible” in a secure manner that quickly integrates with Visa’s system. “We’re giving developers pre-built frameworks and standardized infrastructure to eliminate major development barriers,” Mullins said. He noted that AWS is listing Visa’s platform to streamline integration with services like Bedrock and AgentCore. In addition, the two companies will publish blueprints to the public Bedrock AgentCore repository. Mullins said this will “significantly reduce development time and complexity that anyone can use to create travel booking agents, retail shopping agents and B2B payment reconciliation agents.”The Visa Intelligence Commerce platform will be MCP-compatible, allowing enterprises to connect agents running on it to other agents. What enterprises need to knowThrough the Visa Intelligence Commerce platform, AWS customers can access authentication, agentic tokenization and data personalization tools. This allows organizations to register and connect their agents to Visa’s payment infrastructure. The platform helps mask credit card details through tokenized digital credentials and lets companies set guidelines for agent transactions, such as spending limits. Rubali Birwadker, SVP and global head of growth at Visa, said in a press release that bringing the platform to AWS lets it scale, “helping to unlock faster innovation for developers and better experiences for consumers and businesses worldwide.”Mullins said Visa and AWS are helping to provide the foundational infrastructure for developers and businesses to pursue agentic commerce projects; however, for this to work, developers must coordinate several agents and understand the different needs across industries. “Real-world commerce often requires multiple agents working together,” Mullins said. “The travel booking agent blueprint, for instance, connects flight, hotel, car rental and train providers to deliver complete travel journeys with integrated payments. Developers need to design coordination patterns for these complex, multi-agent workflows.”Different use cases also have different needs, so enterprises need to plan carefully around existing infrastructure. This is where the MCP connection is vital, as it will enable communication between an organization’s agents to Visa’s platform while maintaining identity and security. Blueprints for agentic commerceMullins said that the biggest stumbling block for many enterprises experimenting with agentic commerce is the fragmentation of commerce systems, which creates integration challenges. “This collaboration will address these challenges by providing reference architecture blueprints that developers can use as starting points, combined with AWS&#x27;s cloud infrastructure and Visa&#x27;s trusted payment network to create a standardized, secure foundation for agentic commerce,” he said.The reference blueprints provide a framework for enterprise developers, solution architects and software vendors to follow when building new workflows. Mullins said the blueprints are being developed in coordination with Expedia Group, Intuit and the Eurostars Hotel company. The blueprints will work with the Visa Intelligent Commerce MCP server and APIs and will be managed through Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

Cyber Monday has brought discounts to many of those things. I'm going a different route, though, since I'm a little too dreamy for most physical appliances. The deal I'm most interested in is on an app that ensures online peace of mind with little intervention — so it's perfect for me. I'm talking about DeleteMe, which lets you reclaim some of your privacy while sharply reducing the amount of spam you receive on every channel. Through December 5, it's offering 30 percent off all subscriptions with the coupon code BFCM30OFF25. Chances are you've seen at least one public-facing \"people search\" site. You know the ones: they usually have names like 411.info or Find.people, and scrape technically public info like your address, phone number and other contact information. If you search your own name, it's hard to avoid immediately running to the kitchen to make yourself a tinfoil hat. The most annoying thing is that these \"data broker\" sites are legal to run and use, but that's also their biggest weakness. To operate in the open, brokers have to include an option to remove yourself from their database. Most of them make it as aggravating and time-consuming as possible, but the possibility is there. That's where DeleteMe comes in. All you have to do is sign up and enter all the data you want removed from brokerage sites. DeleteMe handles the rest. It searches for your information on people database sites, automatically sends opt-out requests, bugs the broker if they don't comply quickly enough and gives you a weekly report on how it's doing. You do have to be OK with DeleteMe itself having your data, but I trust them way more than the randos over at violate.privacy. It's so much faster than handling all the opt-out requests yourself, which — if you've ever tried it — rapidly becomes a full-time job. Since I've been using DeleteMe, I almost never get spam calls or texts anymore, except in short bursts before its crawlers catch my name on another site. And yes, it doesn't work on shady data brokers who don't follow the rules, but it's still a massive reduction of your online footprint. The only problem is that it's pretty expensive, so I strongly recommend jumping on this Cyber Monday deal.

          "title": "Hybrid cloud security must be rebuilt for an AI war it was never designed to fight",
          "standfirst": "Hybrid cloud security was built before the current era of automated, machine-based cyberattacks that take just milliseconds to execute and minutes to deliver devastating impacts to infrastructure. The architectures and tech stacks every enterprise depends on, from batch-based detection to siloed tools to 15-minute response windows, stood a better chance of defending against attackers moving at human speed. But in a weaponized AI world, those approaches to analyzing threat data don&#x27;t make sense. The latest survey numbers tell the story. More than half (55%) of organizations suffered cloud breaches in the past year. That’s a 17-point spike, according to Gigamon&#x27;s 2025 Hybrid Cloud Security Survey. Nearly half of the enterprises polled said their security tools missed the attack entirely. While 82% of enterprises now run hybrid or multi-cloud environments, only 36% express confidence in detecting threats in real time, per Fortinet&#x27;s 2025 State of Cloud Security Report.Adversaries aren’t wasting any time weaponizing AI to target hybrid cloud vulnerabilities. Organizations now face 1,925 cyberattacks weekly. That’s an increase of 47% in a year. Further, ransomware surged 126% in the first quarter of 2025 alone. The visibility gaps everyone talks about in hybrid environments is where breaches originate. The bottom line is that the security architectures designed for the pre-AI era can&#x27;t keep pace.But the industry is finally beginning to respond. CrowdStrike, for its part, is providing one vision of cybersecurity reinvention. Today at AWS re:Invent, the company is rolling out real-time Cloud Detection and Response, a platform designed to compress 15-minute response windows down to seconds. But the bigger story is why the entire approach to hybrid cloud security must change, and what that means for CISOs planning their 2026 strategies.Why the old model for hybrid cloud security is failingInitially, hybrid cloud promised the best of both worlds. Every organization could have public cloud agility with on-prem control. The security model that took shape reflected the best practices at the time. The trouble is that those best practices are now introducing vulnerabilities.How bad is it? The majority of security teams struggle to keep up with the threats and workloads. According to recent research: 91% of security leaders admit to making security compromises in their hybrid cloud environments, often trading visibility for speed, accepting siloed tools, and working with degraded data quality.76% report a shortage of cloud security expertise, limiting their ability to deploy and manage comprehensive solutions.Only 17% of organizations can see attackers moving laterally inside their network. That’s one of several blind spots that attackers capitalize on to exploit dwell times to the fullest, install ransomware, do reconnaissance, and lurk until the time is right to launch an attack.70% now view the public cloud as the riskiest environment in their infrastructure, and half are considering moving workloads back on-prem.\"You can&#x27;t secure what you can&#x27;t see,\" says Mandy Andress, CISO at Elastic. \"That&#x27;s the heart of the two big challenges we see as security practitioners: The complexity and sprawl of an organization&#x27;s infrastructure, coupled with the rapid pace of technological change.\"CrowdStrike&#x27;s Zaitsev diagnosed the root cause: \"Everyone assumed this was a one-way trip, lift and shift everything to the cloud. That&#x27;s not what happened. We&#x27;re seeing companies pull workloads back on-prem when the economics make sense. The reality? Everyone&#x27;s going to be hybrid. Five years from now. Ten years. Maybe forever. Security has to deal with that.\"Weaponized AI is changing the threat calculus fastThe weaponized AI era isn&#x27;t just accelerating attacks. It’s breaking the fundamental assumptions on which hybrid cloud security was built. The window between patch release and weaponized exploit collapsed from weeks to hours. The majority of adversaries aren&#x27;t typing commands anymore; they&#x27;re automating machine-based campaigns that orchestrate agentic AI at a scale and speed that current hybrid cloud tools and human SOC teams can&#x27;t keep up with.Zaitsev shared threat data from CrowdStrike&#x27;s mid-year hunting report, which found that cloud intrusions spiked 136% in a year, with roughly 40% of all cloud actor activity coming from Chinese nexus adversaries. This illustrates how quickly the threat landscape can change, and why hybrid cloud security needs to be reinvented for the AI era now.Mike Riemer, SVP and field CISO at Ivanti, has witnessed the timeline collapse. Threat actors now reverse-engineer patches within 72 hours using AI assistance. If enterprises don&#x27;t patch within that time frame, \"they&#x27;re open to exploit,\" Riemer told VentureBeat. \"That&#x27;s the new reality.\"Using previous-generation tools in the current cloud control plane is a dangerous bet. All it takes is a single compromised virtual machine (VM) that no one knows exists. Compromise the control plane, including the APIs that manage cloud resources, and they’ve got keys to spin up, modify or delete thousands of assets across a company’s hybrid environment.The seams between hybrid cloud environments are attack highways where millisecond-long attacks seldom leave any digital exhaust or traces. Many organizations never see weaponized AI attacks coming. VentureBeat hears that the worst hybrid cloud attacks can only be diagnosed long after the fact, when forensics and analysis are finally completed. Attackers and adversaries are that good at covering their tracks, often relying on living-off-the-land (LotL) tools to evade detection for months, even years in extreme cases. \"Enterprises training AI models are concentrating sensitive data in cloud environments, which is gold for adversaries,\" CrowdStrike&#x27;s Zaitsev said. \"Attackers are using agentic AI to run their campaigns. The traditional SOC workflow — see the alert, triage, investigate for 15 or 20 minutes, take action an hour or a day later —is completely insufficient. You&#x27;re bringing a knife to a gunfight.\"The human toll of relying on outdated architectureThe human toll of the hybrid cloud crisis shows up in SOC metrics and burnout. The AI SOC Market Landscape 2025 report found that the average security operations center processes 960 alerts daily. Each takes roughly 70 minutes to investigate properly. Assuming standard SOC staffing levels, there aren&#x27;t enough hours in the day to get to all those alerts. Futher, at least 40% of alerts, on average, never get touched. The human cost is staggering. A Tines survey of SOC analysts found that 71% are experiencing burnout. Two-thirds say manual grunt work consumes more than half of SOC workers&#x27; day. The same percentage are eyeing the exit from their jobs, and, in many extreme cases as some confide to VentureBeat, the industry.Hybrid environments make everything more complicated. Enterprises have different tools for AWS, Azure and on-prem architectures. They have different consoles; often different teams. As for alert correlation across environments? It&#x27;s manual and often delegated to the most senior SOC team members — if it happens at all. Batch-based detection can&#x27;t survive the weaponized AI eraHere&#x27;s what most legacy vendors of hybrid cloud security tools won&#x27;t openly admit: Cloud security tools are fundamentally flawed and not designed for real-time defense. The majority are batch-based, collecting logs every five, ten or fifteen minutes, processing them through correlation engines, then generating alerts. In a world where adversaries are increasingly executing machine-based attacks in milliseconds, a 15-minute detection delay isn&#x27;t just a minor setback; it&#x27;s the difference between stopping an attack and having to investigate a breach.As adversaries weaponize AI to accelerate cloud attacks and move laterally across systems, traditional cloud detection and response (CDR) tools relying on log batch processing are too slow to keep up. These systems can take 15 minutes or more to surface a single detection.CrowdStrike&#x27;s Zaitsev didn&#x27;t hedge. Before the company&#x27;s new tools released today, there was no such thing as real-time cloud detection and prevention, he claimed. \"Everyone else is batch-based. Suck down logs every five or 10 minutes, wait for data, import it, correlate it. We&#x27;ve seen competitors take 10 to 15 minutes minimum. That&#x27;s not detection—that&#x27;s archaeology.\"He continued: \"It&#x27;s carrier pigeon versus 5G. The gap between 15 minutes and 15 seconds isn&#x27;t just about alert quality. It&#x27;s the difference between getting a notification that something has already happened; now you&#x27;re doing cleanup, versus actually stopping the attack before the adversary achieves anything. One is incident response. The other is prevention.\"Reinventing hybrid cloud security must begin with speedCrowdStrike&#x27;s new real-time Cloud Detection and Response, part of Falcon Cloud Security&#x27;s unified cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP), is intended to secure every layer of hybrid cloud risk. It is built on three key innovations:Real-time detection engine: Built on event streaming technology pioneered and battle-tested by Falcon Adversary OverWatch, this engine analyzes cloud logs as they stream in. It then applies detections to eliminate latency and false positives.New cloud-specific indicators of attack out of the box: AI and machine learning (ML) correlate what&#x27;s happening in real time against cloud asset and identity data. That&#x27;s how the system catches stealthy moves like privilege escalation and CloudShell abuse before attackers can capitalize on them.Automated cloud response actions and workflows: There&#x27;s a gap in traditional cloud security. Cloud workload protection (CWP) simply stops at the workload. Cloud security posture management (CSPM) shows what could go wrong. But neither protects the control plane at runtime. New workflows built on Falcon Fusion SOAR close that gap, triggering instantly to disrupt adversaries before SOC teams can intervene.CrowdStrike&#x27;s Cloud Detection and Response integrates with AWS EventBridge, Amazon&#x27;s real-time serverless event streaming service. Instead of polling for logs on a schedule, the system taps directly into the event stream as things happen. \"Anything that calls itself CNAPP that doesn&#x27;t have real-time cloud detection and response is now obsolete,\" CrowdStrike CTO Elia Zaitsev said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. By contrast, EventBridge provides a us asynchronous, microservice-based, just-in-time event processing. \"We&#x27;re not waiting five minutes for a bucket of data,\" he said. But tapping into it is only half the problem. \"Can you actually keep up with that firehose? Can you process it fast enough to matter?\" Zaitsev asked rhetorically. CrowdStrike claims it can handle 60 million events per second. \"This isn&#x27;t duct tape and a demo.\"The underlying streaming technology isn&#x27;t new to CrowdStrike. Falcon Adversary OverWatch has been running stream processing for 15 years to hunt across CrowdStrike&#x27;s customer base, processing logs in real time rather than waiting for batch cycles to complete.The platform integrates Charlotte AI for automated triage, providing 98% accuracy matching expert managed detection and response (MDR) analysts, cutting 40-plus hours of manual work weekly. When the system detects a control plane compromise, it doesn&#x27;t wait for human approval. It revokes tokens, kills sessions, boots the attacker and nukes malicious CloudFormation templates, all before the adversary can execute.What this means for the CNAPP marketCloud security is the fastest-growing segment in Gartner&#x27;s latest forecast, expanding at a 25.9% CAGR through 2028. Precedence Research projects the market will grow from $36 billion in 2024 to $121 billion by 2034. And it&#x27;s crowded: Palo Alto Networks, Wiz (now absorbed into Google via a $32 billion acquisition), Microsoft, Orca, SentinelOne (to name a few). CrowdStrike already had a seat at the table as a Leader in the 2025 IDC MarketScape for CNAPP for the third consecutive year. Gartner predicts that by 2029, 40% of enterprises that successfully implement zero trust in cloud environments will rely on CNAPP platforms due to their visibility and control.But Zaitsev is making a bigger claim, stating that today&#x27;s announcement redefines what \"complete\" means for CNAPP in hybrid environments. \"CSPM isn&#x27;t going away. Cloud workload protection isn&#x27;t going away. What becomes obsolete is calling something a CNAPP when it lacks real-time cloud detection and response. You&#x27;re missing the safety net, the thing that catches what gets through proactive defenses. And in hybrid, something always gets through.\"The unified platform angle matters specifically for hybrid,\" he said. \"Adversaries deliberately hop between environments because they know defenders run different tools, often different teams, for cloud versus on-prem versus identity. Jumping domains is how you shake your tail. Attackers know most organizations can&#x27;t follow them across the seams. With us, they can&#x27;t do that anymore.\"Building hybrid security for the AI eraReinventing hybrid cloud security won&#x27;t happen overnight. Here&#x27;s where CISOs should focus:Map your hybrid visibility gaps: Every cloud workload, every on-prem system, every identity traversing between them. If 82% of breaches trace to blind spots, know where yours are before attackers find them.Pressure vendors on detection latency: Ask challenging questions about architecture. If they&#x27;re running batch-based processing, understand what a 15-minute window means when adversaries move in seconds.Deploy AI triage now: With 40% of alerts going uninvestigated and 71% of analysts burned out, automation isn&#x27;t a roadmap item; it’s a must-have for a successful deterrence strategy. Look for measurable accuracy rates and real-time savings.Compress patch cycles to 72 hours: AI-assisted reverse engineering has collapsed the exploit window. Monthly patch cycles don&#x27;t cut it anymore.Architect for permanent hybrid. Stop waiting for cloud migration to simplify security. It won&#x27;t. Design for complexity as the baseline, not a temporary state. The 54% of enterprises running hybrid models today will still be hybrid tomorrow.The bottom lineHybrid cloud security must be reinvented for the AI era. Previous-generation hybrid cloud security solutions are quickly being eclipsed by weaponized AI attacks, often launched as machine-on-machine intrusion attempts. The evidence is clear: 55% breach rates, 91% of security leaders making compromises they know are dangerous and AI-accelerated attacks that move faster than batch-based detection can respond. Architectures designed for human-speed threats can&#x27;t protect against machine-speed adversaries.\"Modern cybersecurity is about differentiating between acceptable and unacceptable risk,\" says Chaim Mazal, CSO at Gigamon. \"Our research shows where CISOs are drawing that line, highlighting the critical importance of visibility into all data-in-motion to secure complex hybrid cloud infrastructure against today&#x27;s emerging threats. It&#x27;s clear that current approaches aren&#x27;t keeping pace, which is why CISOs must reevaluate tool stacks and reprioritize investments and resources to more confidently secure their infrastructure.\"VentureBeat will be tracking which approaches to hybrid cloud reinvention actually deliver, and which don&#x27;t, in the months ahead.",

          "content": "I kind of wish they’d called it the Z Fold Fold. Samsung is officially announcing the Z TriFold, its much-anticipated foldable with not one, but two hinges. It’ll launch first in Korea on December 12th, with a US launch planned for the first quarter of 2026. There’s no price just yet, but if a phone with one hinge costs $2,000, you should probably start saving your pennies nickels for this one. The TriFold’s inner screen measures 10 inches on the diagonal, with a 2160 x 1584 resolution and a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that goes all the way down to 1Hz. That’s a lot of screen. You can run three apps vertically side by side on it, and even use Samsung’s DeX desktop environment in a standalone mode without a separate display. On paper, the TriFold’s outer screen looks a lot like the one on the Z Fold 7. It’s a 6.5-inch 1080p display with a 21:9 aspect ratio. Each of the TriFold’s three panels has a slightly different thickness. The center panel is the thickest at 4.2mm, and it houses a USB-C port on the bottom edge. The thinnest panel measures just 3.9mm thick, including a physical SIM tray, and the other panel is 4.0mm thick. Those two sides fold inward over the center panel, unlike Huawei’s Mate XT, which folds in a Z shape and uses part of the inner screen when folded. The TriFold measures 12.9mm thick when it’s folded — 4.7mm thicker than a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. It’s also thicker than a Z Fold 7, which is 8.9mm when you fold it, but it’s not far off the previous Z Fold 6 which is 12.1mm folded. Although it folds differently, the Z TriFold is pretty close in size and weight to Huawei’s Mate XT and most recent XTs. The Z TriFold is just a little thicker when folded — 12.9mm versus 12.8mm — and weighs 309 grams compared to the 298g XT. The back panel is a “ceramic-glass fiber-reinforced polymer” designed to resist cracking. The device’s hinges are two different sizes, both with a dual-rail design protected by a titanium housing. Like Samsung’s other foldables, the TriFold is rated IP48 — fully water resistant, but not dust-tight. With all that going on inside the TriFold, Samsung has still managed to squeeze in three rear cameras: a 200-megapixel f/1.7 wide angle; a 12-megapixel ultrawide; and a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto. Both the cover screen and inner screen include a 10-megapixel selfie camera as well. Each of the phone’s panels houses a battery as well, adding up to a 5,600mAh capacity. The whole thing is powered by a Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, like the S25 series, and includes 16GB of RAM. One thing I’m not seeing on the TriFold’s spec sheet? S Pen compatibility. Samsung spokesperson Elise Sembach confirmed to The Verge over email that the TriFold lacks support for the company’s Bluetooth stylus. The Z Fold used to include stylus support, but that ended with the most recent Z Fold 7. In the meantime, Samsung isn’t sharing how much the TriFold will cost — either in Korea or in the US.",

Russia’s military has been silent on the accident, but the missile’s crash was seen and heard for miles around the Dombarovsky air base in Orenburg Oblast near the Russian-Kazakh border. A video posted by the Russian blog site MilitaryRussia.ru on Telegram and widely shared on other social media platforms showed the missile veering off course immediately after launch before cartwheeling upside down, losing power, and then crashing a short distance from the launch site. The missile ejected a component before it hit the ground, perhaps as part of a payload salvage sequence, according to Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva.Read full article Comments",

He had heard from a friend that Chinese companies were recruiting at new rare-earth mining sites in territory administered by the United Wa State Army, Myanmar’s most powerful ethnic armed group, and that workers could earn upwards of $1,400 a month. It was an opportunity too good to pass up in a country where the formal economy has collapsed since the 2021 military coup, and nearly half of the population lives on less than $2 a day. So Sian set off by car for the town of Mong Pawk, then rode a motorbike for hours through the thick forest. Hired for daily wages of approximately $21, he now digs boreholes and installs pipes. It is the first step in a process called in situ leaching, which involves injecting acidic solutions into mountainsides, then collecting the drained solution in plastic-lined pools where solids, like dysprosium and terbium, two of the world’s most sought-after heavy rare-earth metals, settle out. The resulting sediment sludge is then transported to furnaces and burned, producing dry rare earth oxides.Read full article Comments",

Usually crafted around a specific image or product from the company’s ’90s-and-early-2000s heyday—2022’s sweater was Clippy themed, and 2023’s was just the Windows XP Bliss wallpaper in sweater form—the sweaters usually hit the exact combination of dorky/cute/recognizable that makes for a good holiday party conversation starter. Microsoft is reviving the tradition for 2025 after taking a year off, and the design for this year’s flagship $80 sweater is mostly in line with what the company has done in past years. The 2025 “Artifact Holiday Sweater” revives multiple pixelated icons that Windows 3.1-to-XP users will recognize, including Notepad, Reversi, Paint, MS-DOS, Internet Explorer, and even the MSN butterfly logo. Clippy is, once again, front and center, looking happy to be included. Not all of the icons are from Microsoft’s past; a sunglasses-wearing emoji, a “50” in the style of the old flying Windows icon (for Microsoft’s 50th anniversary), and a Minecraft Creeper face all nod to the company’s more modern products. But the only one I really take issue with is on the right sleeve, where Microsoft has stuck a pixelated monochrome icon for its Copilot AI assistant.Read full article Comments",

In a recent earnings call, CDPR VP of Business Development Michał Nowakowski suggested that a rapid release schedule would be enabled in no small part by the team’s transition away from its proprietary REDEngine to the popular Unreal Engine in 2022. At the time, CDPR said the transition to Unreal Engine would “elevate development predictability and efficiency, while simultaneously granting us access to cutting-edge game development tools.” Those considerations seemed especially important in the wake of widespread technical issues with the console versions of Cyberpunk 2077, which CDPR later blamed on REDEngine’s “in-game streaming system.” “We’re happy with how [Unreal Engine] is evolving through the Epic team’s efforts, and how we are learning how to make it work within a huge open-world game, as [The Witcher 4] is meant to be,” Nowakowski said in the recent earnings call. “In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time—as we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between TW4 and TW5, between TW5 and TW6 and so on.”Read full article Comments",

You’ll need to pay for one of the company’s more expensive plans, and even then, Netflix will only cast to older TVs and streaming dongles. The Google Cast system began appearing in apps shortly after the original Chromecast launched in 2013. Since then, Netflix users have been able to start video streams on TVs and streaming boxes from the mobile app. That was vital for streaming targets without their own remote or on-screen interface, but times change. Today, Google has moved beyond the remote-free Chromecast experience, and most TVs have their own standalone Netflix apps. Netflix itself is also allergic to anything that would allow people to share passwords or watch in a new place. Over the last couple of weeks, Netflix updated its app to remove most casting options, mirroring a change in 2019 to kill Apple AirPlay.Read full article Comments",

But then, as everyone knows, just as our darkest hour seemed finally at hand, Optimus Prime was resurrected from death and returned to us! The long-ago Monday when this unprecedented event occurred was the day hope returned—the day everyone, human and machine alike, was united in joy. It truly was a Monday for all of Cybertron—a “Cyber Monday,” if you will. Today in 2025, we pause to recall how the power of the AllSpark and the collective wisdom of the Primes has torn the veil of death, shattering the barrier between the living world and the world beyond—and through that power, Optimus Prime now walks among us again and it’s not weird at all! (Though I think there also might have been, like, some spores or something? I dunno, it was a long time ago.) To show our joy at the greatest transformer’s return as he takes back up the mantle of Autobot leadership from Rodimus Prime—who, let’s face it, kind of sucked anyway—it is time to do what we did on Black Friday but even harder: it is time to engage in more celebratory commerce! Below you’ll find a short curated list of the best deals we could find for Cyber Monday.

Designed and programmed by Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, the game was meant to prove that console-style games of the original Nintendo era could work just as well on PCs. (Later, the onus of proof would often be in the reverse direction.) Also, it had a female protagonist, which Sweeney saw as a notable differentiator at the time. That’s pretty wild to think about in an era of Tomb Raider‘s Lara Croft, Horizon Forbidden West‘s Aloy, Life is Strange‘s Max Caulfield, Returnal‘s Selene Vassos, Control‘s Jesse Faden, The Last of Us‘ Ellie Williams, and a seemingly endless list of others—to say nothing of the fact that many players of all genders who played the games Mass Effect and Cyberpunk 2077 seem to agree that the female protagonist options in those are more compelling than their male alternatives. As wacky as it is to remember that the idea of a female character was seen as exceptional at any point (and with the acknowledgement that this game was nonetheless not the first to do that), it’s still neat to see how forward-thinking Sweeney was in many respects—and not just in terms of cultural norms in gaming.Read full article Comments",

And Gilbert said his return to action-oriented game design today stemmed from his love for modern classics like Binding of Isaac, Nuclear Throne, and Dead Cells. “I mean, I’m certainly mostly known for adventure games, and I have done other stuff, [but] it probably is a little bit of a departure for me,” he told Ars. “While I do enjoy playing narrative games as well, it’s not the only thing I enjoy, and just the idea of making one of these kind of started out as a whim.”Read full article Comments",
