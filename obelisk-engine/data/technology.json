          "content": "OpenAI is teaming up with Nvidia via a “strategic partnership” that will get the ChatGPT-maker more compute and more cash to develop new models on the road to superintelligence. The partnership, announced Monday, will allow OpenAI to “build and deploy at least 10 gigawatts of AI datacenters with NVIDIA systems,” which translates to millions of GPUs that can help power OpenAI’s new models. One of the most important points here, besides more data centers and compute — which are always in high demand for companies like OpenAI — is that as part of the deal, NVIDIA “intends to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI progressively as each gigawatt is deployed,” per the release. The details will be finalized in the next few weeks, according to the companies. Nvidia will now be a “preferred strategic compute and networking partner for [OpenAI’s] AI factory growth plans,” OpenAI said. “Everything starts with compute,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. “Compute infrastructure will be the basis for the economy of the future, and we will utilize what we’re building with NVIDIA to both create new AI breakthroughs and empower people and businesses with them at scale.” Last week, OpenAI said ChatGPT had reached 700 million weekly active users. News of the strategic partnership comes after the January announcement that Microsoft would no longer be the sole compute provider for OpenAI, and that the tech giant would now just have a “right of first refusal” in such cases. Since then, OpenAI has branched out, beginning to build its own data centers and a $300 billion cloud computing deal with Oracle. OpenAI and Microsoft also put out a pointed statement earlier this month that they had signed a “non-binding memorandum of understanding,” adding that they are “actively working to finalize contractual terms in a definitive agreement.” Microsoft has invested over $13 billion in OpenAI, but the companies have had to evolve their partnership as OpenAI grows. The companies have reportedly clashed over the “AGI clause” in their agreement, which would shut Microsoft out of earnings after OpenAI achieves AGI, or the idea of AI that equals or surpasses human intelligence.",

Although California was the early test bed for autonomous driving tech, the much more permissive regulatory environment in the Lone Star State, plus lots of wide, straight roads and mostly good weather, ticked enough boxes to see companies like Waymo and Zoox set up shop there. And earlier this summer, Tesla added itself to the list. Except things haven't exactly gone well. According to Tesla's crash reports, spotted by Brad Templeton over at Forbes, the automaker experienced not one but three crashes, all apparently on its first day of testing on July 1. And as we learned from Tesla CEO Elon Musk later in July during the (not-great) quarterly earnings call, by that time, Tesla had logged a mere 7,000 miles in testing. By contrast, Waymo's crash rate is more than two orders of magnitude lower, with 60 crashes logged over 50 million miles of driving. (Waymo has now logged more than 96 million miles.)Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Generative AI models are far from perfect, but that hasn't stopped businesses and even governments from giving these robots important tasks. But what happens when AI goes bad? Researchers at Google DeepMind spend a lot of time thinking about how generative AI systems can become threats, detailing it all in the company's Frontier Safety Framework. DeepMind recently released version 3.0 of the framework to explore more ways AI could go off the rails, including the possibility that models could ignore user attempts to shut them down. DeepMind's safety framework is based on so-called \"critical capability levels\" (CCLs). These are essentially risk assessment rubrics that aim to measure an AI model's capabilities and define the point at which its behavior becomes dangerous in areas like cybersecurity or biosciences. The document also details the ways developers can address the CCLs DeepMind identifies in their own models. Google and other firms that have delved deeply into generative AI employ a number of techniques to prevent AI from acting maliciously. Although calling an AI \"malicious\" lends it intentionality that fancy estimation architectures don't have. What we're talking about here is the possibility of misuse or malfunction that is baked into the nature of generative AI systems.Read full article Comments",

It's a low-downforce track, with mostly slow corners, similar to Montreal and Monza. Despite the questionable record of the hosting country—something all too many F1 races can also offer, including the three held in the US—I have a soft spot for watching Baku, with its interesting mix of old and new architecture, and it usually puts on a good race. I particularly love the helicopter and drone shots that follow the action with a God's eye view, giving you a glimpse behind the building facades and into this city by the sea. Friday's practice sessions gave the Ferrari-supporting Tifosi something to look forward to, with Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc topping the times for FP2.

          "content": "The last two years have witnessed the hottest one in history, some of the worst wildfire seasons across Canada, Europe and South America and deadly flooding and heat waves throughout the globe. Over that same period, the world’s largest fossil fuel producers have expanded their planned output for the future, setting humanity on an even more dangerous path into a warmer climate. Governments now expect to produce more than twice as much coal, oil and gas in 2030 as would be consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement, according to a report released Monday. That level is slightly higher than what it was in 2023, the last time the biennial Production Gap report was published. The increase is driven by a slower projected phaseout of coal and higher outlook for gas production by some of the top producers, including China and the United States.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Larry Page and Sergey Brin met each other at a graduate student orientation at Stanford in 1996. Both were studying for their PhDs in computer science, and both were interested in analyzing large sets of data. Because the web was growing so rapidly, they decided to start a project to improve the way people found information on the Internet. They weren’t the first to try this. Hand-curated sites like Yahoo had already given way to more algorithmic search engines like AltaVista and Excite, which both started in 1995. These sites attempted to find relevant webpages by analyzing the words on every page. Page and Brin’s technique was different. Their “BackRub” software created a map of all the links that pages had to each other. Pages on a given subject that had many incoming links from other sites were given a higher ranking for that keyword. Higher-ranked pages could then contribute a larger score to any pages they linked to. In a sense, this was a like a crowdsourcing of search: When people put “This is a good place to read about alligators” on a popular site and added a link to a page about alligators, it did a better job of determining that page’s relevance than simply counting the number of times the word appeared on a page.Read full article Comments",
