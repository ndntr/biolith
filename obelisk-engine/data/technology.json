A blog post on Tuesday said the app, currently available on personal accounts via Google’s Search Labs, will allow you to use an Alt + Space shortcut to search for information from the files on your computer, in your Drive, and on the web. The app, which has a Chrome-like install process and requires you to sign in, also comes with Google’s visual search feature, Lens, built in. That means you can select and search for images on your screen, as well as translate text. In one example shared by Google, you can highlight a math problem on your homework and then ask Google’s AI Mode to help you find the answer. Just like Google’s search engine on the web, you can switch between all results, AI Mode, Images, Shopping, and Videos, and more, as well as choose between dark and light mode. It’s similar to the Spotlight on Mac, which can help you search through your files, apps, and the web. Windows has long had a built-in feature that lets you search through your files and the web, but it recently upgraded this capability with the launch of Copilot Plus PCs. Upon downloading the app, Google will plant a search bar directly on your desktop that you can drag anywhere on your screen and resize. You can minimize the search bar by hitting Alt + Space. The app also gives you the option to enable or disable AI Mode, as well as change the shortcut used to open the app by selecting your profile picture and hitting Configurations. You can try out Google’s new app for Windows now by enabling the experiment in Labs. It’s currently only available in English and for users in the US. You’ll need a PC with Windows 10 or up to download it. Update, September 16th: Added more information about the app.",

          "content": "The companies seeking to build larger AI models have been increasingly stymied by a lack of high-quality training data. As tech firms scour the web for more data to feed their models, they could increasingly rely on potentially sensitive user data. A team at Google Research is exploring new techniques to make the resulting large language models (LLMs) less likely to \"memorize\" any of that content. LLMs have non-deterministic outputs, meaning you can't exactly predict what they'll say. While the output varies even for identical inputs, models do sometimes regurgitate something from their training data—if trained with personal data, the output could be a violation of user privacy. In the event copyrighted data makes it into training data (either accidentally or on purpose), its appearance in outputs can cause a different kind of headache for devs. Differential privacy can prevent such memorization by introducing calibrated noise during the training phase. Adding differential privacy to a model comes with drawbacks in terms of accuracy and compute requirements. No one has bothered to figure out the degree to which that alters the scaling laws of AI models until now. The team worked from the assumption that model performance would be primarily affected by the noise-batch ratio, which compares the volume of randomized noise to the size of the original training data.Read full article Comments",

After years of back-and-forth negotiations, Waymo signed “Testing and Operations Pilot Permit” with SFO, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a release. Under the agreement, Waymo will roll out its service to SFO in three phases, including testing vehicles with a human driver, testing without a driver, and eventually beginning commercial service. Waymo will start its tests with employees before eventually inviting members of the public to take trips to and from the airport. Pickups and dropoffs will initially take place at SFO’s Kiss & Fly lot, which is accessible to the terminals via the AirTrain. Waymo operates in five cities, but currently only serves one airport: Phoenix’s Sky Harbor. The company has been locked in negotiations with SFO for several years as it seeks to assure regulators that its vehicles can handle their chaotic environments, with thousands of cars, taxis, shuttles, and passengers constantly intermixing everyday. But airports represent a huge money-making opportunity for robotaxis, with airport trips accounting for an estimated 20 percent of human-driven ridehail car trips. Waymo will need airport access if it hopes to eventually compete with Uber and Lyft — to say nothing of earning enough money to make a profit.",

The president claimed that the extension allows time to finalize a deal that sources told The Wall Street Journal would shift 80 percent ownership to \"an investor consortium including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz.\" Existing ByteDance investors will also join the consortium, including Susquehanna International, KKR, and General Atlantic, the WSJ reported.Read full article Comments",

In a letter dated September 15, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and nine other Congress members noted reports that Boar's Head plans to reopen the Jarratt, Virginia, facility in the coming months. The plant—and particularly the liverwurst product made there—was determined to be the source of a Listeria outbreak that spanned May to September of last year, sickening at least 61 people across 19 states. Of those 61 people, 60 were hospitalized and 10 died. The company recalled more than 7 million pounds of meat. Amid the outbreak, it came to light that inspectors with the US Department of Agriculture had found dozens of stomach-turning sanitation violations at the plant, including mold, condensation dripping on meats, insects, and puddles of blood.Read full article Comments",

Lucid Motors has won in two separate categories. It takes the Sustainable Computing prize for speeding up new car development with a way for engineers to test iterated designs within their existing CAD environment rather than having to switch to a different tool. Lucid also won the Responsible AI prize for using AI to help predict crash testing well before the physical prototype stage—this let Lucid reduce the number of iterations it went through and the test waste and materials it used.Read full article Comments",

The core functionality appears to be solid because it's not trying to do too much. After installation, you can press Alt+Space (or a shortcut of your choice) at any time to bring up a floating Google search bar. Just type your query, and the results page appears in a small window directly below the bar. It can also pull in select Knowledge Graph content, so you may not even have to type the whole query to get the information you need. Microsoft's built-in Windows search functionality is notoriously crummy, and even in this experimental form, Google's Chrome OS-style search experience is better. It's fast, pulling up local files, Drive documents, and installed apps in a single interface. Both local files and Drive are optional, so you can use them only for search if you prefer.

The idea is called \"Cooperative Congestion Management,\" which works by letting a car in traffic inform vehicles behind it. Researchers from Nissan's advanced technology center in Silicon Valley have trialed CCM on I-680 in the Bay Area, logging about 600 miles. Starting with Nissan vehicles equipped with ProPilot Assist, which combines adaptive cruise control and lane keeping, they added the ability for those cars to communicate with each other, informing other cars about their speed and any hazards. On the road, they were able to show that the system reduced hard-braking events by 85 percent and cut time spent stationary in traffic by 70 percent. But we're not talking about platooning—the idea of having road trains of autonomously driven semitrucks networked together and driving in convoy was all the rage a decade ago, but mostly fell from favor once people realized the human truck drivers were needed for more than just the steering, accelerating, and braking bits of the job.Read full article Comments",

In China, people are using DeepSeek to try to decode their fortunes. In her report, Lauren Jackson examined \"faith tech\" apps that cost users up to $70 annually, with some platforms claiming to channel divine communication directly. Some of the apps address what creators describe as an accessibility problem. \"You don't want to disturb your pastor at three in the morning,\" Krista Rogers, a 61-year-old Ohio resident, told the Times about using the YouVersion Bible app and ChatGPT for spiritual questions. The report also examines platforms that go beyond simple scriptural guidance. While a service like ChatwithGod operates as a \"spiritual advisor,\" its conversational nature is convincing enough that users often question whether they are speaking directly with a divine being. As its chief executive told the Times, the most frequent question from users is, \"Is this actually God I am talking to?\"Read full article Comments",

Today, OpenAI's Economic Research Team went a long way toward answering that question, on a population level, releasing a first-of-its-kind National Bureau of Economic Research working paper (in association with Harvard economist David Denning) detailing how people end up using ChatGPT across time and tasks. While other research has sought to estimate this kind of usage data using self-reported surveys, this is the first such paper with direct access to OpenAI's internal user data. As such, it gives us an unprecedented direct window into reliable usage stats for what is still the most popular application of LLMs by far.

Click here for transcript. Currently, every tech company is in a \"slightly different position,\" depending on its specific supply chains, he explained. However, until semiconductor tariffs are announced, \"it's impossible\" for any tech company to make the kind of long-term plans that could help keep consumer prices low as Trump's negotiations with foreign partners and investigations into various products drag on, Brzytwa said.Read full article Comments",

This mission, known as NG-23, is set to arrive at the ISS early Wednesday with 10,827 pounds (4,911 kilograms) of cargo to sustain the lab and its seven-person crew. By a sizable margin, this is the heaviest cargo load transported to the ISS by a commercial resupply mission.

More importantly, it was the first release installed on then-new Apple Silicon Macs, the culmination of a decade-plus of in-house chip design that began with single-core, low-power iPhone and iPad chips and culminated in something powerful enough for the Mac Pro. Today's macOS 26 Tahoe release holds up a translucent, glassy mirror to the Big Sur update. It comes with an all-new look, one that further unifies Apple's design language across all its operating systems.
