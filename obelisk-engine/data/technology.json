          "standfirst": "The German AI startup Black Forest Labs (BFL), founded by former Stability AI engineers, is continuing to build out its suite of open source AI image generators with the release of FLUX.2 [klein], a new pair of small models — one open and one non-commercial — that emphasizes speed and lower compute requirements, with the models generating images in less than a second on a Nvidia GB200. The [klein] series, released yesterday, includes two primary parameter counts: 4 billion (4B) and 9 billion (9B).The model weights are available on Hugging Face and code on Github.While the larger models in the FLUX.2 family ([max] and [pro]), released in November of 2025, chase the limits of photorealism and \"grounding search\" capabilities, [klein] is designed specifically for consumer hardware and latency-critical workflows.In great news for enterprises, the 4B version is available under an Apache 2.0 license, meaning they — or any organization or developer — can use the [klein] models for their commercial purposes without paying BFL or any intermediaries a dime. However, a number of AI image and media creation platforms including Fal.ai have begun offering it for extremely low cost as well through their application programming interfaces (APIs) and as a direct-to-user tool. Already, it&#x27;s won strong praise from early users for its speed. What it lacks for in overall image quality, it seems to make up for in its fast generation capability, open license, affordability and small footprint — benefitting enterprises who want to run image models on their own hardware or at extremely low cost. So how did BFL do it and how can it benefit you? Read on to learn more.The \"Pareto Frontier\" of LatencyThe technical philosophy behind [klein] is what BFL documentation describes as defining the \"Pareto frontier\" for quality versus latency. In simple terms, they have attempted to squeeze the maximum possible visual fidelity into a model small enough to run on a home gaming PC without a noticeable lag.The performance metrics released by the company paint a picture of a model built for interactivity rather than just batch generation. According to Black Forest Labs&#x27; official figures, the [klein] models are capable of generating or editing images in under 0.5 seconds on modern hardware. Even on standard consumer GPUs like an RTX 3090 or 4070, the 4B model is designed to fit comfortably within approximately 13GB of VRAM.This speed is achieved through \"distillation,\" a process where a larger, more complex model \"teaches\" a smaller, more efficient one to approximate its outputs in fewer steps. The distilled [klein] variants require only four steps to generate an image. This effectively turns the generation process from a coffee-break task into a near-instantaneous one, enabling what BFL describes on X (formerly Twitter) as \"developing ideas from 0 → 1\" in real-time.Under the Hood: Unified ArchitectureHistorically, image generation and image editing have often required different pipelines or complex adapters (like ControlNets). FLUX.2 [klein] attempts to unify these. The architecture natively supports text-to-image, single-reference editing, and multi-reference composition without needing to swap models.According to the documentation released on GitHub, the models support:Multi-Reference Editing: Users can upload up to four reference images (or ten in the playground) to guide the style or structure of the output.Hex-Code Color Control: A frequent pain point for designers is getting \"that exact shade of red.\" The new models accept specific hex codes in prompts (e.g., #800020) to force precise color rendering.Structured Prompting: The model parses JSON-like structured inputs for rigorously defined compositions, a feature clearly aimed at programmatic generation and enterprise pipelines.The Licensing Split: Open Weights vs. Open SourceFor startups and developers building on top of BFL’s tech, understanding the licensing landscape of this release is critical. BFL has adopted a split strategy that separates \"hobbyist/research\" use from \"commercial infrastructure.\"FLUX.2 [klein] 4B: Released under Apache 2.0. This is a permissive free software license that allows for commercial use, modification, and redistribution. If you are building a paid app, a SaaS platform, or a game that integrates AI generation, you can use the 4B model royalty-free.FLUX.2 [klein] 9B & [dev]: Released under the FLUX Non-Commercial License. These weights are open for researchers and hobbyists to download and experiment with, but they cannot be used for commercial applications without a separate agreement.This distinction positions the 4B model as a direct competitor to other open-weights models like Stable Diffusion 3 Medium or SDXL, but with a more modern architecture and a permissive license that removes legal ambiguity for startups.Ecosystem Integration: ComfyUI and BeyondBFL is clearly aware that a model is only as good as the tools that run it. Coinciding with the model drop, the team released official workflow templates for ComfyUI, the node-based interface that has become the standard integrated development environment (IDE) for AI artists.The workflows—specifically image_flux2_klein_text_to_image.json and the editing variants—allow users to drag and drop the new capabilities into existing pipelines immediately.Community reaction on social media has centered on this workflow integration and the speed. In a post on X, the official Black Forest Labs account highlighted the model&#x27;s ability to \"rapidly explore a specific aesthetic,\" showcasing a video where the style of an image shifted instantly as the user scrubbed through options.Why It Matters For Enterprise AI Decision-MakersThe release of FLUX.2 [klein] signals a maturation in the generative AI market, moving past the initial phase of novelty into a period defined by utility, integration, and speed.For Lead AI Engineers who are constantly juggling the need to balance speed with quality, this shift is pivotal. These professionals, who manage the full lifecycle of models from data preparation to deployment, often face the daily challenge of integrating rapidly evolving tools into existing workflows. The availability of a distilled 4B model under an Apache 2.0 license offers a practical solution for those focused on rapid deployment and fine-tuning to achieve specific business goals, allowing them to bypass the latency bottlenecks that typically plague high-fidelity image generation.For Senior AI Engineers focused on orchestration and automation, the implications are equally significant. These experts are responsible for building scalable AI pipelines and maintaining model integrity across different environments, often while working under strict budget constraints.The lightweight nature of the [klein] family directly addresses the challenge of implementing efficient systems with limited resources. By utilizing a model that fits within consumer-grade VRAM, orchestration specialists can architect cost-effective, local inference pipelines that avoid the heavy operational costs associated with massive proprietary models.Even for the Director of IT Security, the move toward capable, locally runnable open-weight models offers a distinct advantage. Tasked with protecting the organization from cyber threats and managing security operations with limited resources, reliance on external APIs for sensitive creative workflows can be a vulnerability. A high-quality model that runs locally allows security leaders to sanction AI tools that keep proprietary data within the corporate firewall, balancing the operational demands of the business with the robust security measures they are required to uphold.",

          "title": "How Google’s 'internal RL' could unlock long-horizon AI agents",
          "standfirst": "Researchers at Google have developed a technique that makes it easier for AI models to learn complex reasoning tasks that usually cause LLMs to hallucinate or fall apart. Instead of training LLMs through next-token prediction, their technique, called internal reinforcement learning (internal RL), steers the model’s internal activations toward developing a high-level step-by-step solution for the input problem. Ultimately, this could provide a scalable path for creating autonomous agents that can handle complex reasoning and real-world robotics without needing constant, manual guidance.The limits of next-token predictionReinforcement learning plays a key role in post-training LLMs, particularly for complex reasoning tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, the problem lies in the architecture of these models. LLMs are autoregressive, meaning they generate sequences one token at a time. When these models explore new strategies during training, they do so by making small, random changes to the next single token or action. This exposes a deeper limitation: next-token prediction forces models to search for solutions at the wrong level of abstraction, making long-horizon reasoning inefficient even when the model “knows” what to do.This token-by-token approach works well for basic language modeling but breaks down in long-horizon tasks where rewards are sparse. If the model relies solely on random token-level sampling, the probability of stumbling upon the correct multi-step solution is infinitesimally small, \"on the order of one in a million,\" according to the researchers.The issue isn&#x27;t just that the models get confused; it’s that they get confused at the wrong level. In comments provided to VentureBeat, Yanick Schimpf, a co-author of the paper, notes that in a 20-step task, an agent can get lost in the minute details of a single step, or it can lose track of the overall goal.\"We argue that when facing a problem with some abstract structure... [goal-oriented exploration] is what you want,\" Schimpf said. By solving the problem at the abstract level first, the agent commits to a path, ensuring it doesn&#x27;t \"get lost in one of the reasoning steps\" and fail to complete the broader workflow.To address this, the field has long looked toward hierarchical reinforcement learning. HRL attempts to solve complex problems by decomposing them into a hierarchy of temporally abstract actions (high-level subroutines that represent different stages of the solution) rather than managing a task as a string of tokens. However, discovering these appropriate subroutines remains a longstanding challenge. Current HRL methods often fail to discover proper policies, frequently \"converging to degenerate options\" that do not represent meaningful behaviors. Even sophisticated modern methods like GRPO (a popular RL algorithm used for sparse-reward tasks) fail in complex environments because they cannot effectively bridge the gap between low-level execution and high-level planning. Steering the LLM&#x27;s internal thoughtsTo overcome these limitations, the Google team proposed internal RL. Advanced autoregressive models already \"know\" how to perform complex, multi-step tasks internally, even if they aren&#x27;t explicitly trained to do so. Because these complex behaviors are hidden inside the model&#x27;s residual stream (i.e., the numerical values that carry information through the network&#x27;s layers), the researchers introduced an \"internal neural network controller,\" or metacontroller. Instead of monitoring and changing the output token, the metacontroller controls the model’s behavior by applying changes to the model&#x27;s internal activations in the middle layers.This nudge steers the model into a specific useful state. The base model then automatically generates the sequence of individual steps needed to achieve that goal because it has already seen those patterns during its initial pretraining. The metacontroller operates through unsupervised learning and does not require human-labeled training examples. Instead, the researchers use a self-supervised framework where the model analyzes a full sequence of behavior and works backward to infer the hidden, high-level intent that best explains the actions.During the internal RL phase, the updates are applied to the metacontroller, which shifts training from next-token prediction to learning high-level actions that can lead to the solution.To understand the practical value of this, consider an enterprise agent tasked with code generation. Today, there is a difficult trade-off: You need \"low temperature\" (predictability) to get the syntax right, but \"high temperature\" (creativity) to solve the logic puzzle.\"Internal RL might facilitate this by allowing the model to explore the space of abstract actions, i.e. structuring logic and method calls, while delegating the token-level realization of those actions to the robust, lower-temperature distribution of the base model,\" Schimpf said. The agent explores the solution without breaking the syntax.The researchers investigated two methods for applying this controller. In the first, the base autoregressive model is pretrained on a behavioral dataset and then frozen, while the metacontroller is trained to steer the frozen model&#x27;s residual stream. In the second, the metacontroller and the base model are jointly optimized, with parameters of both networks updated simultaneously. Internal RL in actionTo evaluate the effectiveness of internal RL, the researchers ran experiments across hierarchical environments designed to stump traditional learners. These included a discrete grid world and a continuous control task where a quadrupedal \"ant\" robot must coordinate joint movements. Both environments used sparse rewards with very long action sequences.While baselines like GRPO and CompILE failed to learn the tasks within a million episodes due to the difficulty of credit assignment over long horizons, internal RL achieved high success rates with a small number of training episodes. By choosing high-level goals rather than tiny steps, the metacontroller drastically reduced the search space. This allowed the model to identify which high-level decisions led to success, making credit assignment efficient enough to solve the sparse reward problem.Notably, the researchers found that the \"frozen\" approach was superior. When the base model and metacontroller were co-trained from scratch, the system failed to develop meaningful abstractions. However, applied to a frozen model, the metacontroller successfully discovered key checkpoints without any human labels, perfectly aligning its internal switching mechanism with the ground-truth moments when an agent finished one subgoal and started the next.As the industry currently fixates on reasoning models that output verbose \"chains of thought\" to solve problems, Google’s research points toward a different, perhaps more efficient future.\"Our study joins a growing body of work suggesting that &#x27;internal reasoning&#x27; is not only feasible but potentially more efficient than token-based approaches,\" Schimpf said. \"Moreover, these silent &#x27;thoughts&#x27; can be decoupled from specific input modalities — a property that could be particularly relevant for the future of multi-modal AI.\"If internal reasoning can be guided without being externalized, the future of AI agents may hinge less on prompting strategies and more on how well we can access and steer what models already represent internally. For enterprises betting on autonomous systems that must plan, adapt, and act over long horizons, that shift could matter more than any new reasoning benchmark.",

The metacontroller operates through unsupervised learning and does not require human-labeled training examples. Instead, the researchers use a self-supervised framework where the model analyzes a full sequence of behavior and works backward to infer the hidden, high-level intent that best explains the actions.During the internal RL phase, the updates are applied to the metacontroller, which shifts training from next-token prediction to learning high-level actions that can lead to the solution.To understand the practical value of this, consider an enterprise agent tasked with code generation. Today, there is a difficult trade-off: You need \"low temperature\" (predictability) to get the syntax right, but \"high temperature\" (creativity) to solve the logic puzzle.\"Internal RL might facilitate this by allowing the model to explore the space of abstract actions, i.e. structuring logic and method calls, while delegating the token-level realization of those actions to the robust, lower-temperature distribution of the base model,\" Schimpf said. The agent explores the solution without breaking the syntax.The researchers investigated two methods for applying this controller. In the first, the base autoregressive model is pretrained on a behavioral dataset and then frozen, while the metacontroller is trained to steer the frozen model&#x27;s residual stream. In the second, the metacontroller and the base model are jointly optimized, with parameters of both networks updated simultaneously. Internal RL in actionTo evaluate the effectiveness of internal RL, the researchers ran experiments across hierarchical environments designed to stump traditional learners. These included a discrete grid world and a continuous control task where a quadrupedal \"ant\" robot must coordinate joint movements. Both environments used sparse rewards with very long action sequences.While baselines like GRPO and CompILE failed to learn the tasks within a million episodes due to the difficulty of credit assignment over long horizons, internal RL achieved high success rates with a small number of training episodes. By choosing high-level goals rather than tiny steps, the metacontroller drastically reduced the search space. This allowed the model to identify which high-level decisions led to success, making credit assignment efficient enough to solve the sparse reward problem.Notably, the researchers found that the \"frozen\" approach was superior. When the base model and metacontroller were co-trained from scratch, the system failed to develop meaningful abstractions. However, applied to a frozen model, the metacontroller successfully discovered key checkpoints without any human labels, perfectly aligning its internal switching mechanism with the ground-truth moments when an agent finished one subgoal and started the next.As the industry currently fixates on reasoning models that output verbose \"chains of thought\" to solve problems, Google’s research points toward a different, perhaps more efficient future.\"Our study joins a growing body of work suggesting that &#x27;internal reasoning&#x27; is not only feasible but potentially more efficient than token-based approaches,\" Schimpf said. \"Moreover, these silent &#x27;thoughts&#x27; can be decoupled from specific input modalities — a property that could be particularly relevant for the future of multi-modal AI.\"If internal reasoning can be guided without being externalized, the future of AI agents may hinge less on prompting strategies and more on how well we can access and steer what models already represent internally. For enterprises betting on autonomous systems that must plan, adapt, and act over long horizons, that shift could matter more than any new reasoning benchmark.",

Windscribe Windscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former's no-nonsense privacy and the latter's healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe's server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once. Unfortunately, Windscribe didn't copy the most important part of Proton VPN's free plan — the unlimited data. You're only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn't enough for regular streaming. It's also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways. Private Internet Access Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) has a deeply annoying name — I assume whoever invented it also likes to hop in their Toyota Forward Motion to grab a gallon of Sustaining Cow Extract from the grocery store — but it's a worthwhile VPN whose pricing provides incredible value. Its monthly and yearly plans are good enough, but its three-year plan is the clincher. Not only is it longer than average, but you can continue to renew at the three-year level, so you won't see an unpleasant price jump the first time you re-up. PIA's apps have a dark UI reminiscent of Proton VPN, which is always a good thing. It also supports port forwarding, custom DNS and the use of a SOCKS5 or Shadowsocks proxy as a second step in the VPN connection. You can even set the maximum data packet size to help out a struggling connection, as I cover in my full PIA VPN review. The downside is that your connection will struggle a lot. While well-designed, PIA's apps have a tendency to lag. In my most recent battery of tests, it dragged oddly on my internet in ways that weren't directly reflected in the speed tests. It's also not always capable of unblocking streaming services in other countries, and while its server network offers 152 IP address options in 84 countries, it's heavily bulked out by virtual locations. TunnelBear TunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it's far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month. VyprVPN VyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn't crack the VPN encryption itself). It's also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks. Despite all that, it didn't make the top seven because its connection speeds aren't up to scratch — you'll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits. Norton VPN Norton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It's a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix. This isn't to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won't find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts. What to look for in a VPN Choosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We're here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below. Compatibility: First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren't always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need. Speed: Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use Ookla's speedtest.net). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it's actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it's using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content. Background: Do some outside research into the VPN's origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It's a dealbreaker if you can't figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit. Server network: Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada. Customer Service: I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone. Pricing: Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals. VPN FAQs To wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here. What is a VPN? VPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, but for this list, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity. Whenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online. When you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours. If you're interested in more detail, I've written a whole article on how a VPN works. What are some things VPNs are used for? The three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online. One side effect of borrowing a VPN's IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online. Location spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as certain US states or countries — like the UK — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location. Are VPNs worth it? Whether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It's no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world. With entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries. What information does a VPN hide? A VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship. However, if you share personal information of your own volition, there's nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you're using a VPN. A VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can't do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that's concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up. Are VPNs safe? As far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there's very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before. All that said, there are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, and others that pretend to be independent services while all secretly working off the same backend. Always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it. Can you get a VPN on your phone? Absolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you're free to choose whichever provider you like. What about Google's One VPN? Google One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you're a Google Fi subscriber. That said, I don't recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn't trust it to guard your sensitive information.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "If you're looking to up your privacy game on the internet in the new year, you can do so for a little less than usual thanks to ExpressVPN's latest deal. Its two-year plans are up to 78 percent off right now: the Advanced tier is on sale for $101 for two years, plus four additional free months. That works out to $3.59 per month during the promotional period. We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it's our current pick for best premium VPN. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue. In our review we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100. The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices. The Basic plan is $78 right now for 28 months, down from $363, and the Pro plan is $168, down from $560.

          "content": "If you're looking to up your privacy game on the internet in the new year, you can do so for a little less than usual thanks to ExpressVPN's latest deal. Its two-year plans are up to 78 percent off right now: the Advanced tier is on sale for $101 for two years, plus four additional free months. That works out to $3.59 per month during the promotional period. We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it's our current pick for best premium VPN. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue. In our review we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100. The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices. The Basic plan is $78 right now for 28 months, down from $363, and the Pro plan is $168, down from $560. That's 78 percent and 70 percent off, respectively. All plans carry a 30-day money-back guarantee for new users, so you can try it without committing long term if you’re on the fence.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-up-to-78-percent-off-expressvpn-two-year-plans-180602525.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "CyberGhost is the middle child of the Kape Technologies VPN portfolio, but in quality, it's much closer to ExpressVPN than Private Internet Access. I mainly put it on my best VPN list because it's so cheap, but I wouldn't have done that if it didn't earn its place in other ways — affordable crap is still crap, after all. My universal impression of CyberGhost is a VPN that's not perfect but is always genuinely working to make itself better. It makes decisions based on what will help its users, not to set itself apart in a crowded market. This makes it similar to a lot of other VPNs, but that's not a bad thing — especially at such a low price. Other than its price, the best things about CyberGhost are its intuitive app design, its frictionless user experience and the super-low latencies that make it an ideal pick for gamers. Download speeds are great up close but middling far away. While I love how many servers it's got in Africa and South America, a few too many of them are virtual locations. I'll get into all this and more in the review; feel free to read straight through or use the contents table to find the area that interests you most. Editor's note (1/16/26): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews. Check out how we test VPNs to learn more about the new standards we're using.

There are no needless hurdles in the setup process. All its app designs put the important controls front and center and don't overload you with needless information. I've broken up my thoughts by platform, as CyberGhost is pretty different depending on where you use it. Windows CyberGhost downloads and installs amazingly fast on Windows 11. I didn't even have to grant any permissions. I just opened the .exe, clicked through a licensing agreement and logged into the desktop client. It took about two minutes end-to-end, including time I spent digging around in my password vault. The CyberGhost VPN client for Windows 11. Sam Chapman for Engadget Once inside, you're greeted with a UI that looks an awful lot like Surfshark — and if it's not broken, don't fix it. Options for special servers are on the left, the server list is in the middle and the connection interface is on the right. The arrangement prioritizes the most important controls and keeps clutter to a minimum. The only thing I can find to complain about is that clicking on a country with multiple locations doesn't open the menu to choose between them; instead, you have to click on a hard-to-see arrow to the right of the name. To access any of the special servers, click the appropriate tab in the left window, then choose from the list. Everything connects quickly. A gear icon at the bottom-left leads to all the special features and options, organized into three tabs: General (to do with the VPN app itself), CyberGhost VPN (to do with the VPN connection) and Account (to do with your subscription). The names could be better, but I can't argue with the clear and useful descriptions on each feature. Mac The download process on macOS Sequoia is as easy as it is on Windows 11. CyberGhost walks you through every step, installs its helper tools with minimal fuss and is ready to go out of the box. It's best to download directly from cyberghostvpn.com, since the App Store version is designed for iPads, not desktop computers. Right after launching, the Mac app is pinned to the taskbar. To open it as a separate window, click the arrow button at the top-left. While it's in the taskbar, the only things you can do are connect, disconnect and switch to one of your favorite locations. You can do all that from the standalone window, too, so there's not much reason to ever leave it pinned. CyberGhost's VPN client for macOS Sequoia. Sam Chapman for Engadget The interface on Mac differs from the Windows client in other noticeable ways. For one thing, it's permanently in dark mode, whereas Windows users get to choose between light and dark. There are fewer categories of servers in the left-hand column, with only torrenting (called For Downloading) and streaming options available — you can still connect to NoSpy, but only by going to the Romania location on the main list. Also, the control panel gear is in the exact opposite location, sitting at the top-right of the connection window. The organization of options is also completely different and generally not as useful, with all the actual controls crammed into a single General tab. This happened to me once or twice when my internet connection had no problems. Sam Chapman for Engadget Compounding the sense that CyberGhost didn't give its Mac app as much attention as its Windows app, I kept getting the odd error pictured in the screenshot above. The client would tell me I had no internet connection (my internet was fine) and direct me to run a connection test. This would always turn up all green lights and let me connect without any incident. It rarely tripped me up for more than a moment, but it was still bizarre. Android CyberGhost on Android is streamlined to the extreme, focusing on ease of use above all else. Connections happen quickly, and the server selection is narrowed down, with only the streaming locations getting their own tab. It's nice, but it does sometimes remind me of when I'd clean my room by shoving all the clutter under the bed. CyberGhost connected on an Android phone. Sam Chapman for Engadget That's mainly because tapping the gear at the top-right opens up a preferences menu with a lot more going on than the main screen. Most of the options here aren't too complicated, but the shift is still jarring, especially since Android doesn't do as well as Windows at explaining what everything does. \"Anonymous statistics\" and \"Share network data for troubleshooting\" sound like the same thing to me, and we get nothing on the esoteric concept of Domain Fronting. Still, I'm nitpicking a bit. CyberGhost's Android client does 95 percent of its job very well. Most of the settings aren't necessary anyway, so you can pick your favorite server and be on your way. iOS Much like its Android app, CyberGhost's iOS offering is sleek on the front end, a little cluttered in the back, but overall quite easy to use. Connections happen within seconds. The main page includes a useful option to tap on your current Wi-Fi network and immediately set Smart Rules for it. As with Android, only streaming-optimized servers and favorites are separated from the rest. The main page of CyberGhost's iPhone app. Sam Chapman for Engadget The control panel also looks very similar to what you get on mobile. The apparent clutter comes from simple on-off toggles and more complex submenus being all jumbled up together, but you can use the VPN just fine without engaging with any of it. For the most part, CyberGhost on iOS does a lot to help you and nothing to get in your way. Browser extensions CyberGhost doesn't have a full-service browser extension. If you look for an extension link on the download hub, you won't find anything. What it does have is free proxy add-ons for Chrome and Firefox, which can be used to change your IP address to a new location. However, proxies do not encrypt your traffic, leaving out one of the critical aspects of how a VPN works. The extension library pages for the CyberGhost proxies are vague about this, but they're no substitute for a full VPN. They're free and may be convenient for occasional streaming if they don't get caught, but they aren't secure. CyberGhost speed test I conducted all these tests on a wireless connection using the WireGuard protocol. For each, I selected either a physical server or a virtual location close to its physical source. Here's what each metric means in the table below: Ping, measured in milliseconds (ms), is a measure of latency — how long it takes to send a signal from your device to its destination via the VPN server. Lower pings are better. Since signals can only move so quickly, latency tends to increase with distance. Download speed, measured in megabits per second (Mbps), is what you probably think of as \"internet speed\" — how fast websites load and how much video you can stream without any pause to load. Upload speed, also measured in Mbps, determines the rate at which data travels from your device to its destination. It's useful for posting content, saving files to the cloud, torrenting and two-way video calls. Server location Ping (ms) Increase factor Download speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Upload speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Portland, USA (unprotected) 16 — 58.70 — 5.80 — Seattle, USA (fastest location) 22 1.4x 55.88 4.8 5.60 3.4 New York, USA 155 9.7x 45.43 22.6 5.43 6.4 Montevideo, Uruguay 111 6.9x 46.25 21.2 5.55 4.3 Lisbon, Portugal 328 20.5x 45.60 22.3 4.36 24.8 Johannesburg, South Africa 632 39.5x 34.12 41.9 3.68 36.6 Vientiane, Laos 350 21.9x 38.04 35.2 4.78 17.6 Average 266 16.6x 44.22 24.7 4.90 15.5 CyberGhost's speed test gave me mixed results — mostly good, but with some reasons for caution. To start on the positive side, latency results were excellent. No matter where I went in the world, the numbers only jumped above 400 milliseconds in one place, and that was the Johannesburg server that had problems across the board. CyberGhost's 266 average is significantly better than I got when testing Surfshark, currently the fastest VPN overall. A speed test using the fastest location chosen by the CyberGhost app. Sam Chapman for Engadget Download and upload speeds looked good in my fastest location, Seattle. Using CyberGhost only slowed my browsing by 4.8 percent and dropped my upload rates by 3.4 percent, comparable to most of its leading competitors. At a distance, though, speeds started to falter. Things in New York remained reasonably fast, but with a lot of fluctuation between tests; unlike Seattle, numbers swung between the 30s and 50s. As I virtually traveled the world, I saw more and more swings, plus sharp declines in South Africa (which is always the problem child of VPN servers, for some reason). To put this in perspective, CyberGhost never dragged that much on my browsing speed, and the internet remained usable no matter where I went. It's just slightly more sluggish than my favorite VPNs in every area — except latency, where it soars ahead. CyberGhost security test VPNs need to secure your internet activity against two things: intentional attacks and leaks due to negligence. A VPN should be watertight enough that it never lets your information slip by accident, while also defending your data against outside interference. It's not hard to test whether a provider is meeting these two criteria. First, make sure it's using safe VPN protocols with modern encryption. Second, use an IP address checker to test for DNS, WebRTC and IPv6 leaks. Third, test encryption itself to ensure it's being applied equally to all data packets. Let's get started. VPN protocols CyberGhost supports three different VPN protocols, all of them up-to-date and secure. OpenVPN, available on Windows, Android, Linux and Fire TV, is my typical recommendation, balanced and secured through a multi-decade history of refinement. WireGuard, supported on every platform, is the new hotshot on the block, fast and stable but not quite as rigorously tested as OpenVPN. IKEv2, which works on macOS, iOS and Windows, connects more quickly than the others but isn't open-source. I have some quibbles about how available these protocols are. OpenVPN should always be an option for everybody; leaving it off Apple devices doesn't make sense. I’ve asked CyberGhost about this and will update here when I get a reply. In the meantime, I can't complain about the protocols themselves, which use uncracked encryption ciphers and present no obvious weak points. Leak test I used ipleak.net to check CyberGhost for leaks. There are three likely causes for a VPN to accidentally reveal your real IP address: it failed to account for different IP types (IPv6 leak), a real-time connection went outside the encrypted tunnel (WebRTC leak) or it used a domain name server that an ISP could read (DNS leak). CyberGhost never leaked my real IP address. Sam Chapman for Engadget CyberGhost blocks all IPv6 traffic, so there's no chance of an IPv6 leak. I checked for WebRTC leaks and didn't find any. Likewise, every time I connected to a VPN server and refreshed the page, I saw that server's IP address, proving that CyberGhost isn't leaking. There is one important exception here: whenever you select a different server on your CyberGhost client, it disconnects from that server before connecting to the next one. This means that your data is exposed during the transition. It's annoying, but as long as you remember not to do anything risky while changing locations, you'll be fine. Encryption test For my final test, I used WireShark to capture images of the data packets CyberGhost was routing from my device to its servers. Sure enough, the outer layer of each data stream was encrypted no matter which VPN protocol I used. Ultimately, all my probing showed that CyberGhost is secure against both negligence and interference. How much does CyberGhost cost? CyberGhost sells three different subscriptions, all of them with the same features. The only difference is how long the plan lasts. You can save money overall by signing up for six months or two years at a time, but it costs more upfront. Each plan can be used on seven devices simultaneously. These prices are subject to change. Sam Chapman for Engadget One month of CyberGhost costs $12.99, and it renews automatically at the same price at the end of each billing month. Each monthly renewal comes with a 14-day, money-back guarantee. You can get six months for $41.94 total, which works out to $6.99 per month. At the end of six months, it auto-renews at the same price. The six-month plan comes with a 45-day refund guarantee. Finally, there's the two-year plan, which comes with a lot of fine print. The first time you sign up, it costs $56.94, which gets you a total of 28 months (working out to $2.03 per month). However, after your 28 months are up, all subsequent renewals instead get you a 12-month plan — still for $56.94, but now working out to $4.79 per month. That's still relatively cheap, but not nearly as affordable as some VPNs with perpetual two-year plans. CyberGhost side apps and bundles CyberGhost doesn't have much in the way of additional subscription offers, but that's honestly refreshing. In an age when even the best providers also need to be antiviruses, insurance agents and probably vacuum cleaners, it's nice to see a VPN that's content with just being a VPN. CyberGhost does have a broader \"security suite,\" but it comes at no extra cost and is currently available on Windows only. More info on that in the \"Extra features\" section below. Dedicated IP You can pay an extra $2.50 per month to add a dedicated IP address to your CyberGhost plan. With a dedicated IP, you'll have a stable address whenever you get online through the VPN, which makes it a lot easier to connect to firewall-protected web services. It's also exclusive, so nobody else can get you in trouble by misusing the IP address. Close-reading CyberGhost's privacy policy CyberGhost is located in Romania, which makes it subject to the strict privacy laws of the European Union. It's not legally required to keep tabs on its users or install government backdoors. That's a great start, but to be certain about a company's approach to privacy, it's best to look at its own words. A VPN makes your online activity anonymous to anyone else who tries to look at it, but the VPN itself still has the power to violate your privacy if it chooses. This leads some people to advise against using commercial VPN services at all, though I don't go that far. The best VPNs build in features that make it impossible for them to abuse their access to your web traffic, such as RAM-only servers and full-disk encryption. When trying to determine if you can trust a VPN with your privacy, the first place to look is its official privacy policy. This document lays out everything the VPN does to handle your personally identifiable information (PII). If the provider violates its policy, they can be sued, so it's not in their interest to lie outright in the document. I went over CyberGhost's privacy policy with a fine-toothed comb — it can be found here if you'd like to follow along. It starts with the usual promise of \"uncompromising protection\": CyberGhost swears that \"we are NOT storing connection logs, meaning that we DON'T have any logs tied to your IP address, connection timestamp or session duration\" (all emphasis theirs). That's the standard I'll be checking against: a total lack of any way for CyberGhost to read or share information on its own users. Let's see how it holds up. These may just be words, but they have legal force, at least in civil court. Sam Chapman for Engadget The privacy policy wins early points by clarifying all the data it collects. You can see the whole quote in the screenshot above, but to summarize, any PII (like your email or IP address) will never be connected with anything you do online. Since absolute anonymity is impossible, this is the best we can hope for from a VPN. Later on, the policy clarifies everything CyberGhost might do with personal data, none of which involves turning it over to authorities or selling it to advertisers. The most suspicious reasons given are \"fraud detection/prevention\" and \"To enforce the terms of service,\" but these both relate to kicking users off CyberGhost itself, not tattling on them to the government. The only potential problem comes in the section titled \"Sharing Your Personal Data.\" Here, CyberGhost states that \"we may communicate your personal data to a member of our group of companies,\" meaning all subsidiaries of Kape Technologies. I won't rehash the case against Kape in full — my ExpressVPN review covers it in detail. Suffice to say the only real risk here is that CyberGhost might share PII with another Kape company located in a region with worse privacy laws than Romania or the EU. To me, this isn't a serious concern. First of all, Kape doesn't own any companies based in truly anti-privacy nations like China, India or Russia. Moreover, the privacy policy states that CyberGhost won't share information with any entity not \"located in the EU or another jurisdiction offering equivalent data protection standards.\" Every bit of data gets the same protections. This may mean PII enters a country in the Five/Nine/14 Eyes alliance, but the Eyes only matter if a VPN is already logging data it shouldn't have. It's not that abuse of intelligence-sharing agreements isn't a problem; it's just that the risk it poses starts with the VPN itself, not where it's located. To sum up, I didn't see any red flags or loopholes in the CyberGhost privacy policy. Some clauses could be tightened up, and it always pays to be suspicious, but I'm confident that using this VPN doesn't risk your personal privacy. Independent corroboration CyberGhost has been audited twice by Deloitte Romania, once in 2022 and again in 2024. Following that pattern, I'll be looking out for another one this year. You need an account to read the full audit report, but it's only 10 pages and easy to summarize: the auditors found nothing in CyberGhost's systems that conflicted with its privacy policy. The audit notes CyberGhost's server infrastructure as evidence. All servers are run on RAM with full-disk encryption, making any information they store completely ephemeral. Even if CyberGhost staff wanted to spy on you, they wouldn't see anything. The same goes for third-party hackers. CyberGhost also posts a regular transparency report that lists how often law enforcement has asked it for information. As far as I could find, after hundreds of requests, there's never been a case where CyberGhost provided any information to cops. Can CyberGhost change your virtual location? For this section, I used Netflix to test whether CyberGhost's virtual location changes are detectable by other websites. Ideally, every time I change location with CyberGhost, Netflix would accept it as real and show me the content library from that country. If either of those things doesn't happen within three tests, the VPN has a problem. Since CyberGhost has servers built for streaming, I used those for each of the five locations. You can see my results below. Server location Unblocked Netflix? Changed content? United Kingdom 3/3 3/3 Japan 3/3 3/3 Germany 3/3 3/3 Australia 3/3 3/3 Brazil 3/3 3/3 This test was a smashing success for CyberGhost. Every time, it showed me the proper video library for the location I chose and never once got caught by Netflix's firewalls. It's the best result I've seen in this section since I tested Proton VPN, and that's high praise if you know me. CyberGhost unblocks Netflix Japan, revealing exclusive titles. Sam Chapman for Engadget Investigating CyberGhost's server network CyberGhost has 125 server locations in 100 countries. Of those locations, 75 are real and 50 are virtual, which makes the math easy: CyberGhost's VPN server network is 60 percent bare-metal and 40 percent virtual. That's good, since physical servers let you calculate how much performance will deteriorate over distance — virtual servers are just as safe, but speeds might fluctuate depending on where they really are. Region Countries with servers Total server locations Virtual server locations North America 9 21 5 South America 9 9 9 Europe 45 56 13 Africa 6 6 3 Middle East 6 6 4 Asia 23 23 16 Oceania 2 4 0 Total 100 125 50 Looking at the distribution of servers, we get good news and bad news. The good news is that there really are 100 different countries and territories to choose from, encompassing nearly all the virtual globetrotting you're likely to need. There are also lots of servers in the southern hemisphere, which is often the last place VPNs grow into. There's a wealth of choices in South America, plus several options in Africa and Central Asia. CyberGhost's selection of VPN servers. Sam Chapman for Engadget The bad news is that the distribution of real servers is skewed toward Europe and the United States. None of the nine South American servers are actually located in South America; worse, a large number of them are physically located in Miami. If you're using CyberGhost in Argentina, don't expect top speeds from the Buenos Aires server, since it's actually over 4,000 miles away. CyberGhost's support center does include a list of where the virtual servers are relayed through, but it's not up to date. Extra features of CyberGhost CyberGhost has a few features beyond the VPN itself, though not as many as you might think. Compared to a provider like NordVPN, which goes all in on extra features, CyberGhost's offerings look pretty lean. But that doesn't matter as much if the features work well. Let's see how they do. Kill switch CyberGhost takes an unusual approach to its kill switch. In case you aren't familiar with the term, a kill switch cuts off your internet connection if your link to the VPN ever drops, protecting your anonymity in case of unexpected incidents. Most VPNs let you toggle the kill switch on and off, but on CyberGhost, it's fully engaged 100 percent of the time — except on Windows, where you can turn it on and off as desired. Turning on the kill switch is almost always a good idea, but it's still annoying that Cyberghost gives many of its users no way to turn it off. In rare cases, kill switches can get overzealous, preventing you from getting online even when conditions are safe. It's an odd choice to remove a potential troubleshooting step from the user's control. Split tunneling Split tunneling lets you name some apps or websites that will run unprotected even while the VPN is active. This can help with certain services that refuse to work if they detect a VPN, or alternatively, can protect only one sensitive app or site while the others enjoy faster unprotected speeds. CyberGhost only has full split tunneling on Android. It also offers a slightly different feature called Exceptions on Windows. Android split tunneling works by app, while Exceptions works by URL. In both cases, you choose individual apps or websites to leave out of the VPN. It's limited, but works as advertised. Optimized servers As I mentioned in the Netflix testing section, CyberGhost includes specialized servers designed for specific tasks. Other than the add-on dedicated IP servers, these come in four forms: \"For gaming,\" \"For torrenting,\" \"For streaming\" and \"NoSpy.\" Gaming servers are apparently built to keep latency low, but I couldn't see much difference between them and the normal servers. \"For torrenting\" is called \"For downloading\" on Mac, but it's all the same torrent-optimized servers. These are built to meet the download and upload speed requirements for effectively using P2P filesharing clients. CyberGhost has P2P servers in 86 countries, which makes it a good VPN for torrenting; only the lack of port forwarding keeps it from being truly great. A few of CyberGhost's specialty servers on a MacBook. Sam Chapman for Engadget Each streaming server is built to unblock a specific streaming site in a particular country, occasionally for a single type of device. For example, United States streaming servers are aimed at Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and more, many in their Android or Smart TV forms. UK servers work for Netflix UK, BBC iPlayer, ITV and more. In total, there are 106 streaming servers in 22 countries — not quite as extensive as the overall list, but it's important to remember that non-optimized servers still work fine for streaming. Finally, the NoSpy options connect to a set of servers in Romania that CyberGhost claims to manage entirely in-house, with nobody able to access them except CyberGhost's own team. This is good, but it leaves me suspicious about who's running the rest of the servers. Are they all run by third parties except the NoSpy locations? That's relatively common, but it creates vulnerabilities if the VPN provider doesn't insist on high standards from collaborators. Content blocker CyberGhost's content blocker is underwhelming. All you can do is turn it on and off. There's no customization like you get with Windscribe's R.O.B.E.R.T. and no clear statement of where it's getting its list of domains to block. In practice, it does block in-page ads, but without specifics I couldn't test it in more detail. There's no customization on CyberGhost's blocker -- just turn it on or off. Sam Chapman for Engadget Smart Rules The Smart Rules automation suite is the crown jewel of CyberGhost's features and the most common reason I recommend it. Using Smart Rules, you can automate CyberGhost's behavior to a degree inconceivable on most other VPNs. You can program CyberGhost to take different actions on each of your usual networks. Sam Chapman for Engadget Smart Rules come in two forms: actions performed automatically when CyberGhost launches or connects and actions that respond to new Wi-Fi networks. In the former category, you can set CyberGhost to connect when you open the app, determine which location it connects to and even set an app to automatically open after it connects. Wi-Fi rules depend on whether the network CyberGhost detects is secured or not. For each type of network, you can set the VPN to connect, disconnect, ask you what to do or ignore it entirely. Once it recognizes a Wi-Fi network, you can set specific rules for that network. It's at once very easy to use and capable of surprising depth. CyberGhost customer support options CyberGhost primarily offers customer assistance through its online portal, which can be reached at support.cyberghostvpn.com or by going through the app. If you choose the options \"CyberGhost VPN help\" or \"FAQ\" in the app settings, you'll be taken to the support pages in a browser. I recommend going through the URL, since that takes you to the highest-level page. The support center feels distressingly like an afterthought. Written guides are divided into four sections: Guides, Troubleshooting, FAQs and Announcements. The latter has only one article and the former three are roughly interchangeable — if I'm having trouble connecting to a server, is that an FAQ, a Guide or Troubleshooting? Looking for any particular subject here is a needle-in-a-haystack search. Fortunately, there is a search bar, but this presents its own problems. A simple search for \"connection issues macos\" turned up 72 results, including one called \"Troubleshooting connectivity on macOS\" and another titled \"Troubleshooting VPN connection on mac.\" These two articles are in different sections, but mostly contain the same information, except that the former has an extra walkthrough on renewing your DHCP lease. It's a shame, because the articles themselves are mostly clear and helpful, with lots of well-chosen screenshots. Someone clearly worked hard on the content, but the overall organization left me thinking the knowledgebase was thrown together years ago and hasn't been checked since. Live support experience If you have trouble finding what you need in the written guides, you can get personal support in two ways. One option is to submit an email request through a Zendesk portal. This gives you all the time you need to frame your question and add supporting materials, at the cost of waiting longer for a reply. Your other option is to access live chat, which you can do from anywhere on cyberghost.com by clicking the chat button in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Live chat starts with a \"CyberGhost AI Assistant\" (what we used to call a chatbot in the good old days) which runs you through several diagnostic questions. To its great credit, the bot does not try to link you to articles in the knowledgebase, understanding — as too many providers don't — that nobody tries live chat unless the FAQ isn't working for them. It didn't take me too long to get in touch with what was apparently a live expert. Sam Chapman for Engadget I decided to bother CyberGhost about the connection issue I wrote about in the Mac UI section. Within seconds, the chatbot offered me a button that would transfer me directly to a live agent. I only had to wait about 4 minutes before the agent got in touch. After that, each response took about a minute and explained everything carefully and efficiently. It was as helpful as the written knowledgebase wasn't. CyberGhost background check CyberGhost was founded in 2011 in Bucharest, Romania, where it's still headquartered today. It claims to have around 38 million subscribers and a staff of 70. It appears to be most popular in France and Germany. The only thing that makes me at all uncertain about CyberGhost is that I can't find much information about its history — it doesn't even have a Wikipedia page in English. By far the most likely explanation is that CyberGhost is exactly what it seems to be: a reliable, drama-free VPN provider that doesn't court controversy. Still, I'm naturally paranoid, so I'd understand if this lacuna sends you running back to a better-documented VPN. There is precisely one date in CyberGhost's history that everyone lists: 2017, when it was purchased by Kape Technologies. As a VPN reviewer, I have to think about Kape a lot. My opinion is that the fear around it doesn't measure up to reality. For example, back when it was known as Crossrider, Kape was not a \"malware distributor\"; it sold an ad-injection plugin that turned out to be a useful malware vector. Perhaps Crossrider could have worked harder to stop its platform from being misused, but that doesn't make it a security threat today. Similarly, being owned by a businessman from Israel does not mean that Kape or CyberGhost are secretly controlled by Mossad. I'm not here to defend Kape — I'm just pointing out that a lot of the fear isn't backed up by evidence. To my mind, Kape's consolidation of the VPN industry (it also owns ExpressVPN and Private Internet Access, plus two websites that review VPNs) is bad enough without having to look for additional conspiracies. It's up to you to decide whether or not CyberGhost's parent company presents a hard line you won't cross. Final verdict At the end of my journey with CyberGhost, I may not be blown away, but I'm definitely pleased. After my poor experience with PIA, I was afraid the only budget VPN I could wholeheartedly recommend was a two-year subscription to Surfshark. CyberGhost is a meat-and-potatoes VPN — it's not pushing any envelopes, but it's cheap and it does the job. All that said, I recommend it more to casual users than to people who really need secrecy. There are just enough reddish flags that I wouldn't necessarily trust it with life-and-death information: the (possible) use of third-party managers for all servers outside Romania, the freedom to share information with any Kape subsidiary, the loss of encryption when switching servers. It'll keep you anonymous and let you stream foreign TV for cheap, but you should still choose Proton VPN if you need serious privacy.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/cyberghost-vpn-review-despite-its-flaws-the-value-is-hard-to-beat-200000250.html?src=rss",
          "content": "CyberGhost is the middle child of the Kape Technologies VPN portfolio, but in quality, it's much closer to ExpressVPN than Private Internet Access. I mainly put it on my best VPN list because it's so cheap, but I wouldn't have done that if it didn't earn its place in other ways — affordable crap is still crap, after all. My universal impression of CyberGhost is a VPN that's not perfect but is always genuinely working to make itself better. It makes decisions based on what will help its users, not to set itself apart in a crowded market. This makes it similar to a lot of other VPNs, but that's not a bad thing — especially at such a low price. Other than its price, the best things about CyberGhost are its intuitive app design, its frictionless user experience and the super-low latencies that make it an ideal pick for gamers. Download speeds are great up close but middling far away. While I love how many servers it's got in Africa and South America, a few too many of them are virtual locations. I'll get into all this and more in the review; feel free to read straight through or use the contents table to find the area that interests you most. Editor's note (1/16/26): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews.

There are no needless hurdles in the setup process. All its app designs put the important controls front and center and don't overload you with needless information. I've broken up my thoughts by platform, as CyberGhost is pretty different depending on where you use it. Windows CyberGhost downloads and installs amazingly fast on Windows 11. I didn't even have to grant any permissions. I just opened the .exe, clicked through a licensing agreement and logged into the desktop client. It took about two minutes end-to-end, including time I spent digging around in my password vault. The CyberGhost VPN client for Windows 11. Sam Chapman for Engadget Once inside, you're greeted with a UI that looks an awful lot like Surfshark — and if it's not broken, don't fix it. Options for special servers are on the left, the server list is in the middle and the connection interface is on the right. The arrangement prioritizes the most important controls and keeps clutter to a minimum. The only thing I can find to complain about is that clicking on a country with multiple locations doesn't open the menu to choose between them; instead, you have to click on a hard-to-see arrow to the right of the name. To access any of the special servers, click the appropriate tab in the left window, then choose from the list. Everything connects quickly. A gear icon at the bottom-left leads to all the special features and options, organized into three tabs: General (to do with the VPN app itself), CyberGhost VPN (to do with the VPN connection) and Account (to do with your subscription). The names could be better, but I can't argue with the clear and useful descriptions on each feature. Mac The download process on macOS Sequoia is as easy as it is on Windows 11. CyberGhost walks you through every step, installs its helper tools with minimal fuss and is ready to go out of the box. It's best to download directly from cyberghostvpn.com, since the App Store version is designed for iPads, not desktop computers. Right after launching, the Mac app is pinned to the taskbar. To open it as a separate window, click the arrow button at the top-left. While it's in the taskbar, the only things you can do are connect, disconnect and switch to one of your favorite locations. You can do all that from the standalone window, too, so there's not much reason to ever leave it pinned. CyberGhost's VPN client for macOS Sequoia. Sam Chapman for Engadget The interface on Mac differs from the Windows client in other noticeable ways. For one thing, it's permanently in dark mode, whereas Windows users get to choose between light and dark. There are fewer categories of servers in the left-hand column, with only torrenting (called For Downloading) and streaming options available — you can still connect to NoSpy, but only by going to the Romania location on the main list. Also, the control panel gear is in the exact opposite location, sitting at the top-right of the connection window. The organization of options is also completely different and generally not as useful, with all the actual controls crammed into a single General tab. This happened to me once or twice when my internet connection had no problems. Sam Chapman for Engadget Compounding the sense that CyberGhost didn't give its Mac app as much attention as its Windows app, I kept getting the odd error pictured in the screenshot above. The client would tell me I had no internet connection (my internet was fine) and direct me to run a connection test. This would always turn up all green lights and let me connect without any incident. It rarely tripped me up for more than a moment, but it was still bizarre. Android CyberGhost on Android is streamlined to the extreme, focusing on ease of use above all else. Connections happen quickly, and the server selection is narrowed down, with only the streaming locations getting their own tab. It's nice, but it does sometimes remind me of when I'd clean my room by shoving all the clutter under the bed. CyberGhost connected on an Android phone. Sam Chapman for Engadget That's mainly because tapping the gear at the top-right opens up a preferences menu with a lot more going on than the main screen. Most of the options here aren't too complicated, but the shift is still jarring, especially since Android doesn't do as well as Windows at explaining what everything does. \"Anonymous statistics\" and \"Share network data for troubleshooting\" sound like the same thing to me, and we get nothing on the esoteric concept of Domain Fronting. Still, I'm nitpicking a bit. CyberGhost's Android client does 95 percent of its job very well. Most of the settings aren't necessary anyway, so you can pick your favorite server and be on your way. iOS Much like its Android app, CyberGhost's iOS offering is sleek on the front end, a little cluttered in the back, but overall quite easy to use. Connections happen within seconds. The main page includes a useful option to tap on your current Wi-Fi network and immediately set Smart Rules for it. As with Android, only streaming-optimized servers and favorites are separated from the rest. The main page of CyberGhost's iPhone app. Sam Chapman for Engadget The control panel also looks very similar to what you get on mobile. The apparent clutter comes from simple on-off toggles and more complex submenus being all jumbled up together, but you can use the VPN just fine without engaging with any of it. For the most part, CyberGhost on iOS does a lot to help you and nothing to get in your way. Browser extensions CyberGhost doesn't have a full-service browser extension. If you look for an extension link on the download hub, you won't find anything. What it does have is free proxy add-ons for Chrome and Firefox, which can be used to change your IP address to a new location. However, proxies do not encrypt your traffic, leaving out one of the critical aspects of how a VPN works. The extension library pages for the CyberGhost proxies are vague about this, but they're no substitute for a full VPN. They're free and may be convenient for occasional streaming if they don't get caught, but they aren't secure. CyberGhost speed test I conducted all these tests on a wireless connection using the WireGuard protocol. For each, I selected either a physical server or a virtual location close to its physical source. Here's what each metric means in the table below: Ping, measured in milliseconds (ms), is a measure of latency — how long it takes to send a signal from your device to its destination via the VPN server. Lower pings are better. Since signals can only move so quickly, latency tends to increase with distance. Download speed, measured in megabits per second (Mbps), is what you probably think of as \"internet speed\" — how fast websites load and how much video you can stream without any pause to load. Upload speed, also measured in Mbps, determines the rate at which data travels from your device to its destination. It's useful for posting content, saving files to the cloud, torrenting and two-way video calls. Server location Ping (ms) Increase factor Download speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Upload speed (Mbps) Percentage drop Portland, USA (unprotected) 16 — 58.70 — 5.80 — Seattle, USA (fastest location) 22 1.4x 55.88 4.8 5.60 3.4 New York, USA 155 9.7x 45.43 22.6 5.43 6.4 Montevideo, Uruguay 111 6.9x 46.25 21.2 5.55 4.3 Lisbon, Portugal 328 20.5x 45.60 22.3 4.36 24.8 Johannesburg, South Africa 632 39.5x 34.12 41.9 3.68 36.6 Vientiane, Laos 350 21.9x 38.04 35.2 4.78 17.6 Average 266 16.6x 44.22 24.7 4.90 15.5 CyberGhost's speed test gave me mixed results — mostly good, but with some reasons for caution. To start on the positive side, latency results were excellent. No matter where I went in the world, the numbers only jumped above 400 milliseconds in one place, and that was the Johannesburg server that had problems across the board. CyberGhost's 266 average is significantly better than I got when testing Surfshark, currently the fastest VPN overall. A speed test using the fastest location chosen by the CyberGhost app. Sam Chapman for Engadget Download and upload speeds looked good in my fastest location, Seattle. Using CyberGhost only slowed my browsing by 4.8 percent and dropped my upload rates by 3.4 percent, comparable to most of its leading competitors. At a distance, though, speeds started to falter. Things in New York remained reasonably fast, but with a lot of fluctuation between tests; unlike Seattle, numbers swung between the 30s and 50s. As I virtually traveled the world, I saw more and more swings, plus sharp declines in South Africa (which is always the problem child of VPN servers, for some reason). To put this in perspective, CyberGhost never dragged that much on my browsing speed, and the internet remained usable no matter where I went. It's just slightly more sluggish than my favorite VPNs in every area — except latency, where it soars ahead. CyberGhost security test VPNs need to secure your internet activity against two things: intentional attacks and leaks due to negligence. A VPN should be watertight enough that it never lets your information slip by accident, while also defending your data against outside interference. It's not hard to test whether a provider is meeting these two criteria. First, make sure it's using safe VPN protocols with modern encryption. Second, use an IP address checker to test for DNS, WebRTC and IPv6 leaks. Third, test encryption itself to ensure it's being applied equally to all data packets. Let's get started. VPN protocols CyberGhost supports three different VPN protocols, all of them up-to-date and secure. OpenVPN, available on Windows, Android, Linux and Fire TV, is my typical recommendation, balanced and secured through a multi-decade history of refinement. WireGuard, supported on every platform, is the new hotshot on the block, fast and stable but not quite as rigorously tested as OpenVPN. IKEv2, which works on macOS, iOS and Windows, connects more quickly than the others but isn't open-source. I have some quibbles about how available these protocols are. OpenVPN should always be an option for everybody; leaving it off Apple devices doesn't make sense. I’ve asked CyberGhost about this and will update here when I get a reply. In the meantime, I can't complain about the protocols themselves, which use uncracked encryption ciphers and present no obvious weak points. Leak test I used ipleak.net to check CyberGhost for leaks. There are three likely causes for a VPN to accidentally reveal your real IP address: it failed to account for different IP types (IPv6 leak), a real-time connection went outside the encrypted tunnel (WebRTC leak) or it used a domain name server that an ISP could read (DNS leak). CyberGhost never leaked my real IP address. Sam Chapman for Engadget CyberGhost blocks all IPv6 traffic, so there's no chance of an IPv6 leak. I checked for WebRTC leaks and didn't find any. Likewise, every time I connected to a VPN server and refreshed the page, I saw that server's IP address, proving that CyberGhost isn't leaking. There is one important exception here: whenever you select a different server on your CyberGhost client, it disconnects from that server before connecting to the next one. This means that your data is exposed during the transition. It's annoying, but as long as you remember not to do anything risky while changing locations, you'll be fine. Encryption test For my final test, I used WireShark to capture images of the data packets CyberGhost was routing from my device to its servers. Sure enough, the outer layer of each data stream was encrypted no matter which VPN protocol I used. Ultimately, all my probing showed that CyberGhost is secure against both negligence and interference. How much does CyberGhost cost? CyberGhost sells three different subscriptions, all of them with the same features. The only difference is how long the plan lasts. You can save money overall by signing up for six months or two years at a time, but it costs more upfront. Each plan can be used on seven devices simultaneously. These prices are subject to change. Sam Chapman for Engadget One month of CyberGhost costs $12.99, and it renews automatically at the same price at the end of each billing month. Each monthly renewal comes with a 14-day, money-back guarantee. You can get six months for $41.94 total, which works out to $6.99 per month. At the end of six months, it auto-renews at the same price. The six-month plan comes with a 45-day refund guarantee. Finally, there's the two-year plan, which comes with a lot of fine print. The first time you sign up, it costs $56.94, which gets you a total of 28 months (working out to $2.03 per month). However, after your 28 months are up, all subsequent renewals instead get you a 12-month plan — still for $56.94, but now working out to $4.79 per month. That's still relatively cheap, but not nearly as affordable as some VPNs with perpetual two-year plans. CyberGhost side apps and bundles CyberGhost doesn't have much in the way of additional subscription offers, but that's honestly refreshing. In an age when even the best providers also need to be antiviruses, insurance agents and probably vacuum cleaners, it's nice to see a VPN that's content with just being a VPN. CyberGhost does have a broader \"security suite,\" but it comes at no extra cost and is currently available on Windows only. More info on that in the \"Extra features\" section below. Dedicated IP You can pay an extra $2.50 per month to add a dedicated IP address to your CyberGhost plan. With a dedicated IP, you'll have a stable address whenever you get online through the VPN, which makes it a lot easier to connect to firewall-protected web services. It's also exclusive, so nobody else can get you in trouble by misusing the IP address. Close-reading CyberGhost's privacy policy CyberGhost is located in Romania, which makes it subject to the strict privacy laws of the European Union. It's not legally required to keep tabs on its users or install government backdoors. That's a great start, but to be certain about a company's approach to privacy, it's best to look at its own words. A VPN makes your online activity anonymous to anyone else who tries to look at it, but the VPN itself still has the power to violate your privacy if it chooses. This leads some people to advise against using commercial VPN services at all, though I don't go that far. The best VPNs build in features that make it impossible for them to abuse their access to your web traffic, such as RAM-only servers and full-disk encryption. When trying to determine if you can trust a VPN with your privacy, the first place to look is its official privacy policy. This document lays out everything the VPN does to handle your personally identifiable information (PII). If the provider violates its policy, they can be sued, so it's not in their interest to lie outright in the document. I went over CyberGhost's privacy policy with a fine-toothed comb — it can be found here if you'd like to follow along. It starts with the usual promise of \"uncompromising protection\": CyberGhost swears that \"we are NOT storing connection logs, meaning that we DON'T have any logs tied to your IP address, connection timestamp or session duration\" (all emphasis theirs). That's the standard I'll be checking against: a total lack of any way for CyberGhost to read or share information on its own users. Let's see how it holds up. These may just be words, but they have legal force, at least in civil court. Sam Chapman for Engadget The privacy policy wins early points by clarifying all the data it collects. You can see the whole quote in the screenshot above, but to summarize, any PII (like your email or IP address) will never be connected with anything you do online. Since absolute anonymity is impossible, this is the best we can hope for from a VPN. Later on, the policy clarifies everything CyberGhost might do with personal data, none of which involves turning it over to authorities or selling it to advertisers. The most suspicious reasons given are \"fraud detection/prevention\" and \"To enforce the terms of service,\" but these both relate to kicking users off CyberGhost itself, not tattling on them to the government. The only potential problem comes in the section titled \"Sharing Your Personal Data.\" Here, CyberGhost states that \"we may communicate your personal data to a member of our group of companies,\" meaning all subsidiaries of Kape Technologies. I won't rehash the case against Kape in full — my ExpressVPN review covers it in detail. Suffice to say the only real risk here is that CyberGhost might share PII with another Kape company located in a region with worse privacy laws than Romania or the EU. To me, this isn't a serious concern. First of all, Kape doesn't own any companies based in truly anti-privacy nations like China, India or Russia. Moreover, the privacy policy states that CyberGhost won't share information with any entity not \"located in the EU or another jurisdiction offering equivalent data protection standards.\" Every bit of data gets the same protections. This may mean PII enters a country in the Five/Nine/14 Eyes alliance, but the Eyes only matter if a VPN is already logging data it shouldn't have. It's not that abuse of intelligence-sharing agreements isn't a problem; it's just that the risk it poses starts with the VPN itself, not where it's located. To sum up, I didn't see any red flags or loopholes in the CyberGhost privacy policy. Some clauses could be tightened up, and it always pays to be suspicious, but I'm confident that using this VPN doesn't risk your personal privacy. Independent corroboration CyberGhost has been audited twice by Deloitte Romania, once in 2022 and again in 2024. Following that pattern, I'll be looking out for another one this year. You need an account to read the full audit report, but it's only 10 pages and easy to summarize: the auditors found nothing in CyberGhost's systems that conflicted with its privacy policy. The audit notes CyberGhost's server infrastructure as evidence. All servers are run on RAM with full-disk encryption, making any information they store completely ephemeral. Even if CyberGhost staff wanted to spy on you, they wouldn't see anything. The same goes for third-party hackers. CyberGhost also posts a regular transparency report that lists how often law enforcement has asked it for information. As far as I could find, after hundreds of requests, there's never been a case where CyberGhost provided any information to cops. Can CyberGhost change your virtual location? For this section, I used Netflix to test whether CyberGhost's virtual location changes are detectable by other websites. Ideally, every time I change location with CyberGhost, Netflix would accept it as real and show me the content library from that country. If either of those things doesn't happen within three tests, the VPN has a problem. Since CyberGhost has servers built for streaming, I used those for each of the five locations. You can see my results below. Server location Unblocked Netflix? Changed content? United Kingdom 3/3 3/3 Japan 3/3 3/3 Germany 3/3 3/3 Australia 3/3 3/3 Brazil 3/3 3/3 This test was a smashing success for CyberGhost. Every time, it showed me the proper video library for the location I chose and never once got caught by Netflix's firewalls. It's the best result I've seen in this section since I tested Proton VPN, and that's high praise if you know me. CyberGhost unblocks Netflix Japan, revealing exclusive titles. Sam Chapman for Engadget Investigating CyberGhost's server network CyberGhost has 125 server locations in 100 countries. Of those locations, 75 are real and 50 are virtual, which makes the math easy: CyberGhost's VPN server network is 60 percent bare-metal and 40 percent virtual. That's good, since physical servers let you calculate how much performance will deteriorate over distance — virtual servers are just as safe, but speeds might fluctuate depending on where they really are. Region Countries with servers Total server locations Virtual server locations North America 9 21 5 South America 9 9 9 Europe 45 56 13 Africa 6 6 3 Middle East 6 6 4 Asia 23 23 16 Oceania 2 4 0 Total 100 125 50 Looking at the distribution of servers, we get good news and bad news. The good news is that there really are 100 different countries and territories to choose from, encompassing nearly all the virtual globetrotting you're likely to need. There are also lots of servers in the southern hemisphere, which is often the last place VPNs grow into. There's a wealth of choices in South America, plus several options in Africa and Central Asia. CyberGhost's selection of VPN servers. Sam Chapman for Engadget The bad news is that the distribution of real servers is skewed toward Europe and the United States. None of the nine South American servers are actually located in South America; worse, a large number of them are physically located in Miami. If you're using CyberGhost in Argentina, don't expect top speeds from the Buenos Aires server, since it's actually over 4,000 miles away. CyberGhost's support center does include a list of where the virtual servers are relayed through, but it's not up to date. Extra features of CyberGhost CyberGhost has a few features beyond the VPN itself, though not as many as you might think. Compared to a provider like NordVPN, which goes all in on extra features, CyberGhost's offerings look pretty lean. But that doesn't matter as much if the features work well. Let's see how they do. Kill switch CyberGhost takes an unusual approach to its kill switch. In case you aren't familiar with the term, a kill switch cuts off your internet connection if your link to the VPN ever drops, protecting your anonymity in case of unexpected incidents. Most VPNs let you toggle the kill switch on and off, but on CyberGhost, it's fully engaged 100 percent of the time — except on Windows, where you can turn it on and off as desired. Turning on the kill switch is almost always a good idea, but it's still annoying that Cyberghost gives many of its users no way to turn it off. In rare cases, kill switches can get overzealous, preventing you from getting online even when conditions are safe. It's an odd choice to remove a potential troubleshooting step from the user's control. Split tunneling Split tunneling lets you name some apps or websites that will run unprotected even while the VPN is active. This can help with certain services that refuse to work if they detect a VPN, or alternatively, can protect only one sensitive app or site while the others enjoy faster unprotected speeds. CyberGhost only has full split tunneling on Android. It also offers a slightly different feature called Exceptions on Windows. Android split tunneling works by app, while Exceptions works by URL. In both cases, you choose individual apps or websites to leave out of the VPN. It's limited, but works as advertised. Optimized servers As I mentioned in the Netflix testing section, CyberGhost includes specialized servers designed for specific tasks. Other than the add-on dedicated IP servers, these come in four forms: \"For gaming,\" \"For torrenting,\" \"For streaming\" and \"NoSpy.\" Gaming servers are apparently built to keep latency low, but I couldn't see much difference between them and the normal servers. \"For torrenting\" is called \"For downloading\" on Mac, but it's all the same torrent-optimized servers. These are built to meet the download and upload speed requirements for effectively using P2P filesharing clients. CyberGhost has P2P servers in 86 countries, which makes it a good VPN for torrenting; only the lack of port forwarding keeps it from being truly great. A few of CyberGhost's specialty servers on a MacBook. Sam Chapman for Engadget Each streaming server is built to unblock a specific streaming site in a particular country, occasionally for a single type of device. For example, United States streaming servers are aimed at Netflix, Hulu, Peacock, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and more, many in their Android or Smart TV forms. UK servers work for Netflix UK, BBC iPlayer, ITV and more. In total, there are 106 streaming servers in 22 countries — not quite as extensive as the overall list, but it's important to remember that non-optimized servers still work fine for streaming. Finally, the NoSpy options connect to a set of servers in Romania that CyberGhost claims to manage entirely in-house, with nobody able to access them except CyberGhost's own team. This is good, but it leaves me suspicious about who's running the rest of the servers. Are they all run by third parties except the NoSpy locations? That's relatively common, but it creates vulnerabilities if the VPN provider doesn't insist on high standards from collaborators. Content blocker CyberGhost's content blocker is underwhelming. All you can do is turn it on and off. There's no customization like you get with Windscribe's R.O.B.E.R.T. and no clear statement of where it's getting its list of domains to block. In practice, it does block in-page ads, but without specifics I couldn't test it in more detail. There's no customization on CyberGhost's blocker -- just turn it on or off. Sam Chapman for Engadget Smart Rules The Smart Rules automation suite is the crown jewel of CyberGhost's features and the most common reason I recommend it. Using Smart Rules, you can automate CyberGhost's behavior to a degree inconceivable on most other VPNs. You can program CyberGhost to take different actions on each of your usual networks. Sam Chapman for Engadget Smart Rules come in two forms: actions performed automatically when CyberGhost launches or connects and actions that respond to new Wi-Fi networks. In the former category, you can set CyberGhost to connect when you open the app, determine which location it connects to and even set an app to automatically open after it connects. Wi-Fi rules depend on whether the network CyberGhost detects is secured or not. For each type of network, you can set the VPN to connect, disconnect, ask you what to do or ignore it entirely. Once it recognizes a Wi-Fi network, you can set specific rules for that network. It's at once very easy to use and capable of surprising depth. CyberGhost customer support options CyberGhost primarily offers customer assistance through its online portal, which can be reached at support.cyberghostvpn.com or by going through the app. If you choose the options \"CyberGhost VPN help\" or \"FAQ\" in the app settings, you'll be taken to the support pages in a browser. I recommend going through the URL, since that takes you to the highest-level page. The support center feels distressingly like an afterthought. Written guides are divided into four sections: Guides, Troubleshooting, FAQs and Announcements. The latter has only one article and the former three are roughly interchangeable — if I'm having trouble connecting to a server, is that an FAQ, a Guide or Troubleshooting? Looking for any particular subject here is a needle-in-a-haystack search. Fortunately, there is a search bar, but this presents its own problems. A simple search for \"connection issues macos\" turned up 72 results, including one called \"Troubleshooting connectivity on macOS\" and another titled \"Troubleshooting VPN connection on mac.\" These two articles are in different sections, but mostly contain the same information, except that the former has an extra walkthrough on renewing your DHCP lease. It's a shame, because the articles themselves are mostly clear and helpful, with lots of well-chosen screenshots. Someone clearly worked hard on the content, but the overall organization left me thinking the knowledgebase was thrown together years ago and hasn't been checked since. Live support experience If you have trouble finding what you need in the written guides, you can get personal support in two ways. One option is to submit an email request through a Zendesk portal. This gives you all the time you need to frame your question and add supporting materials, at the cost of waiting longer for a reply. Your other option is to access live chat, which you can do from anywhere on cyberghost.com by clicking the chat button in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Live chat starts with a \"CyberGhost AI Assistant\" (what we used to call a chatbot in the good old days) which runs you through several diagnostic questions. To its great credit, the bot does not try to link you to articles in the knowledgebase, understanding — as too many providers don't — that nobody tries live chat unless the FAQ isn't working for them. It didn't take me too long to get in touch with what was apparently a live expert. Sam Chapman for Engadget I decided to bother CyberGhost about the connection issue I wrote about in the Mac UI section. Within seconds, the chatbot offered me a button that would transfer me directly to a live agent. I only had to wait about 4 minutes before the agent got in touch. After that, each response took about a minute and explained everything carefully and efficiently. It was as helpful as the written knowledgebase wasn't. CyberGhost background check CyberGhost was founded in 2011 in Bucharest, Romania, where it's still headquartered today. It claims to have around 38 million subscribers and a staff of 70. It appears to be most popular in France and Germany. The only thing that makes me at all uncertain about CyberGhost is that I can't find much information about its history — it doesn't even have a Wikipedia page in English. By far the most likely explanation is that CyberGhost is exactly what it seems to be: a reliable, drama-free VPN provider that doesn't court controversy. Still, I'm naturally paranoid, so I'd understand if this lacuna sends you running back to a better-documented VPN. There is precisely one date in CyberGhost's history that everyone lists: 2017, when it was purchased by Kape Technologies. As a VPN reviewer, I have to think about Kape a lot. My opinion is that the fear around it doesn't measure up to reality. For example, back when it was known as Crossrider, Kape was not a \"malware distributor\"; it sold an ad-injection plugin that turned out to be a useful malware vector. Perhaps Crossrider could have worked harder to stop its platform from being misused, but that doesn't make it a security threat today. Similarly, being owned by a businessman from Israel does not mean that Kape or CyberGhost are secretly controlled by Mossad. I'm not here to defend Kape — I'm just pointing out that a lot of the fear isn't backed up by evidence. To my mind, Kape's consolidation of the VPN industry (it also owns ExpressVPN and Private Internet Access, plus two websites that review VPNs) is bad enough without having to look for additional conspiracies. It's up to you to decide whether or not CyberGhost's parent company presents a hard line you won't cross. Final verdict At the end of my journey with CyberGhost, I may not be blown away, but I'm definitely pleased. After my poor experience with PIA, I was afraid the only budget VPN I could wholeheartedly recommend was a two-year subscription to Surfshark. CyberGhost is a meat-and-potatoes VPN — it's not pushing any envelopes, but it's cheap and it does the job. All that said, I recommend it more to casual users than to people who really need secrecy. There are just enough reddish flags that I wouldn't necessarily trust it with life-and-death information: the (possible) use of third-party managers for all servers outside Romania, the freedom to share information with any Kape subsidiary, the loss of encryption when switching servers. It'll keep you anonymous and let you stream foreign TV for cheap, but you should still choose Proton VPN if you need serious privacy.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/cyberghost-vpn-review-despite-its-flaws-the-value-is-hard-to-beat-200000250.html?src=rss",

Since the fall of 2024, the company has been training its AI models to use and navigate computers like a human would, and the coding agent has been the most practical expression of that work, giving developers a way to automate rote programming tasks. Starting today, Anthropic is giving regular people a way to take advantage of those capabilities, with the release of a new preview feature called Claude Cowork.The company is billing Cowork as \"a simpler way for anyone — not just developers — to work with Claude.\" After you give the system access to a folder on your computer, it can read, edit or create new files in that folder on your behalf. Anthropic gives a few different example use cases for Cowork. For instance, you could ask Claude to organize your downloads folder, telling it to rename the files contained within to something that's easier to parse at a glance. Another example: you could use Claude to turn screenshots of receipts and invoices into a spreadsheet for tracking expenses. Cowork can also navigate websites — provided you install Claude’s Chrome plugin — and make can use Anthropic's Connectors framework to access third-party apps like Canva. \"Cowork is designed to make using Claude for new work as simple as possible. You don’t need to keep manually providing context or converting Claude’s outputs into the right format,\" the company said. \"Nor do you have to wait for Claude to finish before offering further ideas or feedback: you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel.\" If the idea of granting Claude access to your computer sounds ill-advised, Anthropic says Claude \"can’t read or edit anything you don’t give it explicit access to.\" However, the company does note the system can \"take potentially destructive actions,\" such as deleting a file that is important to you or misinterpreting your instructions. For that reason, Anthropic suggests it's best to give \"very clear\" guidance to Claude. Anthropic isn’t the first to offer a computer agent. Microsoft, for example, has been pushing Copilot hard for nearly three years, despite seemingly limited adoption. For Anthropic, the challenge will be convincing people these tools are useful where others have failed. The fact Claude Code has been universally loved by programmers may make that task easier. Anthropic briefly made Cowork preview only available to users of its pricey Claude Max subscription.

The company also won't show ads to teens under the age of 18. As for privacy, OpenAI states it won't share or sell your data with advertisers. The company will also give users the option to disable ad personalization and clear the data it uses to generate sponsored responses. \"We’ll always offer a way to not see ads in ChatGPT, including a paid tier that’s ad-free,\" OpenAI adds.

          "standfirst": "Last week at CES, Lego introduced its new Smart Play system, with a tech-packed Smart Brick that can recognize and interact with sets and minifigures. It was unexpected and delightful to see Lego come up with a way to modernize its bricks without the need for apps, screens or AI. So I was a little surprised this week when the Lego Education group announced its latest initiative is the Computer Science and AI Learning Solution. After all, generative AI feels like the antithesis of Lego’s creative values. But Andrew Silwinski, Lego Education’s head of product experience, was quick to defend Lego’s approach, noting that being fluent in the tools behind AI is not about generating sloppy images or music and more about expanding what it means by teaching computer science.“I think most people should probably know that we started working on this before ChatGPT [got big],” Silwinski told Engadget earlier this week. “Some of the ideas that underline AI are really powerful foundational ideas, regardless of the current frontier model that's out this week. Helping children understand probability and statistics, data quality, algorithmic bias, sensors, machine perception. These are really foundational core ideas that go back to the 1970s.” To that end, Lego Education designed courses for grades K-2, 3-5 and 6-8 that incorporate Lego bricks, additional hardware and lessons tailored to introducing the fundamentals of AI as an extension of existing computer science education. The kits are designed for four students to work together, with teacher oversight. Much of this all comes from learnings Lego found in a study it commissioned showing that teachers often find they don’t have the right resources to teach these subjects. The study showed that half of teachers globally say “current resources leave students bored” while nearly half say “computer science isn’t relatable and doesn’t connect to students’ interests or day to day.” Given kids’ familiarity with Lego and the multiple decades of experience Lego Education has in putting courses like this together, it seems like a logical step to push in this direction. In Lego’s materials about the new courses, AI is far from the only subject covered. Coding, looping code, triggering events and sequences, if/then conditionals and more are all on display through the combination of Lego-built models and other hardware to motorize it. It feels more like a computer science course that also introduces concepts of AI rather than something with an end goal of having kids build a chatbot.In fact, Lego set up a number of “red lines” in terms of how it would introduce AI. “No data can ever go across the internet to us or any other third party,” Silwinski said. “And that's a really hard bar if you know anything about AI.” So instead of going to the cloud, everything had to be able to do local inference on, as Silwinski said, “the 10-year-old Chromebooks you’ll see in classrooms.” He added that “kids can train their own machine learning models, and all of that is happening locally in the classroom, and none of that data ever leaves the student's device.”Lego also says that its lessons never anthropomorphize AI, one of the things that is so common in consumer-facing AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini and many more. “One of the things we're seeing a lot of with generative AI tools is children have a tendency to see them as somehow human or almost magical. A lot of it's because of the conversational interface, it abstracts all the mechanics away from the child.” Lego also recognized that it had to build a course that’ll work regardless of a teacher’s fluency in such subjects. So a big part of developing the course was making sure that teachers had the tools they needed to be on top of whatever lessons they’re working on. “When we design and we test the products, we're not the ones testing in the classroom,” Silwinski said. “We give it to a teacher and we provide all of the lesson materials, all of the training, all of the notes, all the presentation materials, everything that they need to be able to teach the lesson.” Lego also took into account the fact that some schools might introduce its students to these things starting in Kindergarten, whereas others might skip to the grade 3-5 or 6-8 sets. To alleviate any bumps in the courses for students or teachers, Lego Education works with school districts and individual schools to make sure there’s an on-ramp for those starting from different places in their fluency.While the idea of “teaching AI” seemed out of character for Lego initially, the approach it’s taking here actually reminds me a bit of Smart Play. With Smart Play, the technology is essentially invisible — kids can just open up a set, start building, and get all the benefits of the new system without having to hook up to an app or a screen. In the same vein, Silwinski said that a lot of the work you can do with the Computer Science and AI kit doesn’t need a screen, particularly the lessons designed for younger kids. And the sets themselves have a mode that acts similar to a mesh, where you connect numerous motors and sensors together to build “incredibly complex interactions and behaviors” without even needing a computer.For educators interested in checking out this latest course, Lego has single kits up for pre-order starting at $339.95; they’ll start shipping in April. That’s the pricing for the K-2 sets, the 3-5 and 6-8 sets are $429.95 and $529.95, respectively. A single kit covers four students. Lego is also selling bundles with six kits, and school districts can also request a quote for bigger orders.

          "title": "Listen Labs raises $69M after viral billboard hiring stunt to scale AI customer interviews",
          "standfirst": "Alfred Wahlforss was running out of options. His startup, Listen Labs, needed to hire over 100 engineers, but competing against Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s $100 million offers seemed impossible. So he spent $5,000 — a fifth of his marketing budget — on a billboard in San Francisco displaying what looked like gibberish: five strings of random numbers.The numbers were actually AI tokens. Decoded, they led to a coding challenge: build an algorithm to act as a digital bouncer at Berghain, the Berlin nightclub famous for rejecting nearly everyone at the door. Within days, thousands attempted the puzzle. 430 cracked it. Some got hired. The winner flew to Berlin, all expenses paid.That unconventional approach has now attracted $69 million in Series B funding, led by Ribbit Capital with participation from Evantic and existing investors Sequoia Capital, Conviction, and Pear VC. The round values Listen Labs at $500 million and brings its total capital to $100 million. In nine months since launch, the company has grown annualized revenue by 15x to eight figures and conducted over one million AI-powered interviews.\"When you obsess over customers, everything else follows,\" Wahlforss said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"Teams that use Listen bring the customer into every decision, from marketing to product, and when the customer is delighted, everyone is.\"Why traditional market research is broken, and what Listen Labs is building to fix itListen&#x27;s AI researcher finds participants, conducts in-depth interviews, and delivers actionable insights in hours, not weeks. The platform replaces the traditional choice between quantitative surveys — which provide statistical precision but miss nuance—and qualitative interviews, which deliver depth but cannot scale.Wahlforss explained the limitation of existing approaches: \"Essentially surveys give you false precision because people end up answering the same question... You can&#x27;t get the outliers. People are actually not honest on surveys.\" The alternative, one-on-one human interviews, \"gives you a lot of depth. You can ask follow up questions. You can kind of double check if they actually know what they&#x27;re talking about. And the problem is you can&#x27;t scale that.\"The platform works in four steps: users create a study with AI assistance, Listen recruits participants from its global network of 30 million people, an AI moderator conducts in-depth interviews with follow-up questions, and results are packaged into executive-ready reports including key themes, highlight reels, and slide decks.What distinguishes Listen&#x27;s approach is its use of open-ended video conversations rather than multiple-choice forms. \"In a survey, you can kind of guess what you should answer, and you have four options,\" Wahlforss said. \"Oh, they probably want me to buy high income. Let me click on that button versus an open ended response. It just generates much more honesty.\"The dirty secret of the $140 billion market research industry: rampant fraudListen finds and qualifies the right participants in its global network of 30 million people. But building that panel required confronting what Wahlforss called \"one of the most shocking things that we&#x27;ve learned when we entered this industry\"—rampant fraud.\"Essentially, there&#x27;s a financial transaction involved, which means there will be bad players,\" he explained. \"We actually had some of the largest companies, some of them have billions in revenue, send us people who claim to be kind of enterprise buyers to our platform and our system immediately detected, like, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud.\"The company built what it calls a \"quality guard\" that cross-references LinkedIn profiles with video responses to verify identity, checks consistency across how participants answer questions, and flags suspicious patterns. The result, according to Wahlforss: \"People talk three times more. They&#x27;re much more honest when they talk about sensitive topics like politics and mental health.\"Emeritus, an online education company that uses Listen, reported that approximately 20% of survey responses previously fell into the fraudulent or low-quality category. With Listen, they reduced this to almost zero. \"We did not have to replace any responses because of fraud or gibberish information,\" said Gabrielli Tiburi, Assistant Manager of Customer Insights at Emeritus.How Microsoft, Sweetgreen, and Chubbies are using AI interviews to build better productsThe speed advantage has proven central to Listen&#x27;s pitch. Traditional customer research at Microsoft could take four to six weeks to generate insights. \"By the time we get to them, either the decision has been made or we lose out on the opportunity to actually influence it,\" said Romani Patel, Senior Research Manager at Microsoft.With Listen, Microsoft can now get insights in days, and in many cases, within hours.The platform has already powered several high-profile initiatives. Microsoft used Listen Labs to collect global customer stories for its 50th anniversary celebration. \"We wanted users to share how Copilot is empowering them to bring their best self forward,\" Patel said, \"and we were able to collect those user video stories within a day.\" Traditionally, that kind of work would have taken six to eight weeks.Simple Modern, an Oklahoma-based drinkware company, used Listen to test a new product concept. The process took about an hour to write questions, an hour to launch the study, and 2.5 hours to receive feedback from 120 people across the country. \"We went from &#x27;Should we even have this product?&#x27; to &#x27;How should we launch it?&#x27;\" said Chris Hoyle, the company&#x27;s Chief Marketing Officer.Chubbies, the shorts brand, achieved a 24x increase in youth research participation—growing from 5 to 120 participants — by using Listen to overcome the scheduling challenges of traditional focus groups with children. \"There&#x27;s school, sports, dinner, and homework,\" explained Lauren Neville, Director of Insights and Innovation. \"I had to find a way to hear from them that fit into their schedules.\"The company also discovered product issues through AI interviews that might have gone undetected otherwise. Wahlforss described how the AI \"through conversations, realized there were like issues with the the kids short line, and decided to, like, interview hundreds of kids. And I understand that there were issues in the liner of the shorts and that they were, like, scratchy, quote, unquote, according to the people interviewed.\" The redesigned product became \"a blockbuster hit.\"The Jevons paradox explains why cheaper research creates more demand, not lessListen Labs is entering a massive but fragmented market. Wahlforss cited research from Andreessen Horowitz estimating the market research industry at roughly $140 billion annually, populated by legacy players — some with more than a billion dollars in revenue — that he believes are vulnerable to disruption.\"There are very much existing budget lines that we are replacing,\" Wahlforss said. \"Why we&#x27;re replacing them is that one, they&#x27;re super costly. Two, they&#x27;re kind of stuck in this old paradigm of choosing between a survey or interview, and they also take months to work with.\"But the more intriguing dynamic may be that AI-powered research doesn&#x27;t just replace existing spending — it creates new demand. Wahlforss invoked the Jevons paradox, an economic principle that occurs when technological advancements make a resource more efficient to use, but increased efficiency leads to increased overall consumption rather than decreased consumption.\"What I&#x27;ve noticed is that as something gets cheaper, you don&#x27;t need less of it. You want more of it,\" Wahlforss explained. \"There&#x27;s infinite demand for customer understanding. So the researchers on the team can do an order of magnitude more research, and also other people who weren&#x27;t researchers before can now do that as part of their job.\"Inside the elite engineering team that built Listen Labs before they had a working toiletListen Labs traces its origins to a consumer app that Wahlforss and his co-founder built after meeting at Harvard. \"We built this consumer app that got 20,000 downloads in one day,\" Wahlforss recalled. \"We had all these users, and we were thinking like, okay, what can we do to get to know them better? And we built this prototype of what Listen is today.\"The founding team brings an unusual pedigree. Wahlforss&#x27;s co-founder \"was the national champion in competitive programming in Germany, and he worked at Tesla Autopilot.\" The company claims that 30% of its engineering team are medalists from the International Olympiad in Informatics — the same competition that produced the founders of Cognition, the AI coding startup.The Berghain billboard stunt generated approximately 5 million views across social media, according to Wahlforss. It reflected the intensity of the talent war in the Bay Area.\"We had to do these things because some of our, like early employees, joined the company before we had a working toilet,\" he said. \"But now we fixed that situation.\"The company grew from 5 to 40 employees in 2024 and plans to reach 150 this year. It hires engineers for non-engineering roles across marketing, growth, and operations — a bet that in the AI era, technical fluency matters everywhere.Synthetic customers and automated decisions: what Listen Labs is building nextWahlforss outlined an ambitious product roadmap that pushes into more speculative territory. The company is building \"the ability to simulate your customers, so you can take all of those interviews we&#x27;ve done, and then extrapolate based on that and create synthetic users or simulated user voices.\"Beyond simulation, Listen aims to enable automated action based on research findings. \"Can you not just make recommendations, but also create spawn agents to either change things in code or some customer churns? Can you give them a discount and try to bring them back?\"Wahlforss acknowledged the ethical implications. \"Obviously, as you said, there&#x27;s kind of ethical concerns there. Of like, automated decision making overall can be bad, but we will have considerable guardrails to make sure that the companies are always in the loop.\"The company already handles sensitive data with care. \"We don&#x27;t train on any of the data,\" Wahlforss said. \"We will also scrub any sensitive PII automatically so the model can detect that. And there are times when, for example, you work with investors, where if you accidentally mention something that could be material, non public information, the AI can actually detect that and remove any information like that.\"How AI could reshape the future of product developmentPerhaps the most provocative implication of Listen&#x27;s model is how it could reshape product development itself. Wahlforss described a customer — an Australian startup — that has adopted what amounts to a continuous feedback loop.\"They&#x27;re based in Australia, so they&#x27;re coding during the day, and then in their night, they&#x27;re releasing a Listen study with an American audience. Listen validates whatever they built during the day, and they get feedback on that. They can then plug that feedback directly into coding tools like Claude Code and iterate.\"The vision extends Y Combinator&#x27;s famous dictum — \"write code, talk to users\" — into an automated cycle. \"Write code is now getting automated. And I think like talk to users will be as well, and you&#x27;ll have this kind of infinite loop where you can start to ship this truly amazing product, almost kind of autonomously.\"Whether that vision materializes depends on factors beyond Listen&#x27;s control — the continued improvement of AI models, enterprise willingness to trust automated research, and whether speed truly correlates with better products. A 2024 MIT study found that 95% of AI pilots fail to move into production, a statistic Wahlforss cited as the reason he emphasizes quality over demos.\"I&#x27;m constantly have to emphasize like, let&#x27;s make sure the quality is there and the details are right,\" he said.But the company&#x27;s growth suggests appetite for the experiment. Microsoft&#x27;s Patel said Listen has \"removed the drudgery of research and brought the fun and joy back into my work.\" Chubbies is now pushing its founder to give everyone in the company a login. Sling Money, a stablecoin payments startup, can create a survey in ten minutes and receive results the same day.\"It&#x27;s a total game changer,\" said Ali Romero, Sling Money&#x27;s marketing manager.Wahlforss has a different phrase for what he&#x27;s building. When asked about the tension between speed and rigor — the long-held belief that moving fast means cutting corners — he cited Nat Friedman, the former GitHub CEO and Listen investor, who keeps a list of one-liners on his website.One of them: \"Slow is fake.\"It&#x27;s an aggressive claim for an industry built on methodological caution.

          "content": "Alfred Wahlforss was running out of options. His startup, Listen Labs, needed to hire over 100 engineers, but competing against Mark Zuckerberg&#x27;s $100 million offers seemed impossible. So he spent $5,000 — a fifth of his marketing budget — on a billboard in San Francisco displaying what looked like gibberish: five strings of random numbers.The numbers were actually AI tokens. Decoded, they led to a coding challenge: build an algorithm to act as a digital bouncer at Berghain, the Berlin nightclub famous for rejecting nearly everyone at the door. Within days, thousands attempted the puzzle. 430 cracked it. Some got hired. The winner flew to Berlin, all expenses paid.That unconventional approach has now attracted $69 million in Series B funding, led by Ribbit Capital with participation from Evantic and existing investors Sequoia Capital, Conviction, and Pear VC. The round values Listen Labs at $500 million and brings its total capital to $100 million. In nine months since launch, the company has grown annualized revenue by 15x to eight figures and conducted over one million AI-powered interviews.\"When you obsess over customers, everything else follows,\" Wahlforss said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"Teams that use Listen bring the customer into every decision, from marketing to product, and when the customer is delighted, everyone is.\"Why traditional market research is broken, and what Listen Labs is building to fix itListen&#x27;s AI researcher finds participants, conducts in-depth interviews, and delivers actionable insights in hours, not weeks. The platform replaces the traditional choice between quantitative surveys — which provide statistical precision but miss nuance—and qualitative interviews, which deliver depth but cannot scale.Wahlforss explained the limitation of existing approaches: \"Essentially surveys give you false precision because people end up answering the same question... You can&#x27;t get the outliers. People are actually not honest on surveys.\" The alternative, one-on-one human interviews, \"gives you a lot of depth. You can ask follow up questions. You can kind of double check if they actually know what they&#x27;re talking about. And the problem is you can&#x27;t scale that.\"The platform works in four steps: users create a study with AI assistance, Listen recruits participants from its global network of 30 million people, an AI moderator conducts in-depth interviews with follow-up questions, and results are packaged into executive-ready reports including key themes, highlight reels, and slide decks.What distinguishes Listen&#x27;s approach is its use of open-ended video conversations rather than multiple-choice forms. \"In a survey, you can kind of guess what you should answer, and you have four options,\" Wahlforss said. \"Oh, they probably want me to buy high income. Let me click on that button versus an open ended response. It just generates much more honesty.\"The dirty secret of the $140 billion market research industry: rampant fraudListen finds and qualifies the right participants in its global network of 30 million people. But building that panel required confronting what Wahlforss called \"one of the most shocking things that we&#x27;ve learned when we entered this industry\"—rampant fraud.\"Essentially, there&#x27;s a financial transaction involved, which means there will be bad players,\" he explained. \"We actually had some of the largest companies, some of them have billions in revenue, send us people who claim to be kind of enterprise buyers to our platform and our system immediately detected, like, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud.\"The company built what it calls a \"quality guard\" that cross-references LinkedIn profiles with video responses to verify identity, checks consistency across how participants answer questions, and flags suspicious patterns. The result, according to Wahlforss: \"People talk three times more. They&#x27;re much more honest when they talk about sensitive topics like politics and mental health.\"Emeritus, an online education company that uses Listen, reported that approximately 20% of survey responses previously fell into the fraudulent or low-quality category. With Listen, they reduced this to almost zero. \"We did not have to replace any responses because of fraud or gibberish information,\" said Gabrielli Tiburi, Assistant Manager of Customer Insights at Emeritus.How Microsoft, Sweetgreen, and Chubbies are using AI interviews to build better productsThe speed advantage has proven central to Listen&#x27;s pitch. Traditional customer research at Microsoft could take four to six weeks to generate insights. \"By the time we get to them, either the decision has been made or we lose out on the opportunity to actually influence it,\" said Romani Patel, Senior Research Manager at Microsoft.With Listen, Microsoft can now get insights in days, and in many cases, within hours.The platform has already powered several high-profile initiatives. Microsoft used Listen Labs to collect global customer stories for its 50th anniversary celebration. \"We wanted users to share how Copilot is empowering them to bring their best self forward,\" Patel said, \"and we were able to collect those user video stories within a day.\" Traditionally, that kind of work would have taken six to eight weeks.Simple Modern, an Oklahoma-based drinkware company, used Listen to test a new product concept. The process took about an hour to write questions, an hour to launch the study, and 2.5 hours to receive feedback from 120 people across the country. \"We went from &#x27;Should we even have this product?&#x27; to &#x27;How should we launch it?&#x27;\" said Chris Hoyle, the company&#x27;s Chief Marketing Officer.Chubbies, the shorts brand, achieved a 24x increase in youth research participation—growing from 5 to 120 participants — by using Listen to overcome the scheduling challenges of traditional focus groups with children. \"There&#x27;s school, sports, dinner, and homework,\" explained Lauren Neville, Director of Insights and Innovation. \"I had to find a way to hear from them that fit into their schedules.\"The company also discovered product issues through AI interviews that might have gone undetected otherwise. Wahlforss described how the AI \"through conversations, realized there were like issues with the the kids short line, and decided to, like, interview hundreds of kids. And I understand that there were issues in the liner of the shorts and that they were, like, scratchy, quote, unquote, according to the people interviewed.\" The redesigned product became \"a blockbuster hit.\"The Jevons paradox explains why cheaper research creates more demand, not lessListen Labs is entering a massive but fragmented market. Wahlforss cited research from Andreessen Horowitz estimating the market research industry at roughly $140 billion annually, populated by legacy players — some with more than a billion dollars in revenue — that he believes are vulnerable to disruption.\"There are very much existing budget lines that we are replacing,\" Wahlforss said. \"Why we&#x27;re replacing them is that one, they&#x27;re super costly. Two, they&#x27;re kind of stuck in this old paradigm of choosing between a survey or interview, and they also take months to work with.\"But the more intriguing dynamic may be that AI-powered research doesn&#x27;t just replace existing spending — it creates new demand. Wahlforss invoked the Jevons paradox, an economic principle that occurs when technological advancements make a resource more efficient to use, but increased efficiency leads to increased overall consumption rather than decreased consumption.\"What I&#x27;ve noticed is that as something gets cheaper, you don&#x27;t need less of it. You want more of it,\" Wahlforss explained. \"There&#x27;s infinite demand for customer understanding. So the researchers on the team can do an order of magnitude more research, and also other people who weren&#x27;t researchers before can now do that as part of their job.\"Inside the elite engineering team that built Listen Labs before they had a working toiletListen Labs traces its origins to a consumer app that Wahlforss and his co-founder built after meeting at Harvard. \"We built this consumer app that got 20,000 downloads in one day,\" Wahlforss recalled. \"We had all these users, and we were thinking like, okay, what can we do to get to know them better? And we built this prototype of what Listen is today.\"The founding team brings an unusual pedigree. Wahlforss&#x27;s co-founder \"was the national champion in competitive programming in Germany, and he worked at Tesla Autopilot.\" The company claims that 30% of its engineering team are medalists from the International Olympiad in Informatics — the same competition that produced the founders of Cognition, the AI coding startup.The Berghain billboard stunt generated approximately 5 million views across social media, according to Wahlforss. It reflected the intensity of the talent war in the Bay Area.\"We had to do these things because some of our, like early employees, joined the company before we had a working toilet,\" he said. \"But now we fixed that situation.\"The company grew from 5 to 40 employees in 2024 and plans to reach 150 this year. It hires engineers for non-engineering roles across marketing, growth, and operations — a bet that in the AI era, technical fluency matters everywhere.Synthetic customers and automated decisions: what Listen Labs is building nextWahlforss outlined an ambitious product roadmap that pushes into more speculative territory. The company is building \"the ability to simulate your customers, so you can take all of those interviews we&#x27;ve done, and then extrapolate based on that and create synthetic users or simulated user voices.\"Beyond simulation, Listen aims to enable automated action based on research findings. \"Can you not just make recommendations, but also create spawn agents to either change things in code or some customer churns? Can you give them a discount and try to bring them back?\"Wahlforss acknowledged the ethical implications. \"Obviously, as you said, there&#x27;s kind of ethical concerns there. Of like, automated decision making overall can be bad, but we will have considerable guardrails to make sure that the companies are always in the loop.\"The company already handles sensitive data with care. \"We don&#x27;t train on any of the data,\" Wahlforss said. \"We will also scrub any sensitive PII automatically so the model can detect that.

          "title": "Kilo launches AI-powered Slack bot that ships code from a chat message",
          "standfirst": "Kilo Code, the open-source AI coding startup backed by GitLab cofounder Sid Sijbrandij, is launching a Slack integration that allows software engineering teams to execute code changes, debug issues, and push pull requests directly from their team chat — without opening an IDE or switching applications.The product, called Kilo for Slack, arrives as the AI-assisted coding market heats up with multibillion-dollar acquisitions and funding rounds. But rather than building another siloed coding assistant, Kilo is making a calculated bet: that the future of AI development tools lies not in locking engineers into a single interface, but in embedding AI capabilities into the fragmented workflows where decisions actually happen.\"Engineering teams don&#x27;t make decisions in IDE sidebars. They make them in Slack,\" Scott Breitenother, Kilo Code&#x27;s co-founder and CEO, said in an interview with VentureBeat. \"The Slackbot allows you to do all this — and more — without leaving Slack.\"The launch also marks a partnership with MiniMax, the Hong Kong-based AI company that recently completed a successful initial public offering. MiniMax&#x27;s M2.1 model will serve as the default model powering Kilo for Slack — a decision the company frames as a statement about the closing gap between open-weight and proprietary frontier models.How Kilo for Slack turns team conversations into pull requests without leaving the chatThe integration operates on a simple premise: Slack threads often contain the context needed to fix a bug or implement a feature, but that context gets lost the moment a developer switches to their code editor.With Kilo for Slack, users mention @Kilo in a Slack thread, and the bot reads the entire conversation, accesses connected GitHub repositories, and either answers questions about the codebase or creates a branch and submits a pull request.A typical interaction might look like this: A product manager reports a bug in a Slack channel. Engineers discuss potential causes. Instead of someone copying the conversation into their IDE and re-explaining the problem to an AI assistant, a developer simply types: \"@Kilo based on this thread, can you implement the fix for the null pointer exception in the Authentication service?\"The bot then spins up a cloud agent, reads the thread context, implements the fix, and pushes a pull request — all visible in Slack.The company says the entire process eliminates the need to copy information between apps or jump between windows — developers can trigger complex code changes with nothing more than a single message in Slack.Why Kilo says Cursor and Claude Code fall short when developers need multi-repo contextKilo&#x27;s launch explicitly positions the product against two leading AI coding tools: Cursor, which raised $2.3 billion at a $29.3 billion valuation in November, and Claude Code, Anthropic&#x27;s agentic coding tool.Breitenother outlined specific limitations he sees in both products&#x27; Slack capabilities.\"The Cursor Slack integration is configured on a single-repository basis per workspace or channel,\" he said. \"As a result, if a Slack thread references multiple repositories, users need to manually switch or reconfigure the integration to pull in that additional context.\"On Anthropic&#x27;s offering, he added: \"Claude Code documentation for Slack shows how Claude can be added to a workspace and respond to mentions using the surrounding conversation context. However, it does not describe persistent, multi-turn thread state or task-level continuity across longer workflows. Each interaction is handled based on the context included at the time of the prompt, rather than maintaining an evolving execution state over time.\"Kilo claims its integration works across multiple repositories simultaneously, maintains conversational context across extended Slack threads, and enables handoffs between Slack, IDEs, cloud agents, and the command-line interface.Kilo picks a Chinese AI company&#x27;s model as its default—and addresses enterprise security concerns head-onPerhaps the most provocative element of the announcement is Kilo&#x27;s choice of default model. MiniMax is headquartered in Shanghai and recently went public in Hong Kong — a lineage that may raise eyebrows among enterprise customers wary of sending proprietary code through Chinese infrastructure.Breitenother addressed the concern directly: \"MiniMax&#x27;s recent Hong Kong IPO drew backing from major global institutional investors, including Baillie Gifford, ADIA, GIC, Mirae Asset, Aspex, and EastSpring. This speaks to strong global confidence in models built for global users.\"He emphasized that MiniMax models are hosted by major U.S.-compliant cloud providers. \"MiniMax M2-series are global leading open-source models, and are hosted by many U.S. compliant cloud providers such as AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex and Microsoft AI Foundry,\" he said. \"In fact, MiniMax models were featured by Matt Garman, the AWS CEO, during this year&#x27;s re:Invent keynote, showing they&#x27;re ready for enterprise use at scale.\"The company stresses that Kilo for Slack is fundamentally model-agnostic. \"Kilo doesn&#x27;t force customers into any single model,\" Breitenother said. \"Enterprise customers choose which models they use, where they&#x27;re hosted, and what fits their security, compliance, and risk requirements. Kilo offers access to more than 500 models, so teams can always choose the right model for the job.\"The decision to default to M2.1 reflects Kilo&#x27;s broader thesis about the AI market. According to the company, the performance gap between open-weight and proprietary models has narrowed from 8 percent to 1.7 percent on several key benchmarks. Breitenother clarified that this figure \"refers to convergence between open and closed models as measured by the Stanford AI Index using major general benchmarks like HumanEval, MATH, and MMLU, not to any specific agentic coding evaluation.\"In third-party evaluations, M2.1 has performed competitively. \"In LMArena, an open platform for community-driven AI benchmarking, M2.1 achieved a number-four ranking, right after OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google,\" Breitenother noted. \"What this shows is that M2.1 competes with frontier models in real-world coding workflows, as judged directly by developers.\"What happens to your code when you @mention an AI bot in SlackFor engineering teams evaluating the tool, a critical question is what happens to sensitive code and conversations when routed through the integration.Breitenother walked through the data flow: \"When someone mentions @Kilo in Slack, Kilo reads only the content of the Slack thread where it&#x27;s mentioned, along with basic metadata needed to understand context. It does not have blanket access to a workspace. Access is governed by Slack&#x27;s standard permission model and the scopes the customer approves during installation.\"For repository access, he added: \"If the request requires code context, Kilo accesses only the GitHub repositories the customer has explicitly connected. It does not index unrelated repos. Permissions mirror the access level granted through GitHub, and Kilo can&#x27;t see anything the user or workspace hasn&#x27;t authorized.\"The company states that data is not used to train models and that output visibility follows existing Slack and GitHub permissions.A particularly thorny question for any AI system that can push code directly to repositories is security. What prevents an AI-generated vulnerability from being merged into production?\"Nothing gets merged automatically,\" Breitenother said. \"When the Kilo Slackbot opens a pull request from a Slack thread, it follows the same guardrails teams already rely on today. The PR goes through existing review workflows and approval processes before anything reaches production.\"He added that Kilo can automatically run its built-in code review feature on AI-generated pull requests, \"flagging potential issues or security concerns before it ever reaches a developer for review.\"The open-source paradox: why Kilo believes giving away its code won&#x27;t kill the businessKilo Code sits in an increasingly common but still tricky position: the open-source company charging for hosted services. The complete IDE extension is open-source under an Apache 2.0 license, but Kilo for Slack is a paid, hosted product.The obvious question: What stops a well-funded competitor — or even a customer — from forking the code and building their own version?\"Forking the code isn&#x27;t what worries us, because the code itself isn&#x27;t the hardest part,\" Breitenother said. \"A competitor could fork the repository tomorrow. What they wouldn&#x27;t get is the infrastructure that safely executes agentic workflows across Slack, GitHub, IDEs, and cloud agents. The experience we&#x27;ve built operating this at scale across many teams and repositories. The trust, integrations, and enterprise-ready controls customers expect out of the box.\"He drew parallels to other successful open-source companies: \"Open core drives adoption and trust, while the hosted product delivers convenience, reliability, and ongoing innovation. Customers aren&#x27;t paying for access to code. They&#x27;re paying for a system that works every day, securely, at scale.\"Inside the $29 billion \"vibe coding\" market that Kilo wants to disruptKilo enters a market that has attracted extraordinary attention and capital over the past year. The practice of using large language models to write and modify code — popularly known as \"vibe coding,\" a term coined by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy in February 2025 — has become a central focus of enterprise AI investment.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella disclosed in April that AI-generated code now accounts for 30 percent of Microsoft&#x27;s codebase. Google acquired senior employees from AI coding startup Windsurf in a $2.4 billion transaction in July. Cursor&#x27;s November funding round valued the company at $29.3 billion.Kilo raised $8 million in seed funding in December 2025 from Breakers, Cota Capital, General Catalyst, Quiet Capital, and Tokyo Black. Sijbrandij, who stepped down as GitLab CEO in 2024 to focus on cancer treatment but remains board chair, contributed early capital and remains involved in day-to-day strategy.Asked about non-compete considerations given GitLab&#x27;s own AI investments, Breitenother was brief: \"There are no non-compete issues. Kilo is building a fundamentally different approach to AI coding.\"Notably, GitLab disclosed in a recent SEC filing that it paid Kilo $1,000 in exchange for a right of first refusal for 10 business days should the startup receive an acquisition proposal before August 2026.When asked to name an enterprise customer using the Slack integration in production, Breitenother declined: \"That&#x27;s not something we can disclose.\"How a 34-person startup plans to outmaneuver OpenAI and Anthropic in AI codingThe most significant threat to Kilo&#x27;s position may come not from other startups but from the frontier AI labs themselves. OpenAI and Anthropic are both building deeper integrations for coding workflows, and both have vastly greater resources.Breitenother argued that Kilo&#x27;s advantage lies in its architecture, not its model performance.\"We don&#x27;t think the long-term moat in AI coding is raw compute or who ships a Slack agent first,\" he said. \"OpenAI and Anthropic are world-class model companies, and they&#x27;ll continue to build impressive capabilities. But Kilo is built around a different thesis: the hard problem isn&#x27;t generating code, it&#x27;s integrating AI into real engineering workflows across tools, repos, and environments.\"He outlined three areas where he believes Kilo can differentiate:\"Workflow depth: Kilo is designed to operate across Slack, IDEs, cloud agents, GitHub, and the CLI, with persistent context and execution. Even with OpenAI or Anthropic Slack-native agents, those agents are still fundamentally model-centric. Kilo is workflow-centric.\"\"Model flexibility: We&#x27;re model-agnostic by design. Teams don&#x27;t have to bet on one frontier model or vendor roadmap. That&#x27;s difficult for companies like OpenAI or Anthropic, whose incentives are naturally aligned with driving usage toward their own models first.\"\"Platform neutrality: Kilo isn&#x27;t trying to pull developers into a closed ecosystem. It fits into the tools teams already use.\"The future of AI-assisted software development may belong to whoever solves the integration problem firstKilo&#x27;s launch reflects a maturing phase in the AI coding market. The initial wave of tools focused on proving that large language models could generate useful code. The current wave is about integration — fitting AI capabilities into the messy reality of how software actually gets built.That reality involves context fragmented across Slack threads, GitHub issues, IDE windows, and command-line sessions. It involves teams that use different models for different tasks and organizations with complex compliance requirements around data residency and model providers.Kilo is betting that the winners in this market will not be the companies with the best models, but those that best solve the integration problem — meeting developers in the tools they already use rather than forcing them into new ones.Kilo for Slack is available now for teams with Kilo Code accounts. Users connect their GitHub repositories through Kilo&#x27;s integrations dashboard, add the Slack integration, and can then mention @Kilo in any channel where the bot has been added. Usage-based pricing matches the rates of whatever model the team selects.Whether a 34-person startup can execute on that vision against competitors with billions in capital remains an open question. But if Breitenother is right that the hard problem in AI coding isn&#x27;t generating code but integrating into workflows, Kilo may have picked the right fight. After all, the best AI in the world doesn&#x27;t matter much if developers have to leave the conversation to use it.",

This speaks to strong global confidence in models built for global users.\"He emphasized that MiniMax models are hosted by major U.S.-compliant cloud providers. \"MiniMax M2-series are global leading open-source models, and are hosted by many U.S. compliant cloud providers such as AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex and Microsoft AI Foundry,\" he said. \"In fact, MiniMax models were featured by Matt Garman, the AWS CEO, during this year&#x27;s re:Invent keynote, showing they&#x27;re ready for enterprise use at scale.\"The company stresses that Kilo for Slack is fundamentally model-agnostic. \"Kilo doesn&#x27;t force customers into any single model,\" Breitenother said. \"Enterprise customers choose which models they use, where they&#x27;re hosted, and what fits their security, compliance, and risk requirements. Kilo offers access to more than 500 models, so teams can always choose the right model for the job.\"The decision to default to M2.1 reflects Kilo&#x27;s broader thesis about the AI market. According to the company, the performance gap between open-weight and proprietary models has narrowed from 8 percent to 1.7 percent on several key benchmarks. Breitenother clarified that this figure \"refers to convergence between open and closed models as measured by the Stanford AI Index using major general benchmarks like HumanEval, MATH, and MMLU, not to any specific agentic coding evaluation.\"In third-party evaluations, M2.1 has performed competitively. \"In LMArena, an open platform for community-driven AI benchmarking, M2.1 achieved a number-four ranking, right after OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google,\" Breitenother noted. \"What this shows is that M2.1 competes with frontier models in real-world coding workflows, as judged directly by developers.\"What happens to your code when you @mention an AI bot in SlackFor engineering teams evaluating the tool, a critical question is what happens to sensitive code and conversations when routed through the integration.Breitenother walked through the data flow: \"When someone mentions @Kilo in Slack, Kilo reads only the content of the Slack thread where it&#x27;s mentioned, along with basic metadata needed to understand context. It does not have blanket access to a workspace. Access is governed by Slack&#x27;s standard permission model and the scopes the customer approves during installation.\"For repository access, he added: \"If the request requires code context, Kilo accesses only the GitHub repositories the customer has explicitly connected. It does not index unrelated repos. Permissions mirror the access level granted through GitHub, and Kilo can&#x27;t see anything the user or workspace hasn&#x27;t authorized.\"The company states that data is not used to train models and that output visibility follows existing Slack and GitHub permissions.A particularly thorny question for any AI system that can push code directly to repositories is security. What prevents an AI-generated vulnerability from being merged into production?\"Nothing gets merged automatically,\" Breitenother said. \"When the Kilo Slackbot opens a pull request from a Slack thread, it follows the same guardrails teams already rely on today. The PR goes through existing review workflows and approval processes before anything reaches production.\"He added that Kilo can automatically run its built-in code review feature on AI-generated pull requests, \"flagging potential issues or security concerns before it ever reaches a developer for review.\"The open-source paradox: why Kilo believes giving away its code won&#x27;t kill the businessKilo Code sits in an increasingly common but still tricky position: the open-source company charging for hosted services. The complete IDE extension is open-source under an Apache 2.0 license, but Kilo for Slack is a paid, hosted product.The obvious question: What stops a well-funded competitor — or even a customer — from forking the code and building their own version?\"Forking the code isn&#x27;t what worries us, because the code itself isn&#x27;t the hardest part,\" Breitenother said. \"A competitor could fork the repository tomorrow. What they wouldn&#x27;t get is the infrastructure that safely executes agentic workflows across Slack, GitHub, IDEs, and cloud agents. The experience we&#x27;ve built operating this at scale across many teams and repositories. The trust, integrations, and enterprise-ready controls customers expect out of the box.\"He drew parallels to other successful open-source companies: \"Open core drives adoption and trust, while the hosted product delivers convenience, reliability, and ongoing innovation. Customers aren&#x27;t paying for access to code. They&#x27;re paying for a system that works every day, securely, at scale.\"Inside the $29 billion \"vibe coding\" market that Kilo wants to disruptKilo enters a market that has attracted extraordinary attention and capital over the past year. The practice of using large language models to write and modify code — popularly known as \"vibe coding,\" a term coined by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy in February 2025 — has become a central focus of enterprise AI investment.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella disclosed in April that AI-generated code now accounts for 30 percent of Microsoft&#x27;s codebase. Google acquired senior employees from AI coding startup Windsurf in a $2.4 billion transaction in July. Cursor&#x27;s November funding round valued the company at $29.3 billion.Kilo raised $8 million in seed funding in December 2025 from Breakers, Cota Capital, General Catalyst, Quiet Capital, and Tokyo Black. Sijbrandij, who stepped down as GitLab CEO in 2024 to focus on cancer treatment but remains board chair, contributed early capital and remains involved in day-to-day strategy.Asked about non-compete considerations given GitLab&#x27;s own AI investments, Breitenother was brief: \"There are no non-compete issues. Kilo is building a fundamentally different approach to AI coding.\"Notably, GitLab disclosed in a recent SEC filing that it paid Kilo $1,000 in exchange for a right of first refusal for 10 business days should the startup receive an acquisition proposal before August 2026.When asked to name an enterprise customer using the Slack integration in production, Breitenother declined: \"That&#x27;s not something we can disclose.\"How a 34-person startup plans to outmaneuver OpenAI and Anthropic in AI codingThe most significant threat to Kilo&#x27;s position may come not from other startups but from the frontier AI labs themselves. OpenAI and Anthropic are both building deeper integrations for coding workflows, and both have vastly greater resources.Breitenother argued that Kilo&#x27;s advantage lies in its architecture, not its model performance.\"We don&#x27;t think the long-term moat in AI coding is raw compute or who ships a Slack agent first,\" he said. \"OpenAI and Anthropic are world-class model companies, and they&#x27;ll continue to build impressive capabilities. But Kilo is built around a different thesis: the hard problem isn&#x27;t generating code, it&#x27;s integrating AI into real engineering workflows across tools, repos, and environments.\"He outlined three areas where he believes Kilo can differentiate:\"Workflow depth: Kilo is designed to operate across Slack, IDEs, cloud agents, GitHub, and the CLI, with persistent context and execution. Even with OpenAI or Anthropic Slack-native agents, those agents are still fundamentally model-centric. Kilo is workflow-centric.\"\"Model flexibility: We&#x27;re model-agnostic by design. Teams don&#x27;t have to bet on one frontier model or vendor roadmap. That&#x27;s difficult for companies like OpenAI or Anthropic, whose incentives are naturally aligned with driving usage toward their own models first.\"\"Platform neutrality: Kilo isn&#x27;t trying to pull developers into a closed ecosystem. It fits into the tools teams already use.\"The future of AI-assisted software development may belong to whoever solves the integration problem firstKilo&#x27;s launch reflects a maturing phase in the AI coding market. The initial wave of tools focused on proving that large language models could generate useful code. The current wave is about integration — fitting AI capabilities into the messy reality of how software actually gets built.That reality involves context fragmented across Slack threads, GitHub issues, IDE windows, and command-line sessions. It involves teams that use different models for different tasks and organizations with complex compliance requirements around data residency and model providers.Kilo is betting that the winners in this market will not be the companies with the best models, but those that best solve the integration problem — meeting developers in the tools they already use rather than forcing them into new ones.Kilo for Slack is available now for teams with Kilo Code accounts. Users connect their GitHub repositories through Kilo&#x27;s integrations dashboard, add the Slack integration, and can then mention @Kilo in any channel where the bot has been added. Usage-based pricing matches the rates of whatever model the team selects.Whether a 34-person startup can execute on that vision against competitors with billions in capital remains an open question. But if Breitenother is right that the hard problem in AI coding isn&#x27;t generating code but integrating into workflows, Kilo may have picked the right fight. After all, the best AI in the world doesn&#x27;t matter much if developers have to leave the conversation to use it.",

          "standfirst": "TikTok is bolstering its age-verification measures across Europe. In the coming weeks, the platform will roll out upgraded age-detection tech in the European Economic Area, as well as in the UK and Switzerland. The systems will assess the likely age of a user based on their profile information and activity. When the tech flags an account that may belong to a user aged under 13 (the minimum age to use TikTok), a specialist moderator will assess whether it should be banned. TikTok will send users in Europe a notification to tell them about these measures and offer them a chance to learn more.Also, if a moderator is looking at content for other reasons and thinks an account might belong to an underage user, they can flag it to a specialist for further review. Anyone can report an account they suspect is used by someone under 13 as well. TikTok says it removes about 6 million underage accounts in total from the platform every month.Those whose accounts are banned can appeal if they think their access was wrongly terminated. Users can then provide a government-approved ID, a credit card authorization or selfie for age estimation (the latter process has not gone well for Roblox as of late, as kids found workarounds for age checks). TikTok acknowledged that there's no single ideal solution to the issue as things stand. \"Despite best efforts, there remains no globally agreed-upon method for effectively confirming a person's age in a way that also preserves their privacy,\" it stated in a blog post. \"At TikTok, we're committed to keeping children under the age of 13 off our platform, providing teens with age-appropriate experiences and continuing to assess and implement a range of solutions. We believe that a multi-layered approach to age assurance — one in which multiple techniques are used — is essential to protecting teens and upholding safety-by-design principles.\"TikTok is rolling out these practices after a pilot in Europe over the last year. That project helped the platform to identify and remove thousands more underage accounts. It worked with the Data Protection Commission (its main privacy regulator in the EU) to help ensure it complied with the bloc’s strict data protection standards.These measures are coming into force amid intensifying calls to keep kids off social media. A social media ban for under 16s in Australia went into effect last month. Affected platforms have collectively closed or restricted millions of accounts as a result. Reddit has filed a lawsuit over the ban. A similar ban might be on the cards in the UK amid public pressure and cross-party support. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said \"all options are on the table\" and that he was watching \"what is happening in Australia.\"The House of Lords is set to vote on proposals for an under-16 social media ban next week.

In the coming weeks, the platform will roll out upgraded age-detection tech in the European Economic Area, as well as in the UK and Switzerland. The systems will assess the likely age of a user based on their profile information and activity. When the tech flags an account that may belong to a user aged under 13 (the minimum age to use TikTok), a specialist moderator will assess whether it should be banned. TikTok will send users in Europe a notification to tell them about these measures and offer them a chance to learn more.Also, if a moderator is looking at content for other reasons and thinks an account might belong to an underage user, they can flag it to a specialist for further review. Anyone can report an account they suspect is used by someone under 13 as well. TikTok says it removes about 6 million underage accounts in total from the platform every month.Those whose accounts are banned can appeal if they think their access was wrongly terminated. Users can then provide a government-approved ID, a credit card authorization or selfie for age estimation (the latter process has not gone well for Roblox as of late, as kids found workarounds for age checks). TikTok acknowledged that there's no single ideal solution to the issue as things stand. \"Despite best efforts, there remains no globally agreed-upon method for effectively confirming a person's age in a way that also preserves their privacy,\" it stated in a blog post. \"At TikTok, we're committed to keeping children under the age of 13 off our platform, providing teens with age-appropriate experiences and continuing to assess and implement a range of solutions. We believe that a multi-layered approach to age assurance — one in which multiple techniques are used — is essential to protecting teens and upholding safety-by-design principles.\"TikTok is rolling out these practices after a pilot in Europe over the last year. That project helped the platform to identify and remove thousands more underage accounts. It worked with the Data Protection Commission (its main privacy regulator in the EU) to help ensure it complied with the bloc’s strict data protection standards.These measures are coming into force amid intensifying calls to keep kids off social media. A social media ban for under 16s in Australia went into effect last month. Affected platforms have collectively closed or restricted millions of accounts as a result. Reddit has filed a lawsuit over the ban. A similar ban might be on the cards in the UK amid public pressure and cross-party support. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said \"all options are on the table\" and that he was watching \"what is happening in Australia.\"The House of Lords is set to vote on proposals for an under-16 social media ban next week. If an amendment passes, members of parliament will hold a binding vote on the matter in the coming months.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/tiktok-tightens-age-verification-across-europe-130000847.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Gone are the days in which you needed to spend a fortune to get a good smartphone. In 2026, features once exclusive to high-end smartphones – big batteries, multi-camera arrays, high refresh rate OLED displays and more – have made their way down to more affordable models. Yes, you’ll still need to buy a flagship smartphone to get the best camera or fastest processor, but you don't have to make nearly as many compromises as you once did if you have a strict budget to adhere to when you go shopping for your next smartphone. If you have less than $600 to spend, let us help you figure out what features to prioritize when trying to find the best midrange smartphone. Table of contents Best midrange phones in 2026 What is a midrange phone? What to consider before buying a midrange smartphone What won't you get from a midrange phone Best midrange phones for 2026 What is a midrange phone? While the term frequently appears in articles and videos, there isn’t an agreed-upon definition for “midrange” beyond a phone that isn’t a flagship or an entry-level option. Most of our recommendations cost between $400 and $600 — any less and you should expect significant compromises. If you have more to spend, you might as well consider flagships like the Apple iPhone 17 and the Samsung Galaxy S25 if you want the best smartphone experience. Devices like Pixel phones often sit in this price range too, offering some of the best value for Android buyers. What to consider before buying a midrange smartphone Buying a new device can be intimidating, but a few questions can help guide you through the process. First: what platform do you want to use? If the answer is iOS, that narrows your options down to exactly one phone. (Thankfully, it’s great.) And if you’re an Android fan, there’s no shortage of compelling options. Both platforms have their strengths, so you shouldn’t rule either out. Of course, also consider how much you’re comfortable spending. Even increasing your budget by $100 more can get you a dramatically better product. Moreover, manufacturers tend to support their more expensive devices for longer with software updates and security updates, so it’s worth buying something toward the top limit of what you can afford. Having an idea of your priorities will help inform your budget. Do you want a long battery life or fast charging? Do you value speedy performance above all else? Or would you like the best possible cameras with high megapixel counts? While they continue to improve every year, even the best midrange smartphones still demand some compromises, and knowing what’s important to you will make choosing one easier. What won’t you get from a midrange smartphone? Every year, the line between midrange and flagship phones blurs as more upmarket features and functions trickle down to more affordable models. When Engadget first published this guide in 2020, it was tricky to find a $500 phone with waterproofing and 5G. In 2026, the biggest thing you might miss out on is wireless charging – and even then, that’s becoming less true. One thing your new phone probably won’t come with is a power adapter; many companies have stopped including chargers with all of their smartphones. Performance has improved in recent years, but can still be hit or miss as most midrange phones use slower processors that can struggle with multitasking. Thankfully, their camera systems have improved dramatically, and you can typically expect at least a dual-lens system on most midrange smartphones below $600 with decent camera quality, selfie performance and software support to keep things running smoothly for years to come.. Midrange smartphone FAQs How long do midrange phones get software updates? Support varies by brand, but most midrange phones receive around three to five years of software and security updates. Apple tends to support iPhones longer while companies like Google and Samsung now promise several years of Android and security patches for their midrange models. Budget-focused brands might offer less so it’s worth checking the update policy before you buy. Are midrange phones good for gaming? Yes, many midrange phones handle gaming well, especially popular titles like Fortnite, Genshin Impact and Call of Duty Mobile. They usually include capable processors, though you won’t always get the smoothest performance in the most demanding mobile games or at max settings. If you play casually or stick to less graphically intensive titles a midrange phone will feel more than adequate.

In its most recent video, the channel states ASUS “explicitly” told it the RTX 5070 Ti is “currently facing a supply shortage.” As a result, the company has “placed the model into end of life status,” and no longer plans to produce it. Hardware Unboxed also spoke to retailers in Australia, who told the channel the 5070 Ti is “no longer available to purchase from partners and distributors,” adding they expect that to be the case throughout at least the first quarter of the year. The 5060 Ti 16GB “is almost done as well,\" with ASUS stating it no longer plans to produce that model going forward either. Both GPUs are 16GB models, making them more expensive to manufacture in the current economic climate.

We continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability,” a NVIDIA spokesperson told Engadget. ASUS did not immediately respond to Engadget’s comment request. After uploading its video, Hardware Unboxed published a clarification. “ASUS did not tell us that NVIDIA said the RTX 5070 Ti has been discontinued. ASUS told us there is very little supply of the 5070 Ti, so their own 5070 Ti products (e.g, the Prime and TUF Gaming) have been put into end of life status,” the channel said. “With retailers also unable to source 5070 Ti SKUs from any AIB, this effectively makes it a dead product.” The AI boom has created an insatiable demand for RAM and other computer components from data center infrastructure companies. In response, many memory manufacturers have shifted their production lines to focus on high bandwidth memory for those clients at the expense of their regular offerings, leading to dramatically increased prices among consumer RAM kits, GPUs and SSDs. In December, Micron Technology announced it would wind down its consumer-facing Crucial brand to focus exclusively on providing components to the AI industry.

          "standfirst": "After a tumultuous 2025 that saw it lose around 4,000 employees, NASA finally has an operating budget for 2026, and one that largely preserves its scientific capabilities. On Thursday, the Senate passed an appropriations bill funding NASA, alongside the National Science Foundation and a handful of other federal agencies. Going into the appropriations process, the president called for a 24 percent year over year reduction to NASA's total operating budget. As part of that plan, the White House wanted to reduce the Science Mission Directorate's funding by nearly half, a move that would have forced NASA to cancel 55 ongoing and planned missions, including efforts like OSIRIS-APEX. The bill effectively rejects President Trump's plan, reducing NASA's total operating budget by just 1.6 percent year over year to $24.4 billion. Per the new appropriations, NASA's science budget will stand at $7.25 billion, 1.1 percent less relative to fiscal 2024, while shuffling the remaining funds to focus on different priorities. For instance, the House and Senate allocated $874 million (+8.7 percent) for the agency's heliophysics work; planetary sciences, which oversees missions like New Horizons, was cut to $2.5 billion (-6.5 percent) compared to 2024. At the same time, NASA's STEM engagement office, which the president proposed eliminating, escaped unscathed with its funding maintained at parity.\"It's almost everything we had been asking for, and it's very encouraging to see a House and Senate run by the president's own party agreeing that we need to keep investing in things like NASA science,\" says Casey Dreier, chief of policy at the Planetary Society, a nonprofit founded by Carl Sagan that advocates for the exploration and study of space. \"It contains very clear and direct language that not only is this funding made available to these projects, but that it will be spent on the initiatives that Congress states.\"Lawmakers also rejected Trump's effort to scuttle the Space Launch System after its third flight. NASA's heavy-lift rocket is billions of dollars over budget, but remains — as of now — the only spacecraft ready to ferry astronauts to the Moon. Compared to the rest of NASA, the fate of the SLS was never really in doubt. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) secured funding for the rocket as part of Trump's Big Beautiful Bill. \"I've been saying for a long time you should never underestimate the political coalition behind the SLS, and I think that was very much validated this year,\" says Dreier. More importantly, it appears the Goddard Space Flight Center will be safe from further damage. Over the summer, the future of the facility, known for its work on projects like the James Webb Space Telescope, was put in jeopardy. By some estimates, the campus has lost a third of its staff due to workforce cuts, and dozens of buildings, including some 100 laboratories, have been shut down by management. One of the casualties was NASA's largest library, which houses irreplaceable documents chronicling the history of the space race. As part of a \"consolidation\" effort, many of those documents will be thrown out.Under the appropriations bill, the Senate has directed NASA to “preserve all the technical and scientific world-class capabilities at Goddard.” It has also instructed the agency to ensure employees of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies are able to continue their work with \"minimal disruption.\" The New York-based office, one of America's leading climate labs, was sent into limbo last spring after the Trump administration moved to shut it down. The bill also provides a lifeline for NASA's to bring back samples of Martian dirt collected by the Perseverance rover. Congress has effectively cancelled the official program tied to that ambition, the Mars Sample Return (MSR), but has set aside $110 million for the agency to continue developing technologies for future science missions to the Red Planet. MSR advocates have argued the mission could lead to significant scientific discoveries, but Dreier notes the program was \"ripe for cancellation\" after it became mired in mismanagement. \"I worry MSR now has this stink of bloat, excess cost and threat of overruns that are really going to make it challenging to restart this without having a dramatically different approach,\" says Dreier, adding that deciding what to do with mission will likely be top of mind for the agency's new administrator, Jared Isaacman. The 2026 budget leaves NASA with fewer resources. Even in areas where Congress allocated the same amount of funds as it did in 2024, the agency will need to do more with less due to inflation. Compared to the absolute blood bath that would have been Trump's proposed budget, a marginal funding cut is the best case scenario given the circumstances, but the circumstances remain less than ideal. \"There will be another presidential budget request coming out in the next couple of months,\" Dreier said. \"They could do this all over again if they wanted to.\"In the immediate future, NASA and its employees are at least protected from the potential fallout of another impending government shutdown. Congress has until January 30 to fully fund the federal government, and as of earlier this week, it has yet to find a way forward on appropriations for agencies like the Department of Labor. Correction 9:05PM ET: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Casey Dreier’s surename as Drier. We regret the error.

On Thursday, the Senate passed an appropriations bill funding NASA, alongside the National Science Foundation and a handful of other federal agencies. Going into the appropriations process, the president called for a 24 percent year over year reduction to NASA's total operating budget. As part of that plan, the White House wanted to reduce the Science Mission Directorate's funding by nearly half, a move that would have forced NASA to cancel 55 ongoing and planned missions, including efforts like OSIRIS-APEX. The bill effectively rejects President Trump's plan, reducing NASA's total operating budget by just 1.6 percent year over year to $24.4 billion. Per the new appropriations, NASA's science budget will stand at $7.25 billion, 1.1 percent less relative to fiscal 2024, while shuffling the remaining funds to focus on different priorities. For instance, the House and Senate allocated $874 million (+8.7 percent) for the agency's heliophysics work; planetary sciences, which oversees missions like New Horizons, was cut to $2.5 billion (-6.5 percent) compared to 2024. At the same time, NASA's STEM engagement office, which the president proposed eliminating, escaped unscathed with its funding maintained at parity.\"It's almost everything we had been asking for, and it's very encouraging to see a House and Senate run by the president's own party agreeing that we need to keep investing in things like NASA science,\" says Casey Dreier, chief of policy at the Planetary Society, a nonprofit founded by Carl Sagan that advocates for the exploration and study of space. \"It contains very clear and direct language that not only is this funding made available to these projects, but that it will be spent on the initiatives that Congress states.\"Lawmakers also rejected Trump's effort to scuttle the Space Launch System after its third flight. NASA's heavy-lift rocket is billions of dollars over budget, but remains — as of now — the only spacecraft ready to ferry astronauts to the Moon. Compared to the rest of NASA, the fate of the SLS was never really in doubt. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) secured funding for the rocket as part of Trump's Big Beautiful Bill. \"I've been saying for a long time you should never underestimate the political coalition behind the SLS, and I think that was very much validated this year,\" says Dreier. More importantly, it appears the Goddard Space Flight Center will be safe from further damage. Over the summer, the future of the facility, known for its work on projects like the James Webb Space Telescope, was put in jeopardy. By some estimates, the campus has lost a third of its staff due to workforce cuts, and dozens of buildings, including some 100 laboratories, have been shut down by management. One of the casualties was NASA's largest library, which houses irreplaceable documents chronicling the history of the space race. As part of a \"consolidation\" effort, many of those documents will be thrown out.Under the appropriations bill, the Senate has directed NASA to “preserve all the technical and scientific world-class capabilities at Goddard.” It has also instructed the agency to ensure employees of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies are able to continue their work with \"minimal disruption.\" The New York-based office, one of America's leading climate labs, was sent into limbo last spring after the Trump administration moved to shut it down. The bill also provides a lifeline for NASA's to bring back samples of Martian dirt collected by the Perseverance rover. Congress has effectively cancelled the official program tied to that ambition, the Mars Sample Return (MSR), but has set aside $110 million for the agency to continue developing technologies for future science missions to the Red Planet. MSR advocates have argued the mission could lead to significant scientific discoveries, but Dreier notes the program was \"ripe for cancellation\" after it became mired in mismanagement. \"I worry MSR now has this stink of bloat, excess cost and threat of overruns that are really going to make it challenging to restart this without having a dramatically different approach,\" says Dreier, adding that deciding what to do with mission will likely be top of mind for the agency's new administrator, Jared Isaacman. The 2026 budget leaves NASA with fewer resources. Even in areas where Congress allocated the same amount of funds as it did in 2024, the agency will need to do more with less due to inflation. Compared to the absolute blood bath that would have been Trump's proposed budget, a marginal funding cut is the best case scenario given the circumstances, but the circumstances remain less than ideal. \"There will be another presidential budget request coming out in the next couple of months,\" Dreier said. \"They could do this all over again if they wanted to.\"In the immediate future, NASA and its employees are at least protected from the potential fallout of another impending government shutdown. Congress has until January 30 to fully fund the federal government, and as of earlier this week, it has yet to find a way forward on appropriations for agencies like the Department of Labor. Correction 9:05PM ET: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Casey Dreier’s surename as Drier. We regret the error.

          "standfirst": "Now would be a good time to update all your Bluetooth audio devices. On Thursday, Wired reported on a security flaw in 17 headphone and speaker models that could allow hackers to access your devices, including their microphones. The vulnerability stems from a faulty implementation of Google's one-tap (Fast Pair) protocol.Security researchers at Belgium's KU Leuven University Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography group, who discovered the security hole, named the flaw WhisperPair. They say a hacker within Bluetooth range would only require the accessory's (easily attainable) device model number and a few seconds.\"You're walking down the street with your headphones on, you're listening to some music. In less than 15 seconds, we can hijack your device,\" KU Leuven researcher Sayon Duttagupta told Wired. \"Which means that I can turn on the microphone and listen to your ambient sound. I can inject audio. I can track your location.\" The researchers notified Google about WhisperPair in August, and the company has been working with them since then.Fast Pair is supposed to only allow new connections while the audio device is in pairing mode. (A proper implementation of this would have prevented this flaw.) But a Google spokesperson told Engadget that the vulnerability stemmed from an improper implementation of Fast Pair by some of its hardware partners. This could then allow a hacker's device to pair with your headphones or speaker after it's already paired with your device.\"We appreciate collaborating with security researchers through our Vulnerability Rewards Program, which helps keep our users safe,\" a Google spokesperson wrote in a statement sent to Engadget. \"We worked with these researchers to fix these vulnerabilities, and we have not seen evidence of any exploitation outside of this report's lab setting. As a best security practice, we recommend users check their headphones for the latest firmware updates. We are constantly evaluating and enhancing Fast Pair and Find Hub security.\"The researchers created the video below to demonstrate how the flaw worksIn an email to Engadget, Google said the steps required to access the device’s microphone or audio are complex and involve multiple stages. The attackers would also need to remain within Bluetooth range. The company added that it provided its OEM partners with recommended fixes in September. Google also updated its Validator certification tool and its certification requirements.The researchers say that, in some cases, the risk applies even to those who don't use Android phones. For example, if the audio accessory has never been paired with a Google account, a hacker could use WhisperPair to not only pair with the audio device but also link it to their own Google account. They could then use Google's Find Hub tool to track the device's (and therefore your) location.Google said it rolled out a fix to its Find Hub network to address that particular scenario. However, the researchers told Wired that, within hours of the patch’s rollout, they found a workaround.The 17 affected devices are made by 10 different companies, all of which received Google Fast Pair certification. They include Sony, Jabra, JBL, Marshall, Xiaomi, Nothing, OnePlus, Soundcore, Logitech and Google. (Google says its affected Pixel Buds are already patched and protected.) The researchers posted a search tool that lets you see if your audio accessories are vulnerable.In a statement sent to Engadget, OnePlus said it's investigating the issue and \"will take appropriate action to protect our users' security and privacy.\" Marshall said it patched the issue in November and is working with Google to avoid similar issues in the future (see full statement below). We also contacted the other accessory makers and will update this story if we hear back.The researchers recommend updating your audio devices regularly. However, one of their concerns is that many people will never install the third-party manufacturer's app (required for updates), leaving their devices vulnerable.The full report from Wired has much more detail and is worth a read.Update, January 15 2026, 4:04PM ET: “We can confirm that Marshall has issued the necessary firmware updates and security patches to address the headphones potentially affected,” a company representative told Engadget. “These updates have been available since November and have been offered to all users since then. While this is an industry-wide issue, we take it seriously and are working closely with Google to reduce the risk of similar vulnerabilities in the future.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/flaw-in-17-google-fast-pair-audio-devices-could-let-hackers-eavesdrop-194613456.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Anthropic&#x27;s open source standard, the Model Context Protocol (MCP), released in late 2024, allows users to connect AI models and the agents atop them to external tools in a structured, reliable format. It is the engine behind Anthropic&#x27;s hit AI agentic programming harness, Claude Code, allowing it to access numerous functions like web browsing and file creation immediately when asked.But there was one problem: Claude Code typically had to \"read\" the instruction manual for every single tool available, regardless of whether it was needed for the immediate task, using up the available context that could otherwise be filled with more information from the user&#x27;s prompts or the agent&#x27;s responses.At least until last night. The Claude Code team released an update that fundamentally alters this equation. Dubbed MCP Tool Search, the feature introduces \"lazy loading\" for AI tools, allowing agents to dynamically fetch tool definitions only when necessary. It is a shift that moves AI agents from a brute-force architecture to something resembling modern software engineering—and according to early data, it effectively solves the \"bloat\" problem that was threatening to stifle the ecosystem.The &#x27;Startup Tax&#x27; on AgentsTo understand the significance of Tool Search, one must understand the friction of the previous system. The Model Context Protocol (MCP), released in 2024 by Anthropic as an open source standard was designed to be a universal standard for connecting AI models to data sources and tools—everything from GitHub repositories to local file systems.However, as the ecosystem grew, so did the \"startup tax.\"Thariq Shihipar, a member of the technical staff at Anthropic, highlighted the scale of the problem in the announcement.\"We&#x27;ve found that MCP servers may have up to 50+ tools,\" Shihipar wrote. \"Users were documenting setups with 7+ servers consuming 67k+ tokens.\"In practical terms, this meant a developer using a robust set of tools might sacrifice 33% or more of their available context window limit of 200,000 tokens before they even typed a single character of a prompt, as AI newsletter author Aakash Gupta pointed out in a post on X.The model was effectively \"reading\" hundreds of pages of technical documentation for tools it might never use during that session.Community analysis provided even starker examples. Gupta further noted that a single Docker MCP server could consume 125,000 tokens just to define its 135 tools.\"The old constraint forced a brutal tradeoff,\" he wrote. \"Either limit your MCP servers to 2-3 core tools, or accept that half your context budget disappears before you start working.\"How Tool Search WorksThe solution Anthropic rolled out — which Shihipar called \"one of our most-requested features on GitHub\" — is elegant in its restraint. Instead of preloading every definition, Claude Code now monitors context usage.According to the release notes, the system automatically detects when tool descriptions would consume more than 10% of the available context. When that threshold is crossed, the system switches strategies. Instead of dumping raw documentation into the prompt, it loads a lightweight search index.When the user asks for a specific action—say, \"deploy this container\"—Claude Code doesn&#x27;t scan a massive, pre-loaded list of 200 commands. Instead, it queries the index, finds the relevant tool definition, and pulls only that specific tool into the context.\"Tool Search flips the architecture,\" Gupta analyzed. \"The token savings are dramatic: from ~134k to ~5k in Anthropic’s internal testing. That’s an 85% reduction while maintaining full tool access.\"For developers maintaining MCP servers, this shifts the optimization strategy. Shihipar noted that the `server instructions` field in the MCP definition—previously a \"nice to have\"—is now critical. It acts as the metadata that helps Claude \"know when to search for your tools, similar to skills.\"&#x27;Lazy Loading&#x27; and Accuracy GainsWhile the token savings are the headline metric—saving money and memory is always popular—the secondary effect of this update might be more important: focus.LLMs are notoriously sensitive to \"distraction.\" When a model&#x27;s context window is stuffed with thousands of lines of irrelevant tool definitions, its ability to reason decreases. It creates a \"needle in a haystack\" problem where the model struggles to differentiate between similar commands, such as `notification-send-user` versus `notification-send-channel`.Boris Cherny, Head of Claude Code, emphasized this in his reaction to the launch on X: \"Every Claude Code user just got way more context, better instruction following, and the ability to plug in even more tools.\"The data backs this up. Internal benchmarks shared by the community indicate that enabling Tool Search improved the accuracy of the Opus 4 model on MCP evaluations from 49% to 74%. For the newer Opus 4.5, accuracy jumped from 79.5% to 88.1%.By removing the noise of hundreds of unused tools, the model can dedicate its \"attention\" mechanisms to the user&#x27;s actual query and the relevant active tools.Maturing the StackThis update signals a maturation in how we treat AI infrastructure. In the early days of any software paradigm, brute force is common. But as systems scale, efficiency becomes the primary engineering challenge.Aakash Gupta drew a parallel to the evolution of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like VSCode or JetBrains. \"The bottleneck wasn’t &#x27;too many tools.&#x27; It was loading tool definitions like 2020-era static imports instead of 2024-era lazy loading,\" he wrote. \"VSCode doesn’t load every extension at startup. JetBrains doesn’t inject every plugin’s docs into memory.\"By adopting \"lazy loading\"—a standard best practice in web and software development—Anthropic is acknowledging that AI agents are no longer just novelties; they are complex software platforms that require architectural discipline.Implications for the EcosystemFor the end user, this update is seamless: Claude Code simply feels \"smarter\" and retains more memory of the conversation. But for the developer ecosystem, it opens the floodgates.Previously, there was a \"soft cap\" on how capable an agent could be. Developers had to curate their toolsets carefully to avoid lobotomizing the model with excessive context. With Tool Search, that ceiling is effectively removed. An agent can theoretically have access to thousands of tools—database connectors, cloud deployment scripts, API wrappers, local file manipulators—without paying a penalty until those tools are actually touched.It turns the \"context economy\" from a scarcity model into an access model. As Gupta summarized, \"They’re not just optimizing context usage. They’re changing what ‘tool-rich agents’ can mean.\"The update is rolling out immediately for Claude Code users.

          "standfirst": "Agentic systems and enterprise search depend on strong data retrieval that works efficiently and accurately. Database provider MongoDB thinks its newest embeddings models help solve falling retrieval quality as more AI systems go into production.As agentic and RAG systems move into production, retrieval quality is emerging as a quiet failure point — one that can undermine accuracy, cost, and user trust even when models themselves perform well.The company launched four new versions of its embeddings and reranking models. Voyage 4 will be available in four modes: voyage-4 embedding, voyage-4-large, voyage-4-lite, and voyage-4-nano. MongoDB said the voyage-4 embedding serves as its general-purpose model; MongoDB considers Voyage-4-large its flagship model. Voyage-4-lite focuses on tasks requiring little latency and lower costs, and voyage-4-nano is intended for more local development and testing environments or for on-device data retrieval. Voyage-4-nano is also MongoDB’s first open-weight model. All models are available via an API and on MongoDB’s Atlas platform. The company said the models outperform similar models from Google and Cohere on the RTEB benchmark. Hugging Face’s RTEB benchmark puts Voyage 4 as the top embedding model. “Embedding models are one of those invisible choices that can really make or break AI experiences,” Frank Liu, product manager at MongoDB, said in a briefing. “You get them wrong, your search results will feel pretty random and shallow, but if you get them right, your application suddenly feels like it understands your users and your data.”He added that the goal of the Voyage 4 models is to improve the retrieval of real-world data, which often collapses once agentic and RAG pipelines go into production. MongoDB also released a new multimodal embedding model, voyage-multimodal-3.5, that can handle documents that include text, images, and video. This model vectorizes the data and extracts semantic meaning from the tables, graphics, figures, and slides typically found in enterprise documents.Enterprise’s embeddings problemsFor enterprises, an agentic system is only as good as its ability to reliably retrieve the right information at the right time. This requirement becomes harder as workloads scale and context windows fragment.Several model providers target that layer of agentic AI. Google’s Gemini Embedding model topped the embedding leaderboards, and Cohere launched its Embed 4 multimodal model, which processes documents more than 200 pages long. Mistral said its coding-embedding model, Codestral Embedding, outperforms Cohere, Google, and even MongoDB’s Voyage Code 3. MongoDB argues that benchmark performance alone doesn’t address the operational complexity enterprises face in production.MongoDB said many clients have found that their data stacks cannot handle context-aware, retrieval-intensive workloads in production. The company said it&#x27;s seeing more fragmentation with enterprises having to stitch together different solutions to connect databases with a retrieval or reranking model. To help customers who don’t want fragmented solutions, the company is offering its models through a single data platform, Atlas. MongoDB’s bet is that retrieval can’t be treated as a loose collection of best-of-breed components anymore. For enterprise agents to work reliably at scale, embeddings, reranking, and the data layer need to operate as a tightly integrated system rather than a stitched-together stack.",

          "standfirst": "During CES 2026, Samsung unveiled plenty of new TVs, monitors and other hardware. However, the company is also looking to expand further into video games and has announced a significant refresh to its Gaming Hub on smartphones. Engadget spoke with Samsung’s Jong Woo, VP of Game Services, who explained that the update will offer more personalized, faster ways to play and place greater emphasis on up-and-coming titles. Now available on Galaxy devices, with further updates planned, the new hub wants to be a more active space for the latest mobile games. \"We believe that gamers want to find new content that is personalized to them,\" said the VP of Samsung Games Services. He continued: \"We want to bring content to users and make it immediately available for them to play. We have instant plays where, through our cloud streaming technology, we can take Android-native games and put them in the cloud, so that when users want to try them, they don't have to go through the friction of downloading them first.” According to Samsung, the mobile Gaming Hub attracts over 160 million users across smartphones and other devices. However, the VP of Game Services at Samsung believes that, despite the vast library of games across many genres available to mobile users, \"mobile game discovery is broken.\" Samsung Initially, the mobile Gaming Hub was a supplemental app for all purchased games, allowing users to track their collection. With this update, all games purchased from both Google Play and the Galaxy Store are stored in the Gaming Hub. It's designed to be a single place for players to view their owned games, find recommendations, access cloud streaming for select games and even watch highlights from content creators. According to Woo, the larger goal of the new Samsung mobile Gaming Hub is to personalize and guide the mobile gaming experience for players, which has remained nebulous compared with gaming discovery experiences on PC and consoles. “We're getting a lot of feedback from the users, a lot of it from focus testing and beta testing, and what we're finding is that we believe we are solving pain points for mobile gamers,\" said Woo about rebuilding the Gaming Hub. \"We're getting an idea of gamer preferences at the individual, personalized level. Based on all of that, we're able to provide different types of recommendations.\" Another reason for the new changes to the Samsung Gaming Hub was to help foster a community for mobile gamers, including players and developers. In addition to sharing YouTube videos and content from gaming creators and streamers, the company plans to add more social elements to the Gaming Hub to make mobile gaming feel more active and less isolating. \"Mobile is a very personal experience, right? It's your personal device, and oftentimes when you play games on mobile, it feels like a solitary experience,” said Woo. Currently, the revamped Mobile Gaming Hub is only available for Galaxy smartphones and tablets. Users on non-Galaxy devices will still use the previous version of the Gaming Hub, for now. Compared with PC and console online hubs like Steam and PlayStation Network, it's clear that mobile platforms are still figuring out how to create an equally compelling space for engagement. Even with the vast user base, mobile game hubs tend to be a go-between for users to get to the products. There's more work to do, but the new Gaming Hub could be the first step in the right direction.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/samsung-refreshed-mobile-gaming-hub-150010632.html?src=rss",

The company said it's \"working on solutions to address\" that particular problem and will share more soon.Roblox shared the following statement from Matt Kaufman, the company’s Chief Safety Officer:“To suggest that our age check technology isn't working is a fundamental misunderstanding of what it takes to shift safety at scale. With a global community of over 150 million daily active users, we are pleased with where we are in the roll out process. It’s a process that will take time, you can’t flip a switch while building something that hasn’t existed before. Tens of millions of users have already completed the process, proving that the vast majority of our community values a safer, more age-appropriate environment. Expecting the system to be flawless overnight is ignoring the scale of this undertaking. We’ve already shared updates with our creator community to make this a smoother transition.

The platform's dev forum includes thousands of negative comments about the updates, with many of them wanting the entire update reversed.

Considering we're almost halfway though the season, the discount makes sense and is a good deal for anyone who wants to keep a close eye on the rest of the games to be played this year. The Standard plan includes commercials and support for only one device at a time, while the Premium tier offers no commercials, in-arena streams during breaks in the game, offline viewing of full games and concurrent streams on up to three devices at once. Last year, League Pass added multiview, which allows you to view up to four games at once on a single screen. This is included across both subscription tiers. The service also added a smart rewind tool that automatically selects key highlights and plays from each game. Outside the US and Canada, League Pass carries every single NBA game live, but within these countries a bevy of restrictions apply. In the US, any games being shown on your regional sports network will be blacked out as the service is meant for out-of-market games only. Also, any nationally broadcast games will not be available live, but instead will be available for on-demand viewing at 6AM ET the following day. The service is only for regular-season games.

          "title": "Valerion VisionMaster Max projector review: Near-perfect image quality comes at a price",
          "standfirst": "After a widely hyped and successful Kickstarter campaign, Valerion’s 4K VisionMaster Max laser projector has finally arrived. It’s the company’s new flagship model in the VisionMaster series, offering better image quality and more convenience than its other models. However, it’s quite expensive and has some stiff competition from Anker’s Nebula X1 and XGIMI’s Horizon 20 Max. I was eager to see how it compared to those models and if it delivers on Valerion’s promise of “pure cinema.” It does offer better image quality, but the difference isn’t quite enough to justify the big jump in price for most users. Features and design The VisionMaster Max has a classy squarish design with a glossy black finish up front and chrome fins on the side that house two 12W speakers. It’s smaller and fit my decor better than Nebula’s tall, plasticky X1, though to be fair the latter is also designed for outdoor use. The VisionMaster Max has a similar form factor to XGIMI’s Horizon 20 Max, but that model pivots on its stand, while the Valerion uses a kickstand-like support. For setup, the VisionMaster Max is quite flexible. It comes with a 0.9-1.5x optical zoom, so it can be installed between 7.8 and 13 feet away for a 120-inch screen size, which covers a wide range of scenarios. It also features a +/- 105 percent vertical shift option that helps you get an optically perfect screen fit without moving the projector or employing digital “keystone” adjustments that affect picture quality. If that still doesn’t work, you can swap out the included lens with a long-throw 0.9-2.0:1 option once it becomes available. The company has even promised an anamorphic lens for users with CinemaScope screens. Both of those items will be available for purchase separately with the prices yet to be disclosed. Steve Dent for Engadget For my space, I placed the VisionMaster Max on a table about 12 feet from my 120-inch screen and centered it horizontally as there’s no horizontal shift option (it can also be ceiling mounted, of course). Then, I went into the auto-alignment setting, made sure that the projected image was larger than my screen and hit “start alignment” to get a perfect fit to my screen. Though it lacks a motorized lens gimbal like the Nebula X1, the lens shift option provides the same flexibility, so setup was just as easy. For inputs, the VisionMaster Max comes with three HDMI 2.1 ports, including one with eARC for a sound bar, along with S/PDIF optical and 3.5mm audio outputs. Impressively, it includes a gigabit ethernet connection so you can either hardwire it to the internet or connect via Wi-Fi. The VisionMaster Max lacks liquid cooling like the Nebula X1, but Valerion claims a similar fan noise level of 28db. When I compared them side by side, it was only a touch louder than the X1 and not at all bothersome. Google TV is built in for streaming and projector control via the high-quality, partially backlit remote. It provides a large library of apps via Google Play along with a familiar interface. You get certified versions of Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video, Disney+, Max and others, plus Chromecast and AirPlay support, and Google Assistant for voice control. With 4GB of RAM and 128GB of ROM, the software felt a bit more responsive than Google TV on the Nebula X1. Image quality Steve Dent for Engadget The VisionMaster Max has a number of features designed to optimize image quality. It’s one of the few consumer projectors with a dynamic iris and a feature called Enhanced Black Level (EBL) for improved contrast. It uses an RGB triple-laser light source (rated for 25,000 hours) paired with a 0.47-inch DLP chip that projects 1080p natively or 4K video via pixel shifting. This same chip is used on almost every consumer-level 4K projector, but XGIMI’s upcoming Titan Noir Max projector will pack a much larger 0.78-inch DMD chip that should deliver a sharper picture. The VisionMaster Max also supports every HDR format, including Dolby Vision and Samsung’s HDR10+, along with Valerion’s own tone-mapping HDR setting. You can choose from seven picture modes for SDR, eight for HDR, three for Dolby Vision and four for HDR10+. The projector handled most HDR content well, though it occasionally lost detail in extra-bright shots. However, that can largely be fixed using the extensive manual color controls. With all those features, the VisionMaster Max can output 4K 60 fps video at up to 3,500 ANSI lumens with a 50,000:1 contrast ratio, easily besting its main rivals. On top of that, it promises an impressive 110 percent of the Rec.2020 HDR color spectrum, with a delta E (color accuracy) value of less than 0.8 straight out of the box (any delta E less than 2 is undetectable by the human eye). Another key feature is reduction of the rainbow effect that can occur with DLP projectors. After some fine-tuning that’s typically required with new projectors, I was highly impressed with the image quality. Brightness was high enough in “standard” mode to watch content like sports or TV shows without lowering the blinds, and can be increased if you don’t mind compromising color accuracy. When used in ideal conditions like a darkened room, the VisionMaster Max’s image quality is the best of any projector I’ve tested to date. In Filmmaker mode (with the EBL setting enabled), contrast levels are outstanding, with true blacks showing in dark-lit scenes instead of the washed-out greys seen on most projectors. However, I kept the EBL mode at the minimum setting as I noticed it caused some color shifting at the other levels. Dynamic iris projectors can cause excessive “pumping” or sudden changes in light levels, but after adjusting the iris to a medium setting, I saw no signs of that. The famously dark Game of Thrones Night King battle scene was easy to see on the VisionMaster Max. Steve Dent for Engadget Color accuracy is outstanding straight out of the box both in HDR and non-HDR modes, particularly, again in Filmmaker mode. Visually, I couldn’t detect any anomalies when looking at color bars or other charts, though my Calibrite Color Checker told me that the gamut of hues was slightly less than what Valerion claims (under 100 percent of BT.2020). Still, the Max’s high color accuracy allowed me to see TV series and movies exactly as the filmmakers intended for a range of HDR and non-HDR movies including White Lotus season 3, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Andor and Dune 2. The projector’s excellent dynamic range and contrast revealed shadow details in Game of Thrones’ Night King battle, which has famously dark scenes that are difficult to see on some TVs. I have a slight amount of sensitivity to the “rainbow” effect, but the RBE Reduction feature effectively eliminated that visual artifact for me. However, it also introduced a slight amount of noise, so I disabled it. The feature might be a godsend for some users who are particularly susceptible, but it still needs a bit more refinement. Audio and gaming Of all the luxury projectors I’ve tested to date, the VisionMaster Max is the best for gaming — even compared to some dedicated models. It delivers latency as low as 4ms and a refresh rate up to 240Hz at 1080p, and 15ms for 4K at 60Hz. I tested a couple of PC titles including Cyberpunk 2077 and Hollow Knight: Silksong and found them to be as responsive as I’ve seen on any TV, but with far more immersion thanks to the huge, bright and color-accurate image. Steve Dent for Engadget You can output audio via the S/PDIF optical output, 3.5mm headphone jack, HDMI 2.1 ports and even USB 3.0 Type A ports. The built-in 12W stereo speakers work well and are fairly loud, so you can use them in a pinch. However, since it supports both DTS:X and Dolby Atmos, you’ll ideally want to connect it to a nice home theater audio system with support for at least 5.1 surround sound. In comparison, the Nebula X1 doesn’t have Dolby Atmos support, but it does give you the option to purchase and easily connect stereo Bluetooth speakers at a relatively cheap price. For around the same cost as the Valerion Max, Anker is also offering the Nebula X1 Pro that comes with a giant outdoor sound system and does support Dolby Atmos. Wrap-up The Valerion VisionMaster Max is a highly capable indoor projector that offers the best image quality I’ve seen thanks to the dynamic iris and Enhanced Black Level features. However, it’s also a lot more expensive than rival models at $5,000. It’s pretty hard to justify that extra money, unless you’re really fussy about picture accuracy and gaming performance, or need other features like the 1Gbps ethernet port. Most buyers would be better off spending a lot less on Valerion’s own $2,699 VisionMaster Pro2, Anker’s $2,999 Nebula X1 or the $2,999 XGIMI Horizon 20 Max. Again, the difference in picture quality is too slight to justify the huge price jump to the VisionMaster Max. You might also want to wait to see how much XGIMI’s incoming Titan Noir Max 4K costs, as it also offers a dynamic iris but has a much bigger DLP chip.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/valerion-visionmaster-max-projector-review-near-perfect-image-quality-comes-at-a-price-140045939.html?src=rss",
          "content": "After a widely hyped and successful Kickstarter campaign, Valerion’s 4K VisionMaster Max laser projector has finally arrived. It’s the company’s new flagship model in the VisionMaster series, offering better image quality and more convenience than its other models. However, it’s quite expensive and has some stiff competition from Anker’s Nebula X1 and XGIMI’s Horizon 20 Max. I was eager to see how it compared to those models and if it delivers on Valerion’s promise of “pure cinema.” It does offer better image quality, but the difference isn’t quite enough to justify the big jump in price for most users. Features and design The VisionMaster Max has a classy squarish design with a glossy black finish up front and chrome fins on the side that house two 12W speakers. It’s smaller and fit my decor better than Nebula’s tall, plasticky X1, though to be fair the latter is also designed for outdoor use. The VisionMaster Max has a similar form factor to XGIMI’s Horizon 20 Max, but that model pivots on its stand, while the Valerion uses a kickstand-like support. For setup, the VisionMaster Max is quite flexible. It comes with a 0.9-1.5x optical zoom, so it can be installed between 7.8 and 13 feet away for a 120-inch screen size, which covers a wide range of scenarios. It also features a +/- 105 percent vertical shift option that helps you get an optically perfect screen fit without moving the projector or employing digital “keystone” adjustments that affect picture quality. If that still doesn’t work, you can swap out the included lens with a long-throw 0.9-2.0:1 option once it becomes available. The company has even promised an anamorphic lens for users with CinemaScope screens. Both of those items will be available for purchase separately with the prices yet to be disclosed. Steve Dent for Engadget For my space, I placed the VisionMaster Max on a table about 12 feet from my 120-inch screen and centered it horizontally as there’s no horizontal shift option (it can also be ceiling mounted, of course). Then, I went into the auto-alignment setting, made sure that the projected image was larger than my screen and hit “start alignment” to get a perfect fit to my screen. Though it lacks a motorized lens gimbal like the Nebula X1, the lens shift option provides the same flexibility, so setup was just as easy. For inputs, the VisionMaster Max comes with three HDMI 2.1 ports, including one with eARC for a sound bar, along with S/PDIF optical and 3.5mm audio outputs. Impressively, it includes a gigabit ethernet connection so you can either hardwire it to the internet or connect via Wi-Fi. The VisionMaster Max lacks liquid cooling like the Nebula X1, but Valerion claims a similar fan noise level of 28db. When I compared them side by side, it was only a touch louder than the X1 and not at all bothersome. Google TV is built in for streaming and projector control via the high-quality, partially backlit remote. It provides a large library of apps via Google Play along with a familiar interface. You get certified versions of Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video, Disney+, Max and others, plus Chromecast and AirPlay support, and Google Assistant for voice control. With 4GB of RAM and 128GB of ROM, the software felt a bit more responsive than Google TV on the Nebula X1. Image quality Steve Dent for Engadget The VisionMaster Max has a number of features designed to optimize image quality. It’s one of the few consumer projectors with a dynamic iris and a feature called Enhanced Black Level (EBL) for improved contrast. It uses an RGB triple-laser light source (rated for 25,000 hours) paired with a 0.47-inch DLP chip that projects 1080p natively or 4K video via pixel shifting. This same chip is used on almost every consumer-level 4K projector, but XGIMI’s upcoming Titan Noir Max projector will pack a much larger 0.78-inch DMD chip that should deliver a sharper picture. The VisionMaster Max also supports every HDR format, including Dolby Vision and Samsung’s HDR10+, along with Valerion’s own tone-mapping HDR setting. You can choose from seven picture modes for SDR, eight for HDR, three for Dolby Vision and four for HDR10+. The projector handled most HDR content well, though it occasionally lost detail in extra-bright shots. However, that can largely be fixed using the extensive manual color controls. With all those features, the VisionMaster Max can output 4K 60 fps video at up to 3,500 ANSI lumens with a 50,000:1 contrast ratio, easily besting its main rivals. On top of that, it promises an impressive 110 percent of the Rec.2020 HDR color spectrum, with a delta E (color accuracy) value of less than 0.8 straight out of the box (any delta E less than 2 is undetectable by the human eye).

Riding atop one of NASA's diesel-powered crawler transporters, the Space Launch System rocket and its mobile launch platform will exit the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center around 7:00 am EST (11:00 UTC). The massive tracked transporter, certified by Guinness as the world's heaviest self-propelled vehicle, is expected to cover the four miles between the assembly building and Launch Complex 39B in about eight to 10 hours. The rollout marks a major step for NASA's Artemis II mission, the first human voyage to the vicinity of the Moon since the last Apollo lunar landing in December 1972. Artemis II will not land. Instead, a crew of four astronauts will travel around the far side of the Moon at a distance of several thousand miles, setting the record for the farthest humans have ever ventured from Earth.Read full article Comments",

Archaeologists discovered the shipwreck while surveying the seabed in preparation for a construction project for the city of Copenhagen, Denmark. It lay on its side, half-buried in the sand, 12 meters below the choppy surface of the Øresund, the straight that runs between Denmark and Sweden. By comparing the tree rings in the wreck’s wooden planks and timbers with rings from other, precisely dated tree samples, the archaeologists concluded that the ship had been built around 1410 CE. The Skaelget 2 shipwreck, with a diver for scale. Credit: Viking Ship Museum A medieval megaship Svaelget 2, as archaeologists dubbed the wreck (its original name is long since lost to history), was a type of merchant ship called a cog: a wide, flat-bottomed, high-sided ship with an open cargo hold and a square sail on a single mast. A bigger, heavier, more advanced version of the Viking knarrs of centuries past, the cog was the high-tech supertanker of its day. It was built to carry bulky commodities from ports in the Netherlands, north around the coast of Denmark, and then south through the Øresund to trading ports on the Baltic Sea—but this one didn’t quite make it.Read full article Comments",

His doctors eventually determined that a dreaded hypervirulent bacteria—which is rising globally—was ravaging several of his organs, including his brain. According to the man, the problems started three weeks before his hospital visit, when he said he ate some bad meat and started vomiting and having diarrhea. Those symptoms faded after about two weeks, but then new problems began—he started coughing and having chills and a fever. His cough only worsened from there. At the hospital, doctors took X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans of his chest and abdomen. The images revealed over 15 nodules and masses in his lungs. But that's not all they found. The imaging also revealed a mass in his liver that was 8.6 cm in diameter (about 3.4 inches). Lab work pointed toward an infection, so doctors admitted him to the hospital and provided oxygen to help with his breathing, as well as antibiotics. But his chills and cough continued.Read full article Comments",

The database comes in the form of a rainbow table, which is a precomputed table of hash values linked to their corresponding plaintext. These generic tables, which work against multiple hashing schemes, allow hackers to take over accounts by quickly mapping a stolen hash to its password counterpart. NTLMv1 rainbow tables are particularly easy to construct because of NTLMv1’s limited keyspace, meaning the relatively small number of possible passwords the hashing function allows for. NTLMv1 rainbow tables have existed for two decades but typically require large amounts of resources to make any use of them. New ammo for security pros On Thursday, Mandiant said it had released an NTLMv1 rainbow table that will allow defenders and researchers (and, of course, malicious hackers, too) to recover passwords in under 12 hours using consumer hardware costing less than $600 USD. The table is hosted in Google Cloud. The database works against Net-NTLMv1 passwords, which are used in network authentication for accessing resources such as SMB network sharing.Read full article Comments",

TSMC manufactures chips for companies including Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and Qualcomm, making it a linchpin of the global electronics supply chain. The company produces the vast majority of the world's most advanced semiconductors, and its factories in Taiwan have become a focal point of US-China tensions over technology and trade. When TSMC reports strong demand and ramps up spending, it signals that the companies designing AI chips expect years of continued growth. \"All in all, I believe in my point of view, the AI is real—not only real, it's starting to grow into our daily life. And we believe that is kind of—we call it AI megatrend, we certainly would believe that,\" Wei said during the call. \"So another question is 'can the semiconductor industry be good for three, four, five years in a row?'

Key among the new details is that the cyber operation was able to turn off electricity for most residents in the capital city of Caracas for only a few minutes, though in some neighborhoods close to the military base where Maduro was seized, the outage lasted for three days. The cyber-op also targeted Venezuelan military radar defenses. The paper said the US Cyber Command was involved. Got more details? “Turning off the power in Caracas and interfering with radar allowed US military helicopters to move into the country undetected on their mission to capture Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan president who has now been brought to the United States to face drug charges,” the NYT reported.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "It has been nearly 80 years since Ferrari unleashed its first V12-powered sports car upon the world with the 125 S. In 1947, its debut year, the 125 S secured Ferrari’s first race victory, along with five other wins in the 14 events it competed in that season. Although it was soon replaced by the 159 S, the success of the 125 S kick-started Ferrari’s storied history of producing some of the most desirable 12-cylinder performance cars known to man. And while the Italian automaker has come to embrace forced induction and electrification in recent years, its legacy of building stunning front-engine, rear-wheel drive machines with spectacular V12s stuffed into their engine bays continues with the 12Cilindri Spider. Ferrari hasn’t shied away from leveraging cutting-edge technology in the development of its latest models, but the company also understands the value of a good throwback. As the successor to the 812 Superfast, the 12Cilindri boasts clever performance technologies, like a sophisticated active aero system and a four-wheel steering system that can manage each corner independently to enhance response, but it’s ultimately an homage to the heady days of late '60s luxury grand touring. The exterior styling takes obvious inspiration from the 365 GTB Daytona, while its lack of all-wheel drive, turbocharging, and electric assistance bucks trends that have become nearly inescapable in modern performance cars.Read full article Comments",

This time it was about FSD (again), which has been the subject of more than 60 complaints to the regulator after Teslas operating under FSD either ignored red traffic lights or crossed into oncoming traffic. As part of the preliminary investigation, NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation has asked Tesla for more information on the problem. This week, it told the automaker it could have a five-week extension on its homework. To be fair to Tesla, NHTSA has asked for a comprehensive amount of information: a list of every Tesla produced and sold or leased in the United States, including whether or not that car had FSD and which version; cumulative data on how many US Teslas have FSD and how often it's used; and a list of all the customer complaints, field reports, incident reports, lawsuits, and other data related to FSD ignoring traffic laws. For each incident involving a crash, Tesla must give NHTSA a summary of the incident, including \"causal and contributing factors.\" Further questions require information on FSD use by crashed cars; any alert shown to the drivers; what work, simulation, or otherwise Tesla has conducted to ameliorate the problem; any modifications or changes to FSD hardware or software; an explanation of Tesla's theory of operation for traffic lights and stop signs; and Tesla's assessment of the problem.Read full article Comments",

A significant portion of the 440 new satellites ordered by Eutelsat from Airbus to renew or expand its OneWeb constellation will be launched into orbit by the new Maia rocket.

          "content": "This post contains some mild spoilers, mostly from the beginning of the first episode. Today is a good day to watch television. That's because the first two episodes of Star Trek: Starfleet Academy hit the Paramount+ streaming service, becoming the newest addition to the long-running Star Trek franchise. It's set in the late 32nd century, 120 years after the burn that ended all warp travel, and with it, most of Starfleet in the process. Now that warp travel is once again possible—you'll have to watch Discovery's final three seasons for more on that—the Federation is putting itself back together, and that includes reopening Starfleet Academy. That means this show is about young people in space, like Caleb Mir (Sandro Rosta), who was separated from his mother by Starfleet as a child, 15 years earlier. Mir and his mother, played by Tatiana Maslany, were traveling with a pirate—Nus Braka, played by a scenery-chewing Paul Giamatti—who killed a Federation officer while stealing food for them. The first episode opens on Braka and the Mirs being apprehended by Starfleet. Despite her misgivings, Captain Nahla Ake (Holly Hunter) carries out her order to separate mother and child. She's to go to a rehabilitation colony, he's to become a ward of the Federation and go to school on Bajor. At least that's the plan until he escapes a few minutes later. Then we jump forward 15 years. Ake is teaching on Bajor, having retired from the Federation, ashamed of what she'd done. Admiral Vance (Oded Fehr) shows up and asks her to become commandant at the newly reopened academy in San Francisco; for the past few decades, new recruits have been trained instead by the War College. But Starfleet needs explorers now, and having a rival school means they can show up at some point to challenge some of the show's protagonists to a Parrises Squares tournament.Read full article Comments",
