The largely successful mission for the world's largest rocket was an important milestone for SpaceX's Starship program after months of repeated setbacks, including three disappointing test flights and a powerful explosion on the ground that destroyed the ship that engineers were originally readying for this launch. For the first time, SpaceX engineers received data on the performance of the ship's upgraded heat shield and control flaps during reentry back into the atmosphere. The three failed Starship test flights to start the year ended before the ship reached reentry. Elon Musk, SpaceX's founder and CEO, has described developing a durable, reliable heat shield as the most pressing challenge for making Starship a fully and rapidly reusable rocket.Read full article Comments",

But one of the field's former giants is shutting down—and taking all of those old posts with it.

That gives current and former users just over a month to export anything they want to save. TypePad had previously removed the ability to create new accounts at some point in 2020.

While there were plenty of species present in the Cretaceous, they're thought to have origins that trace back to the Jurassic. It has been hard to say much about those origins, however, because the fossil evidence was so sparse. One of the earliest potential ankylosaur species, Spicomellus, was known from only a single partial rib; others are known only by jaw fragments or teeth. Now, however, we have a much better picture of what Spicomellus afer looks like thanks to a much larger collection of bones discovered in Morocco. It turns out that the heavy armor and rows of chunky spikes found on Cretaceous ankylosaurs were actually subdued compared to the massive rows of meter-long spikes and bony collars found on Spicomellus. It looks like what would happen if you combined the aesthetics of punk with the flamboyance of glam and made a dinosaur out of the results. A spiky find Cretaceous ankylosaurs share a number of common features. One is a short, broad body form that kept the herbivores close to the ground when on all four limbs. Another common feature: bony plates, formed from the skin, that provided the animal with the equivalent of body armor. Some of these, especially along the animal's ribs, thickened into short, blunt spikes that provided added protection. Finally, many species had tails that ended in club-like growths that attached to the vertebrae in the tail through features with the highly technical name of \"handles.\"Read full article Comments",

And as the automaker transitions into model year 2026, it's giving the Macan some new digital toys. Now, both Android and iPhone users will be able to create a digital key for the car (iPhone users can also add a key to their Apple Watch). This works via near-field communication as well as Bluetooth low energy and ultra-wideband, and you can share keys with up to seven other users from your phone's wallet. You can also use your phone to open the trunk (although operating the frunk requires the My Porsche App). The key should work even if the phone needs charging. For Macans fitted with 360-degree parking cameras, several new features leverage the sensors. There's a transparent hood function that shows you on the infotainment screen whatever it is that's being obscured by the front of the vehicle, which should be useful should you take the Macan off-road.Read full article Comments",

No such promise exists. But she trusted what the AI \"knows\" more than the postal worker—as if she'd consulted an oracle rather than a statistical text generator accommodating her wishes. This scene reveals a fundamental misunderstanding about AI chatbots. There is nothing inherently special, authoritative, or accurate about AI-generated outputs. Given a reasonably trained AI model, the accuracy of any large language model (LLM) response depends on how you guide the conversation. They are prediction machines that will produce whatever pattern best fits your question, regardless of whether that output corresponds to reality. Despite these issues, millions of daily users engage with AI chatbots as if they were talking to a consistent person—confiding secrets, seeking advice, and attributing fixed beliefs to what is actually a fluid idea-connection machine with no persistent self. This personhood illusion isn't just philosophically troublesome—it can actively harm vulnerable individuals while obscuring a sense of accountability when a company's chatbot \"goes off the rails.\"Read full article Comments",

The post states: Susan Monarez is no longer director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We thank her for her dedicated service to the American people. @SecKennedy has full confidence in his team at @CDCgov who will continue to be vigilant in protecting Americans against infectious diseases at home and abroad. The department did not address the circumstances surrounding Monarez's ouster. But The Washington Post reported this evening that US Health Secretary and fervent anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had pressed Monarez for days on her willingness to rescind approvals for COVID-19 vaccines. Monarez reportedly met with Kennedy and other officials Monday and declined to agree to changes without consulting vaccine advisors.

On Tuesday, Anthropic announced the launch of Claude for Chrome, a web browser-based AI agent that can take actions on behalf of users. Due to security concerns, the extension is only rolling out as a research preview to 1,000 subscribers on Anthropic's Max plan, which costs between $100 and $200 per month, with a waitlist available for other users. The Claude for Chrome extension allows users to chat with the Claude AI model in a sidebar window that maintains the context of everything happening in their browser.

More adventurous users can attach the screen onto their desktop PC's fan mounts or side panel. I used Corsair's monitor for a couple of weeks.

          "content": "The single-player Star Citizen spin-off Squadron 42 is slated to finally be in players' hands in 2026, 11 full years after its initial 2015 release target. And after all that time, Cloud Imperium Games CEO Chris Roberts says he's hopeful that the title will be received similarly to another 2026 release that happens to be possibly the most anticipated video game of all time: Grand Theft Auto VI. A recent report from French Canadian outlet La Presse (translated) suggests that Squadron 42's launch is being timed so that it \"won't be overshadowed\" by the planned May launch of Grand Theft Auto VI. \"We're hoping it'll be almost as big an event,\" Roberts said in comparing the two upcoming releases in an interview with the French paper. \"Other than GTA VI, it's probably the biggest-budget AAA game [of the year].\" That's a pretty bold claim, considering Squadron 42's very public and tumultuous path to a purported \"feature complete\" status in 2023. But it seems at least somewhat reasonable when you consider that GTA VI's development budget of nearly $1 billion lines up closely with $859 million in crowdfunding currently being reported for Star Citizen as a whole.Read full article Comments",

These stars formed new chemical elements, which enriched the universe and allowed the next generations of stars to form the first planets. The first stars were initially composed of pure hydrogen and helium, and they were massive—hundreds to thousands of times the mass of the Sun and millions of times more luminous. Their short lives ended in enormous explosions called supernovae, so they had neither the time nor the raw materials to form planets, and they should no longer exist for astronomers to observe. At least that’s what we thought.Read full article Comments",

Bless Volkswagen for keeping the helical gears turning, both literally and figuratively. The 2025 Jetta GLI, Volkswagen's sporty sedan, still offers a gear lever with actual gears attached at the other end, and a third pedal hanging down from under the dash. Meanwhile, Golf GTI fans are still sobbing in their beer because 2024 was the last model year you could row your own in the hot hatch—now it's paddles only. Volkswagen updated the 2025 Jetta GLI with a new grille, LED headlights, and light bars that connect across both the front grille and rear taillights. There's a red accent stripe that runs across the lower front fascia and turns up at the front corners, somewhat like The Joker's lipstick, but way less menacing. It's less distinctive than the Golf GTI, though, and the design even reminds me of the 2017-era Honda Accord a bit. So, yes, in a face-off, the Golf GTI wins. The test GLI's wheels get black paint with the Black Package (blackened wheels and side mirror caps). The Monument Gray color option pairs with a black roof, which must seem like a good idea to people who don't live in the Southwest, where cars overheat before they're even started.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Marine biologist and conservationist David Shiffman was an early power user and evangelist for science engagement on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. Over the years, he trained more than 2,000 early career scientists on how to best use the platform for professional goals: networking with colleagues, sharing new scientific papers, and communicating with interested members of the public. But when Elon Musk bought Twitter in 2022, renaming it X, changes to both the platform's algorithm and moderation policy soured Shiffman on the social media site. He started looking for a viable alternative among the fledgling platforms that had begun to pop up: most notably Threads, Post, Mastodon, and Bluesky. He was among the first wave of scientists to join Bluesky and found that, even in its infancy, it had many of the features he had valued in \"golden age\" Twitter. Shiffman also noticed that he wasn't the only one in the scientific community having issues with Twitter. This impression was further bolstered by news stories in outlets like Nature, Science, and the Chronicle of Higher Education noting growing complaints about Twitter and increased migration over to Bluesky by science professionals. (Full disclosure: I joined Bluesky around the same time as Shiffman, for similar reasons: Twitter had ceased to be professionally useful, and many of the science types I'd been following were moving to Bluesky. I nuked my Twitter account in November 2024.)Read full article Comments",
