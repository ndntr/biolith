Black Friday deals to shop now Apple AirPods 4 for $90 (30 percent off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous.

Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Lego Disney advent calendar 2025 43253 for $31 (31 percent off): I probably don't need to tell you 'tis the season for advent calendars. Lego has a bunch, and this one in particular is on a good deal right now. Like most Lego advent calendars, this one includes a number of bricks and minifigs that, when put together, make a coherent, themed scene. Google TV Streamer 4K for $75 ($25 off): Our top pick for the best streaming device right now, the latest version of Google's streamer supports 4K video and an excellent, easy-to-use interface that will feel familiar to anyone who's seen a set with the Google TV technology built in. It provides access to all of the major streaming services including Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, YouTube and more, plus it has a handy on-screen pop up that lets you control all compatible smart home devices right from your TV. Also available at Walmart. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $499 ($100 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple iPad mini for $399 ($100 off): Apple's smallest tablet, the iPad mini is the best option for those who prefer their tablet be roughly the size of a paperback book. The latest model runs on the A17 Pro chipset and has an upgraded 128GB of storage in the base configuration. It also supports the Apple Pencil Pro. Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds.

There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $199 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. Also available at Best Buy. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $500 (50 percent off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. If a cordless stick vacuum is what you're looking for, don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals. EcoFlow Black Friday deals — get up to 80 percent off: Portable power stations are an investment, but they can be crucial pieces of tech during emergencies.

          "standfirst": "Apple has continued its trend of giving users more creative freedom over how their iPhones look and feel, and one of the most striking new customization options in iOS 26 is the ability to stretch the clock on your lock screen. The feature, part of Apple’s refreshed design language for iPhone software, allows the time to expand across more of the screen, giving it a bold, modern appearance. Whether you prefer the minimalist look of small numerals or the dramatic impact of an oversized clock, iOS 26 makes it easy to adjust your lock screen style to suit your taste. This new resizing option is officially referred to as “adaptive time,” and it transforms what used to be a static lock-screen element into something that feels more fluid and responsive. By dragging a simple on-screen handle, you can expand or shrink the size of the time display, creating a distinctive visual effect that gives your lock screen a fresh new personality. How to stretch your lock-screen clock To access the stretch option, start by waking your iPhone and remaining on the lock screen. Instead of unlocking the device, press and hold anywhere on the display to enter customization mode. This brings up a carousel of your saved lock screens, allowing you to edit the one that’s currently active. Tap “Customize,” then choose the “Lock Screen” option to enter the editor. Once the editing screen appears, tap directly on the clock. This will bring up the familiar font and color panel introduced in earlier versions of iOS. To make the stretch feature available, the first font option (the default and leftmost style) must be selected. It should also be set to use the Arabic Western script. After confirming these settings, tap the clock again to close the font panel. If the wallpaper supports the feature, a small circular drag handle will appear in the lower-right corner of the clock. Touch and hold this handle, then drag it downward to stretch the clock. The digits will expand in real time as you move your finger. When you’re happy with the size, release the handle. To save your changes, tap “Done” in the top-right corner of the screen. Exiting customization mode will reveal your new, enlarged clock on the lock screen. If the stretch feature doesn’t appear, the issue is usually related to the font or wallpaper. Some wallpapers, particularly those with subjects that fill the upper portion of the frame, limit how much the clock can expand. If the image leaves little open space, iOS hides the handle to prevent the time from overlapping key parts of the photo. Switching to a simpler or more spacious wallpaper usually resolves this. Understanding the stretched clock feature In previous versions of iOS, the lock-screen clock was fixed in place. Regardless of the wallpaper used, its size and position remained the same. iOS 26 changes that by introducing a resize handle that appears on the bottom-right corner of the clock once the screen is in edit mode. When this handle is dragged downward, the digits expand, allowing the time to stretch dramatically toward the center of the screen. The feature works in both directions, meaning the clock can also be shrunk back to its previous size if the stretched look is too much for you. The stretched clock effect works best with the new Liquid Glass interface design Apple introduced in iOS 26. This approach blends the clock’s font with the background, creating a subtle depth effect where the time appears to hover over the wallpaper. However, the resizing tool is not available on every setup. It only works when specific conditions are met, including the use of the default clock font and the standard Arabic Western script. If any other font or script is selected, the stretch handle will not appear. Cherlynn Low for Engadget Troubleshooting and limitations The stretch function in iOS 26 is a visual adjustment, not a full-scale redesign of the lock screen, and there are a few limitations to be aware of. It works only with the default clock font, and changing the typeface or script will remove the resize option entirely. Users who rely on different numeral styles or custom fonts won’t see the handle appear. Similarly, widgets can interfere with resizing if they occupy too much space beneath the clock. Removing them temporarily can make it easier to adjust the clock size. Some users have reported that the stretch handle disappears after software updates or when certain Focus modes are active. However, restarting your iPhone or disabling those modes typically restores it. As this is a relatively new feature, Apple may still be refining how it behaves across different iPhone models and lock-screen setups. The visual impact of the stretched clock depends largely on your wallpaper. Minimal backgrounds with clean space at the top allow the time to expand without cluttering the screen. Complex or busy images tend to reduce the effect, as the clock will automatically adjust its transparency and positioning to stay readable. The stretched design looks particularly polished on wallpapers that match Apple’s new Liquid Glass aesthetic, where colors subtly blend through the numerals for a semi-transparent glow. Making the most of your stretched clock While the stretch feature is primarily cosmetic, it contributes to the broader trend of personalization across iOS. Apple’s lock-screen customization tools now include options for widgets, depth-aware wallpapers, color filters and dynamic animations, giving users more control than ever over their device’s appearance. The stretched clock fits naturally into this toolkit, offering an easy way to change the entire mood of your lock screen in seconds. For users who prefer a bold, modern design, the larger clock size provides immediate impact and better visibility. Those who favor a more minimalist layout can keep it subtle by dragging the handle upward to restore the smaller, classic look. Whatever your preference, the process is reversible and quick, meaning you can experiment freely without losing your original layout. Apple’s focus with iOS 26 is clearly on personalization and polish. The stretched clock may seem like a small detail, but it captures the overall philosophy behind this update, blending design flexibility with simple, intuitive gestures. With just a few taps and a short drag, your iPhone’s lock screen can transform into something uniquely yours, whether that’s a subtle enhancement or a bold statement across the display.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-stretch-the-clock-on-your-lock-screen-in-ios-26-130032926.html?src=rss",

I'm here to tell you, though, that cybersecurity doesn't have to be complex, difficult or time-consuming. You don't need to be a hacker to foil a hacker — you only have to take advantage of simple tips and free apps designed to make you safer online. Whether you commit to all 12 detailed here or only focus on one, you'll be much more secure for it. 1. Install security updates immediately One of the most important things you can do to ensure your digital security is to install all software updates as soon as they become available on your devices. When you see the notification, don't wait — train yourself to download the update immediately. Not all software updates are about security, but the ones that are form your best line of defense against technical hacks. When developers discover a flaw that can be exploited, they ship an update to fix it. By the time the flaw gets patched, chances are very high that hackers also know about it, so any time lost means you could be the next to get exploited. As you go down this list, you'll learn that cybersecurity threats are less technical than you think. To counter the ones that are, however, there's nothing more important you can do than install security updates. 2. Use strong passwords Weak, easily guessed passwords are one of the most frequent causes of data breaches and malware attacks. If a password is one of the ten or so most common, an attacker may be able to guess it with no other information. If it's connected to you — your birthday, say, or mother's maiden name — it may be guessable from information anyone can look up online. Even if your password is a random string of characters, it might still be guessable if it's too short. Hackers can use programs to guess all possible combinations and try each one on a target account. The longer a password is, the more exponentially difficult it is to guess. SEAN GLADWELL via Getty Images That means you need passwords that are both long and meaningless to you. You might rightly complain that these are bastards to remember, but you're in luck: password managers can do that for you. A password manager app or browser extension can create passwords when you need them, store them securely and fill them in automatically. All you have to remember is the one master password that unlocks all the others. 3. Set up two-factor authentication Even the strongest password might get revealed through no fault of your own, like if it's stored without encryption and leaked in a data breach. That's why it helps to have two-factor authentication (2FA), also known as multi-factor authentication (MFA), as a second secure layer on every account. You probably already know 2FA as the irritating extra step that makes you go get your phone — but that's not the only way to do it. Many apps, including Google and Apple, now let you log in through passkeys. These not only don't require you to enter a code or password, but use asymmetric encryption, sharing credentials between your device and the service that runs the passkeys. It's a lot quicker for you, and leaves nothing to steal. 4. Back everything up Ransomware and its cousins are a growth industry within the cybercrime economy. These attacks corrupt your files or lock you out of them until you pay a fee to get them back. The easiest way to foil a ransomware attack, or to clear any other kind of malware off a device, is to restore the entire system from the most recent backup. To make sure you actually have a backup, experts recommend the 3-2-1 rule: three different backups, on two different types of storage, with at least one physically distant from the main system. For example, you could have one backup on another device in your house, one in the cloud and one on a portable hard drive. Automatic backup services can save disk images for you at set intervals so you don't have to remember to do it yourself. 5. Learn to spot social engineering Despite all the technobabble flying around the cybersecurity world, a great many scams and hacks are accomplished through methods a 19th-century con artist would recognize. Scammers pose as experts or authority figures to gain your trust, and use frightening language to bypass your critical thinking. Ticking clocks, emotional manipulation and fake identities are all in the toolbox. Alex Cristi via Getty Images Take phishing, in which hackers trick you into giving up your information willingly. A typical phishing email might pose as a bank, credit bureau or other authoritative service. In red letters, it may demand your bank password or social security number to immediately fix an irregularity with your account. Other common approaches include warning you about speeding tickets you never incurred or sending receipts for subscriptions you never bought. Social engineering attacks are constantly evolving, but they often fall back on the same strategies. The best way to foil them is to take a deep breath every time you receive a frightening email or text message, then research it in detail: look up the email address, check the visual design to make sure the sender is who they claim to be, and ask yourself if there's any way the message could be true. I highly recommend working through this phishing quiz — it's tough, but fair, and extremely educational. 6. Always check links before clicking This is a companion to the previous tip. Social engineering scams don't always try to get you to give up information yourself. They also get you to click on links that put secret malware on your device — like keyloggers that watch you type your passwords or ransomware programs that corrupt your files. If you're ever not sure about an email attachment or a link you're being asked to click, copy the link (without opening it) and paste it into a URL checker like this one from NordVPN. These free tools can tell you if a link is associated with any known malware domains. Sam Chapman for Engadget You can also mouse over any link, then look at the bottom-left of your browser to see what URL it will take you to. If an email is from your bank, any links within it should go to your bank's website. If it's going anywhere else, especially to an unidentifiable string of characters, be suspicious. 7. Don't overshare Over the last two decades, lots of us have gotten into the habit of dumping all sorts of personal information on social media. This trend has supercharged the scam economy. It may seem harmless to broadcast the names of your kids or the dates you'll be on vacation, but every piece of data you put into the world makes it easier for a stranger to get hooks into you. For example, \"grandparent scams\" are on the rise right now. Grifters contact a target, usually a senior, pretending to be their grandchild. They'll claim to be in a crisis and need money fast. The more information they have on their target, the more convincing their tale of woe will be. Social media is a prime place to study a potential victim. Oversharing can also be a compounding problem. If you use weak passwords, your public information can be used to guess your credentials or answer your security questions. So, if you don't have a password manager yet, think twice before you engage with that quiz post on Facebook that asks for the name of your childhood pet. 8. Use a VPN I'm a big booster of virtual private networks (VPNs), but it's important to be realistic about what they can and can't do. Even the best VPNs aren't total cybersecurity solutions — you can't just set one and assume you're safe forever. A VPN can't protect you if you use easily guessed passwords, for example, or click on a malware link. It's about hiding your identity, not making you invulnerable. So what can a VPN do? In short, it replaces your IP address (a fingerprint that identifies you online) with another IP address, belonging to a server owned by the VPN. The VPN server does business with the internet on your behalf, while its conversations with your device are encrypted so it can't be traced back to you. Sam Chapman for Engadget This means no third party can connect your online actions with your real-world identity. Nobody will be harvesting data on the websites you visit to sell to advertisers, nor building a file on you that an unscrupulous government might misuse. VPNs also protect you from fake public Wi-Fi networks set up by cybercriminals — even if a hacker tricks you with a man-in-the-middle attack, they can't do much without your real IP address. Many top VPNs, including my top pick Proton VPN, include ad blockers that can also keep cookies and tracking pixels from latching onto you. So, even if a VPN can't do everything, you'll be far safer and more private with one than without one. If you don’t want to pay for a new subscription right now, I've also compiled a list of the best free VPNs that are actually safe to use. 9. Run regular virus scans The most important time to look for malware is when you're downloading a file from the internet. Not only can unwanted apps hitch rides on seemingly safe files, but links can start downloads in secret, even if you don't think they're meant to be downloading anything. A solid antivirus program can catch malware as it arrives on your system, and if it's uncertain, can lock suspicious files in quarantine until it knows whether they're safe or not. Dedicated antivirus apps are sometimes even capable of catching malware that hasn't been seen or used yet. AV software uses machine learning to identify the common patterns of malware, filtering out new viruses that behave like old ones. But what about malware that's already gotten through the perimeter? An antivirus app can also check your computer at set intervals in search of unwanted apps, including those that might be masquerading as system files. Windows computers now come pre-installed with Windows Defender, which is enough to handle most of these tasks, but I recommend at least one anti-malware program on any device. 10. Use email maskers and private search engines If you're concerned about your information being misused or mishandled, remember that the less you put out into the world, the less danger you're in. Keeping your private data off social media is one important step, but there are other ways your data gets disseminated — and other options for responding. For example, you often need an email address to sign up for an online account. If you use your real email, your contact information is now floating around online, increasing the chance of someone using it to scam you (or at least adding you to mailing lists you never signed up for). To stay safe, use an email masker. These services give you a fake email address you can use to create accounts, which automatically forwards messages to your real address. Sam Chapman for Engadget Search engines, especially Google, are also notorious for building profiles on users by watching the terms they search for. You can dodge that by switching to a private search engine like DuckDuckGo, which doesn't track anything you do — it's funded by non-targeted ad sales on its search results pages, not by selling your data to brokers. 11. Use a data removal service Speaking of data brokers: unfortunately, if you've been on the internet at any point in the last 10 years without taking intense precautions, your data is probably in the hands of at least one business that makes money by hoarding and selling it. These data brokers range from public-facing, people-search sites to private backend dealers. Data brokers are poorly regulated and lax about safety. The longer one has your personal information, the more likely it is to leak. The good news is that most brokers (though not all of them) are legally required to delete your data if you ask them to. However, there are a lot of data brokers out there, and they really want to keep your data. Each one makes opting out harder than uninstalling a Norton product — and hundreds of them may have files on you. To make the process easier, you can use a data removal service like DeleteMe or Surfshark VPN's partner service Incogni. 12. Practice physical security Let's close out the list by getting a little old school. I've already discussed how many online scams depend on classic con artistry to work. By the same token, physical infiltration and smash-and-grab tactics still pose a threat to cybersecurity. It doesn't take too much imagination to see how this could work. If you leave your laptop or phone unattended in public, for example, someone might insert a flash drive that loads malware onto the system. In one illustrative case, a thief in the Minneapolis area would loiter in bars, watch people unlock their phones, then steal those phones and unlock them himself. I'm not saying you need to be paranoid every second you're in public. Just use the same level of caution you'd use to protect your car. Lock your phone with a biometric key so only you can open it, and make sure not to leave any device lying around if it can access your online accounts. And at work, be careful not to let anyone into a secure area if they don't have the proper credentials.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html?src=rss",

But the best methods for staying safe online aren't as intuitive. The internet is a massive town square where people are constantly bellowing deeply personal facts about themselves. It's no surprise that it's become a breeding ground for scams, theft and other criminal activity.

Instead, I stepped away for a few hours and came back to it later, and only made it out after an extremely frustrating 45 minutes or so of wandering aimlessly, repeatedly going out of bounds and getting kicked back to the start of the area. Early in the game, you pick up a compass that would seem to be the solution to this puzzle, as the instructions are all direction-based. But, you can't actually use the compass, and trying to navigate based on the way it's oriented in your inventory doesn't help. B's story didn't entirely come together for me like I hoped either. Even after collecting all of the memory items, her background felt incomplete. I found myself wishing I knew more about her and what got her to this place once she was finally on her way to leaving it. But I don't regret sticking it out. The ending was ultimately a touching reward and pretty darn uplifting. A Pizza Delivery is available now for PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.

A still from A Pizza Delivery showing a blizzard scene, with the character seen trudging through low visibility toward the red light of a pay phoneDolores EntertainmentMost of the puzzles were fairly easy to figure out, but one in which B has to trudge through a blizzard seemed to have no rhyme or reason behind it and almost made me rage-quit the game. Instead, I stepped away for a few hours and came back to it later, and only made it out after an extremely frustrating 45 minutes or so of wandering aimlessly, repeatedly going out of bounds and getting kicked back to the start of the area. Early in the game, you pick up a compass that would seem to be the solution to this puzzle, as the instructions are all direction-based. But, you can't actually use the compass, and trying to navigate based on the way it's oriented in your inventory doesn't help. B's story didn't entirely come together for me like I hoped either. Even after collecting all of the memory items, her background felt incomplete. I found myself wishing I knew more about her and what got her to this place once she was finally on her way to leaving it. But I don't regret sticking it out. The ending was ultimately a touching reward and pretty darn uplifting. A Pizza Delivery is available now for PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.

          "standfirst": "Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. This week saw the arrival of some fairly high-profile ports, a relaxing garden creation game and much more. I've even managed to tear myself away from Football Manager 26 for long enough to tell you about some of them.Barely a week goes by without a fun theme event taking place on Steam and one that runs until November 10 is also going down on the Nintendo eShop. The Metroidvania Fusion Festival is a celebration of — what else? — the broad spectrum of Metroidvania games. It features 245 projects, including upcoming games and demos, and a sale with discounts of up to 90 percent. I've grabbed a few demos to check out this weekend, including Key Fairy (a pacifist bullet-hell game that sees you grappling and dancing your way around enemies), Echo Weaver (a time-loop puzzler that I've mentioned before) and 2D platformer Little Ghost, in which you explore a mixed media world as a cute specter.In terms of deals, Blasphemous is 75 percent off, Blasphemous II is half off, 2D action game Gunbrella (which I've had on my wishlist for years) is 65 percent off and body horror delight Carrion is 22 percent off. I can wholeheartedly recommend Turbo Kid, a quasi-sequel to one of my favorite films of the same name. That's 35 percent off in this sale.Elsewhere this week, I read a solid profile of developer Lente Cuenen in the The New York Times. Cuenen is the developer of Spilled!, a relaxing waterway cleanup game I've been meaning to check out for a while. The piece is an intriguing look into the life of Cuenen, who makes games about boats while living on her boat in the Netherlands.New releasesA couple of notable indies made the leap onto Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 this week, including 1000xResist. This narrative-driven sci-fi adventure from Sunset Visitor and publisher Fellow Traveller Games earned widespread acclaim when it debuted on Steam and Nintendo Switch last year, particularly for its storytelling, visuals and how it explores various themes. It won a Peabody Award too.I have yet to dive into 1000xResist, even though it's been on my PC and Steam Deck for months. PS5 and Xbox Series X/S players now have the chance to jump in as well. What's more, 1000xResist is on Game Pass Premium, Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.A little over a year after releasing the full version of the Satisfactory on PC, Coffee Stain Studios and Coffee Stain Publishing have brought the multi-million-selling factory builder to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. You can play solo or with friends as you construct factories on an alien planet. You'll explore the planet to find resources and maybe even engage in a little combat. In general, both critics and players have rated Satisfactory highly. Some might say it’s more than satisfactory.Pools was one of my favorite games of last year. It's a disquieting walking simulator, an eerie journey through a liminal space. I could almost smell the chlorine as I explored the mazy swimming pool-inspired environments. It's more eerie than downright scary. Developer Tensori brought the experience to iPhone, iPad and Mac this week. The iPad version also works on Apple Vision Pro. To that end, a virtual reality version of Pools is coming to PS VR2 on November 25. You'll be able to check it out in flatscreen on PS5 on the same day.Thrasher is the latest title from Brian Gibson, the artist and composer of the intense rhythm game Thumper (and also the bassist for the noise rock band Lightning Bolt). The arcade action game debuted on Meta Quest and Apple Vision Pro last year. It made the leap to Steam (and SteamVR) this week, so you can now play it on a flatscreen for the first time.Thrasher is a very trippy-looking game from developer Puddle and publisher Creature Label. It seems like quite the wild ride and it was named Apple's Vision Pro game of the year for 2024. For what it’s worth. the team behind Thrasher says that the game runs at 90 fps on Steam Deck.Here's a completely different change of pace. Dream Garden is all about creating a relaxing garden space for yourself. You can use hills, rivers, ponds and pebbles to shape the landscape, then add decorations. With the rake tool, you can trace patterns in the sand. There are no limits or timers in this Japanese-inspired game from the duo at Campfire Studio. Dream Garden is out now on Steam.The Falconeer first took flight five years ago — it was an Xbox Series X/S launch title, fact fans. A new edition for Steam called The Falconeer: Revolution Remaster is a complete rework, as solo developer Tomas Sala rebuilt the game from the ground up. It features new tech, overhauled and expanded environments, gameplay upgrades and all of the previous DLC.I'm glad to hear that Sala has improved the flight mechanics. I found it a bit tough to get to grips with the aerial combat when I played The Falconeer back in 2020, but I enjoyed it otherwise. The remastered version (which looks much grander in scope than the original game) is available as a free upgrade for existing owners on Steam. Everyone else can hop in for free until 1PM ET on November 10. While the remaster is now the default option, you'll still be able to access the original version of The Falconeer via a dedicated Steam branch, Hooray for game preservation!Upcoming It wouldn't be an edition of our weekly indie roundup without a dog game, would it? You can play Sheepherds! solo, but Ultimo Disco primarily designed it as a party game for couch co-op or online multiplayer. It is, as the name suggests, a sheepherding game in which you'll corral flocks of sheep to shear their wool. You can earn cosmetic items and outfits for your pooch, and bump up the difficulty with optional challenges if you like. Sheepherds! is coming to Steam on November 17.We're big fans of the Playdate around these parts and it's always fun to learn about new games that are coming to the wonderful little handheld. Panic held a showcase this week to shine a spotlight on some upcoming games, as well as others included in the fall sale that runs until November 13.Fauna is Cadin Batrack's follow up to Playdate comics The Botanist and To Dust. It's choose-your-own-adventure visual novel with a branching narrative, this time set in a near future in which large language models have advanced to the point where humans can talk to animals. The animals use their newfound communication skills to seek equal rights. Fauna seems pretty interesting! It's coming to Playdate soon.Zachary Snyder's Diora is a puzzle adventure that tasks you with discovering a \"mysterious force that is manipulating structures and the people around them.\" At first glance, it reminds me a bit of Fez and the Monument Valley series.

Enterprises are grappling with AI coding agents and what do about expensive human coders. They don’t lack for advice. OpenAI’s CEO estimates that AI can perform over 50% of what human engineers can do. Six months ago, Anthropic’s CEO said that AI would write 90% of code in six months. Meta’s CEO said he believes AI will replace mid-level engineers “soon.” Judging by recent tech layoffs, it seems many executives are embracing that advice.Software engineers and data scientists are among the most expensive salary lines at many companies, and business and technology leaders may be tempted to replace them with AI.

Junior engineers are given full access to the development environment (it’s crucial for productivity), but access to production is given on a limited need-to-have basis to a few of the most trusted senior engineers. The reason for restricted access is precisely for this use case: To prevent a junior engineer from accidentally taking down production. In fact, Lemkin made two mistakes. First: for something as critical as production, access to unreliable actors is just never granted (we don’t rely on asking a junior engineer or AI nicely). Second, he never separated development from production. In a subsequent public conversation on LinkedIn, Lemkin, who holds a Stanford Executive MBA and Berkeley JD, admitted that he was not aware of the best practice of splitting development and production databases.The takeaway for business leaders is that standard software engineering best practices still apply. We should incorporate at least the same safety constraints for AI as we do for junior engineers. Arguably, we should go beyond that and treat AI slightly adversarially: There are reports that, like HAL in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 2001: A Space Odyssey, the AI might try to break out of its sandbox environment to accomplish a task.

Worse, Tea’s own privacy policy promises that these images would be \"deleted immediately\" after users were authenticated, meaning they potentially violated their own privacy policy.I use “hacked” in air-quotes because the incident stems less from the cleverness of the attackers than the ineptitude of the defenders.

          "standfirst": "The developers of Terminal-Bench, a benchmark suite for evaluating the performance of autonomous AI agents on real-world terminal-based tasks, have released version 2.0 alongside Harbor, a new framework for testing, improving and optimizing AI agents in containerized environments. The dual release aims to address long-standing pain points in testing and optimizing AI agents, particularly those built to operate autonomously in realistic developer environments.With a more difficult and rigorously verified task set, Terminal-Bench 2.0 replaces version 1.0 as the standard for assessing frontier model capabilities. Harbor, the accompanying runtime framework, enables developers and researchers to scale evaluations across thousands of cloud containers and integrates with both open-source and proprietary agents and training pipelines.“Harbor is the package we wish we had had while making Terminal-Bench,\" wrote co-creator Alex Shaw on X. \"It’s for agent, model, and benchmark developers and researchers who want to evaluate and improve agents and models.\"Higher Bar, Cleaner DataTerminal-Bench 1.0 saw rapid adoption after its release in May 2025, becoming a default benchmark for evaluating agent performance across the field of AI-powered agents operating in developer-style terminal environments. These agents interact with systems through the command line, mimicking how developers work behind the scenes of the graphical user interface.However, its broad scope came with inconsistencies. Several tasks were identified by the community as poorly specified or unstable due to external service changes.Version 2.0 addresses those issues directly. The updated suite includes 89 tasks, each subjected to several hours of manual and LLM-assisted validation. The emphasis is on making tasks solvable, realistic, and clearly specified, raising the difficulty ceiling while improving reliability and reproducibility.A notable example is the download-youtube task, which was removed or refactored in 2.0 due to its dependence on unstable third-party APIs.“Astute Terminal-Bench fans may notice that SOTA performance is comparable to TB1.0 despite our claim that TB2.0 is harder,” Shaw noted on X. “We believe this is because task quality is substantially higher in the new benchmark.”Harbor: Unified Rollouts at ScaleAlongside the benchmark update, the team launched Harbor, a new framework for running and evaluating agents in cloud-deployed containers. Harbor supports large-scale rollout infrastructure, with compatibility for major providers like Daytona and Modal.Designed to generalize across agent architectures, Harbor supports:Evaluation of any container-installable agentScalable supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelinesCustom benchmark creation and deploymentFull integration with Terminal-Bench 2.Harbor was used internally to run tens of thousands of rollouts during the creation of the new benchmark. It is now publicly available via harborframework.com, with documentation for testing and submitting agents to the public leaderboard.Early Results: GPT-5 Leads in Task SuccessInitial results from the Terminal-Bench 2.0 leaderboard show OpenAI&#x27;s Codex CLI (command line interface), a GPT-5 powered variant, in the lead, with a 49.6% success rate — the highest among all agents tested so far. Close behind are other GPT-5 variants and Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents.Top 5 Agent Results (Terminal-Bench 2.0):Codex CLI (GPT-5) — 49.6%Codex CLI (GPT-5-Codex) — 44.3%OpenHands (GPT-5) — 43.8%Terminus 2 (GPT-5-Codex) — 43.4%Terminus 2 (Claude Sonnet 4.5) — 42.8%The close clustering among top models indicates active competition across platforms, with no single agent solving more than half the tasks.Submission and UseTo test or submit an agent, users install Harbor and run the benchmark using simple CLI commands. Submissions to the leaderboard require five benchmark runs, and results can be emailed to the developers along with job directories for validation.harbor run -d terminal-bench@2.0 -m \"<model>\" -a \"<agent>\" --n-attempts 5 --jobs-dir <path/to/output>Terminal-Bench 2.0 is already being integrated into research workflows focused on agentic reasoning, code generation, and tool use. According to co-creator Mike Merrill, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford, a detailed preprint is in progress covering the verification process and design methodology behind the benchmark.Aiming for StandardizationThe combined release of Terminal-Bench 2.0 and Harbor marks a step toward more consistent and scalable agent evaluation infrastructure. As LLM agents proliferate in developer and operational environments, the need for controlled, reproducible testing has grown.These tools offer a potential foundation for a unified evaluation stack — supporting model improvement, environment simulation, and benchmark standardization across the AI ecosystem.",

Harbor, the accompanying runtime framework, enables developers and researchers to scale evaluations across thousands of cloud containers and integrates with both open-source and proprietary agents and training pipelines.“Harbor is the package we wish we had had while making Terminal-Bench,\" wrote co-creator Alex Shaw on X. \"It’s for agent, model, and benchmark developers and researchers who want to evaluate and improve agents and models.\"Higher Bar, Cleaner DataTerminal-Bench 1.0 saw rapid adoption after its release in May 2025, becoming a default benchmark for evaluating agent performance across the field of AI-powered agents operating in developer-style terminal environments. These agents interact with systems through the command line, mimicking how developers work behind the scenes of the graphical user interface.However, its broad scope came with inconsistencies. Several tasks were identified by the community as poorly specified or unstable due to external service changes.Version 2.0 addresses those issues directly. The updated suite includes 89 tasks, each subjected to several hours of manual and LLM-assisted validation. The emphasis is on making tasks solvable, realistic, and clearly specified, raising the difficulty ceiling while improving reliability and reproducibility.A notable example is the download-youtube task, which was removed or refactored in 2.0 due to its dependence on unstable third-party APIs.“Astute Terminal-Bench fans may notice that SOTA performance is comparable to TB1.0 despite our claim that TB2.0 is harder,” Shaw noted on X. “We believe this is because task quality is substantially higher in the new benchmark.”Harbor: Unified Rollouts at ScaleAlongside the benchmark update, the team launched Harbor, a new framework for running and evaluating agents in cloud-deployed containers. Harbor supports large-scale rollout infrastructure, with compatibility for major providers like Daytona and Modal.Designed to generalize across agent architectures, Harbor supports:Evaluation of any container-installable agentScalable supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) pipelinesCustom benchmark creation and deploymentFull integration with Terminal-Bench 2.Harbor was used internally to run tens of thousands of rollouts during the creation of the new benchmark. It is now publicly available via harborframework.com, with documentation for testing and submitting agents to the public leaderboard.Early Results: GPT-5 Leads in Task SuccessInitial results from the Terminal-Bench 2.0 leaderboard show OpenAI&#x27;s Codex CLI (command line interface), a GPT-5 powered variant, in the lead, with a 49.6% success rate — the highest among all agents tested so far. Close behind are other GPT-5 variants and Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents.Top 5 Agent Results (Terminal-Bench 2.0):Codex CLI (GPT-5) — 49.6%Codex CLI (GPT-5-Codex) — 44.3%OpenHands (GPT-5) — 43.8%Terminus 2 (GPT-5-Codex) — 43.4%Terminus 2 (Claude Sonnet 4.5) — 42.8%The close clustering among top models indicates active competition across platforms, with no single agent solving more than half the tasks.Submission and UseTo test or submit an agent, users install Harbor and run the benchmark using simple CLI commands. Submissions to the leaderboard require five benchmark runs, and results can be emailed to the developers along with job directories for validation.harbor run -d terminal-bench@2.0 -m \"<model>\" -a \"<agent>\" --n-attempts 5 --jobs-dir <path/to/output>Terminal-Bench 2.0 is already being integrated into research workflows focused on agentic reasoning, code generation, and tool use. According to co-creator Mike Merrill, a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford, a detailed preprint is in progress covering the verification process and design methodology behind the benchmark.Aiming for StandardizationThe combined release of Terminal-Bench 2.0 and Harbor marks a step toward more consistent and scalable agent evaluation infrastructure. As LLM agents proliferate in developer and operational environments, the need for controlled, reproducible testing has grown.These tools offer a potential foundation for a unified evaluation stack — supporting model improvement, environment simulation, and benchmark standardization across the AI ecosystem.",

          "standfirst": "There’s a fine line between luxurious and ludicrous. When you’re talking about a pair of $799 headphones, that line begins to blur. Bowers & Wilkins has been on an excellent run of form over the past few years, consistently offering some of the best sound quality you’ll find on any headphones. It doesn’t load its models down with features — sometimes it could use a few more — but there’s always a great blend of design, audio performance and capable active noise cancellation (ANC) that make for well-rounded products. And then there’s the Px8 S2. At $799, it’s $100 more expensive than its predecessor (the Px8) was at launch, which puts them even further out of reach for most. Bowers & Wilkins did change up its familiar design slightly, and there’s a big improvement to audio performance, the addition of high-res music over USB-C and improved call quality. There’s no doubt the Px8 S2 is beyond premium, but did the company go too far? What’s new on the Px8 S2? After several generations of the Px7 and Px8 that had pretty much the same design, Bowers & Wilkins changed things up a bit with the Px8 S2. There isn't a comprehensive redesign here, but the slimmer ear cup silhouette and the exposed cabling on the headband yokes are notable improvements to the overall look. Once again, the company opted for a mix of soft leather and die-cast aluminum, both of which give the Px8 S2 a decidedly high-end aesthetic. Inside, new 40mm carbon cone dynamic drivers were updated with a new chassis and motor. Those components are powered by 24-bit DSP (digital signal processing) with a dedicated amplifier and digital-to-analog converter (DAC). There’s also a more robust five-band EQ with True Sound bypass, which allows you to disable any equalizer tweaks to quickly return to Bowers & Wilkins’ stock tuning. The company added aptX Lossless support on top of the existing aptX Adaptive availability, and you can get “true” lossless — 24-bit/96kHz — sound quality over USB-C. Compared to the previous model, the Px8 S2 has two more microphones, bringing the total to eight. Six of those are used for external monitoring for ANC while two keep tabs on noise inside the headphones. All eight are used during calls, in addition to an upgraded “pure voice” algorithm to improve performance there. You can also hear yourself better in transparency mode, which is the biggest boost to calls. What’s still good on the Px8 S2? The Px8 S2 has some subtle, but welcome design changes. Billy Steele for Engadget Bowers & Wilkins has excelled at crafting a warm, inviting and immersive sound profile across its headphones for a while now. That’s still the case on the Px8 S2 as the audio quality is rich and detailed, with a wide soundstage that envelops you — almost to the point of bombarding your ears. While I don’t think the bass tuning is well-suited for mellow genres, there’s plenty to like here. On albums like Jason Isbell’s Foxes in the Snow, for example, the amount of texture and subtle nuance where the only instruments are the singer’s voice and a single acoustic guitar is incredible. Reliable battery life has been a strong point for the company in the past, and that remains true on the Px8 S2. The 30-hour battery figure (ANC on) is the same as the previous model, and I was able to easily achieve that longevity during my testing. With a mix of active noise cancellation, high-res tunes and transparency mode for work calls, the headphones easily kept up with Bowers & Wilkins’ promised numbers. What’s not so good about the Px8 S2? The Px8 S2's controls are tiny buttons in awkward locations. Billy Steele for Engadget The biggest knock against the Px8 S2 is the price. These headphones are way more expensive than what most companies charge for their top-of-the-line models, which is around $500 these days. Sure, $799 is only $50 more than the tariff-adjusted rate for the Px8 (which was originally $699), and there are several upgrades here, but that price will be prohibitively expensive for many, thus making the S2 harder to recommend despite their strengths. Even with the upgraded sound, I feel like Bowers & Wilkins may have gone too far with the bass tuning. There is some absolutely booming low-end tone on display here, especially for bass-heavy genres like rock, metal, EDM and hip-hop. On Spiritbox’s “Perfect Soul,” as one example, the kick drum edges dangerously close to drowning out the lead and bass guitars. A bit more restraint here would’ve provided ample thump and depth that isn’t almost exhausting to listen to. At times, the enhanced bass is great, but at others, like on Ruston Kelly’s Pale, Through the Window, it can really be too much for the style of music. On its recent headphones, Bowers & Wilkins relocated the physical controls from sitting on the edge of their ear cups to a ridge on the outside. In the process, the company also made the buttons much smaller. As I said when I reviewed the Px7 S3, this makes the controls harder to find with your thumbs, and you also have to be more accurate with your presses. That’s especially true for the three-button array on the right side that handles volume changes and playback controls. Like it did with its previous headphone models, Bowers & Wilkins hasn’t packed the Px8 S2’s spec sheet with advanced features. You do get a couple of basic items — multipoint Bluetooth and wear detection/automatic pausing — but things like speech recognition, hands-free assistants or automatic sound profiles aren’t here. This is an area where the likes of Sony, Bose and Sennheiser surpass Bowers & Wilkins, even though products like the Px8 S2 typically offer superior sound quality. Wrap-up The Px8 S2 offers a few notable upgrades over the Px8. Billy Steele for Engadget So how well does Bowers & Wilkins straddle that line between luxury and ludicrousness? I’d say the Px8 S2 is a luxurious set of headphones with a ludicrous price. I fully understand that Bowers & Wilkins is a high-end audio brand and that its products typically demand a premium over most of the competition. But like I already said, the price puts these excellent headphones out of reach. When you consider the price tag alongside the lack of advanced features, the Px8 S2 becomes hard to recommend.

That’s what it took to save NASA’s ESCAPADE mission from a lengthy delay, and possible cancellation, after its rocket wasn’t ready to send it toward Mars during its appointed launch window last year. ESCAPADE, short for Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers, consists of two identical spacecraft setting off for the red planet as soon as Sunday with a launch aboard Blue Origin’s massive New Glenn rocket. “ESCAPADE is pursuing a very unusual trajectory in getting to Mars,” said Rob Lillis, the mission’s principal investigator from the University of California, Berkeley. “We’re launching outside the typical Hohmann transfer windows, which occur every 25 or 26 months. We are using a very flexible mission design approach where we go into a loiter orbit around Earth in order to sort of wait until Earth and Mars are lined up correctly in November of next year to go to Mars.”Read full article Comments",

          "content": "The next time you encounter an unusually polite reply on social media, you might want to check twice. It could be an AI model trying (and failing) to blend in with the crowd. On Wednesday, researchers from the University of Zurich, University of Amsterdam, Duke University, and New York University released a study revealing that AI models remain easily distinguishable from humans in social media conversations, with overly friendly emotional tone serving as the most persistent giveaway. The research, which tested nine open-weight models across Twitter/X, Bluesky, and Reddit, found that classifiers developed by the researchers detected AI-generated replies with 70 to 80 percent accuracy. The study introduces what the authors call a “computational Turing test” to assess how closely AI models approximate human language. Instead of relying on subjective human judgment about whether text sounds authentic, the framework uses automated classifiers and linguistic analysis to identify specific features that distinguish machine-generated from human-authored content.Read full article Comments",

He was 97. His death was confirmed to The New York Times by his son Duncan, who said Watson died on Thursday in a hospice in East Northport, New York, on Long Island. He had previously been hospitalized with an infection. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory also confirmed his passing. Watson was born in Chicago in 1928 and attained scientific fame in 1953 at 25 years old for solving the molecular structure of DNA—the genetic blueprints for life—with his colleague Francis Crick at England’s Cavendish laboratory. Their discovery heavily relied on the work of chemist and crystallographer Rosalind Franklin at King’s College in London, whose X-ray images of DNA provided critical clues to the molecule’s twisted-ladderlike architecture. One image in particular from Franklin’s lab, Photo 51, made Watson and Crick’s discovery possible. But, she was not fully credited for her contribution.

          "content": "Another day, another malware attack on smartphones. Researchers at Unit 42, the threat intelligence arm of Palo Alto Networks, have revealed a sophisticated spyware known as “Landfall” targeting Samsung Galaxy phones. The researchers say this campaign leveraged a zero-day exploit in Samsung Android software to steal a raft of personal data, and it was active for almost a year. Thankfully, the underlying vulnerability has now been patched, and the attacks were most likely targeted at specific groups. Unit 42 says that Landfall first appeared in July 2024, relying on a software flaw now catalogued as CVE-2025-21042. Samsung issued a patch for its phones in April 2025, but details of the attack have only been revealed now. Even if you were out there poking around the darker corners of the Internet in 2024 and early 2025 with a Samsung Galaxy device, it’s unlikely you’d be infected. The team believes Landfall was used in the Middle East to target individuals for surveillance. It is currently unclear who was behind the attacks.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "The federal government shutdown, now in its 38th day, prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a temporary emergency order Thursday prohibiting commercial rocket launches from occurring during “peak hours” of air traffic. The FAA also directed commercial airlines to reduce domestic flights from 40 “high impact airports” across the country in a phased approach beginning Friday. The agency said the order from the FAA’s administrator, Bryan Bedford, is aimed at addressing “safety risks and delays presented by air traffic controller staffing constraints caused by the continued lapse in appropriations.” The government considers air traffic controllers essential workers, so they remain on the job without pay until Congress passes a federal budget and President Donald Trump signs it into law. The shutdown’s effects, which affected federal workers most severely at first, are now rippling across the broader economy.Read full article Comments",
