Developers can now generate well-structured code from plain language prompts, saving hours of manual effort. These tools learn from vast codebases, offering context-aware recommendations that enhance productivity and reduce errors. Rather than starting from scratch, engineers can prototype quickly, iterate faster and focus on solving increasingly complex problems.As code generation tools grow in popularity, they raise questions about the future size and structure of engineering teams. Earlier this year, Garry Tan, CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator, noted that about one-quarter of its current clients use AI to write 95% or more of their software. In an interview with CNBC, Tan said: “What that means for founders is that you don’t need a team of 50 or 100 engineers, you don’t have to raise as much. The capital goes much longer.”AI-powered coding may offer a fast solution for businesses under budget pressure — but its long-term effects on the field and labor pool cannot be ignored.As AI-powered coding rises, human expertise may diminish In the era of AI, the traditional journey to coding expertise that has long supported senior developers may be at risk. Easy access to large language models (LLMs) enables junior coders to quickly identify issues in code. While this speeds up software development, it can distance developers from their own work, delaying the growth of core problem-solving skills. As a result, they may avoid the focused, sometimes uncomfortable hours required to build expertise and progress on the path to becoming successful senior developers.Consider Anthropic’s Claude Code, a terminal-based assistant built on the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, which automates bug detection and resolution, test creation and code refactoring. Using natural language commands, it reduces repetitive manual work and boosts productivity.Microsoft has also released two open-source frameworks — AutoGen and Semantic Kernel — to support the development of agentic AI systems. AutoGen enables asynchronous messaging, modular components, and distributed agent collaboration to build complex workflows with minimal human input. Semantic Kernel is an SDK that integrates LLMs with languages like C#, Python and Java, letting developers build AI agents to automate tasks and manage enterprise applications.The increasing availability of these tools from Anthropic, Microsoft and others may reduce opportunities for coders to refine and deepen their skills. Rather than “banging their heads against the wall” to debug a few lines or select a library to unlock new features, junior developers may simply turn to AI for an assist. This means senior coders with problem-solving skills honed over decades may become an endangered species.Overreliance on AI for writing code risks weakening developers’ hands-on experience and understanding of key programming concepts. Without regular practice, they may struggle to independently debug, optimize or design systems. Ultimately, this erosion of skill can undermine critical thinking, creativity and adaptability — qualities that are essential not just for coding, but for assessing the quality and logic of AI-generated solutions.AI as mentor: Turning code automation into hands-on learningWhile concerns about AI diminishing human developer skills are valid, businesses shouldn’t dismiss AI-supported coding. They just need to think carefully about when and how to deploy AI tools in development. These tools can be more than productivity boosters; they can act as interactive mentors, guiding coders in real time with explanations, alternatives and best practices.When used as a training tool, AI can reinforce learning by showing coders why code is broken and how to fix it—rather than simply applying a solution. For example, a junior developer using Claude Code might receive immediate feedback on inefficient syntax or logic errors, along with suggestions linked to detailed explanations. This enables active learning, not passive correction. It’s a win-win: Accelerating project timelines without doing all the work for junior coders.Additionally, coding frameworks can support experimentation by letting developers prototype agent workflows or integrate LLMs without needing expert-level knowledge upfront. By observing how AI builds and refines code, junior developers who actively engage with these tools can internalize patterns, architectural decisions and debugging strategies — mirroring the traditional learning process of trial and error, code reviews and mentorship.However, AI coding assistants shouldn’t replace real mentorship or pair programming. Pull requests and formal code reviews remain essential for guiding newer, less experienced team members. We are nowhere near the point at which AI can single-handedly upskill a junior developer.Companies and educators can build structured development programs around these tools that emphasize code comprehension to ensure AI is used as a training partner rather than a crutch.

In this way, AI becomes less of a replacement for human ingenuity and more of a catalyst for accelerated, experiential learning.Bridging the gap between automation and educationWhen utilized with intention, AI doesn’t just write code; it teaches coding, blending automation with education to prepare developers for a future where deep understanding and adaptability remain indispensable.By embracing AI as a mentor, as a programming partner and as a team of developers we can direct to the problem at hand, we can bridge the gap between effective automation and education.

          "standfirst": "How a semiconductor veteran turned over a century of horticultural wisdom into AI-led competitive advantage For decades, a ritual played out across ScottsMiracle-Gro’s media facilities. Every few weeks, workers walked acres of towering compost and wood chip piles with nothing more than measuring sticks. They wrapped rulers around each mound, estimated height, and did what company President Nate Baxter now describes as “sixth-grade geometry to figure out volume.”Today, drones glide over those same plants with mechanical precision. Vision systems calculate volumes in real time. The move from measuring sticks to artificial intelligence signals more than efficiency. It is the visible proof of one of corporate America’s most unlikely technology stories.The AI revolution finds an unexpected leaderEnterprise AI has been led by predictable players. Software companies with cloud-native architectures. Financial services firms with vast data lakes. Retailers with rich digital touchpoints. Consumer packaged goods companies that handle physical products like fertilizer and soil were not expected to lead.Yet ScottsMiracle-Gro has realized more than half of a targeted $150 million in supply chain savings. It reports a 90 percent improvement in customer service response times. Its predictive models enable weekly reallocation of marketing resources across regional markets.A Silicon Valley veteran bets on soil scienceBaxter’s path to ScottsMiracle-Gro (SMG) reads like a calculated pivot, not a corporate rescue. After two decades in semiconductor manufacturing at Intel and Tokyo Electron, he knew how to apply advanced technology to complex operations.“I sort of initially said, ‘Why would I do this? I’m running a tech company. It’s an industry I’ve been in for 25 years,’” Baxter recalls of his reaction when ScottsMiracle-Gro CEO Jim Hagedorn approached him in 2023. The company was reeling from a collapsed $1.2 billion hydroponics investment and facing what he describes as “pressure from a leverage standpoint.”His wife challenged him with a direct prompt. If you are not learning or putting yourself in uncomfortable situations, you should change that.Baxter saw clear parallels between semiconductor manufacturing and SMG’s operations. Both require precision, quality control, and the optimization of complex systems. He also saw untapped potential in SMG’s domain knowledge. One hundred fifty years of horticultural expertise, regulatory know-how, and customer insight had never been fully digitized.“It became apparent to me whether it was on the backend with data analytics, business process transformation, and obviously now with AI being front and center of the consumer experience, a lot of opportunities are there,” he explains.The declaration that changed everythingThe pivot began at an all-hands meeting. “I just said, you know, guys, we’re a tech company. You just don’t know it yet,” Baxter recalls. “There’s so much opportunity here to drive this company to where it needs to go.”The first challenge was organizational. SMG had evolved into functional silos. IT, supply chain, and brand teams ran independent systems with little coordination. Drawing on his experience with complex technology organizations, Baxter restructured the consumer business into three business units. General managers became accountable not just for financial results but also for technology implementation within their domains.“I came in and said, we’re going to create new business units,” he explains. “The buck stops with you and I’m holding you accountable not only for the business results, for the quality of the creative and marketing, but for the implementation of technology.”To support the new structure, SMG set up centers of excellence for digital capabilities, insights and analytics, and creative functions. The hybrid design placed centralized expertise behind distributed accountability.Mining corporate memory for AI goldTurning legacy knowledge into machine-ready intelligence required what Fausto Fleites, VP of Data Intelligence, calls “archaeological work.” The team excavated decades of business logic embedded in legacy SAP systems and converted filing cabinets of research into AI-ready datasets. Fleites, a Cuban immigrant with a doctorate from FIU who led Florida’s public hurricane loss model before roles at Sears and Cemex, understood the stakes.“The costly part of the migration was the business reporting layer we have in SAP Business Warehouse,” Fleites explains. “You need to uncover business logic created in many cases over decades.”SMG chose Databricks as its unified data platform. The team had Apache Spark expertise. Databricks offered strong SAP integration and aligned with a preference for open-source technologies that minimize vendor lock-in.The breakthrough came through systematic knowledge management. SMG built an AI bot using Google’s Gemini large language model to catalog and clean internal repositories. The system identified duplicates, grouped content by topic, and restructured information for AI consumption. The effort reduced knowledge articles by 30 percent while increasing their utility.“We used Gemini LLMs to actually categorize them into topics, find similar documents,” Fleites explains. A hybrid approach that combined modern AI with techniques like cosine similarity became the foundation for later applications.Building AI systems that actually understand fertilizerEarly trials with off-the-shelf AI exposed a real risk. General-purpose models confused products designed for killing weeds with those for preventing them. That mistake can ruin a lawn.“Different products, if you use one in the wrong place, would actually have a very negative outcome,” Fleites notes. “But those are kind of synonyms in certain contexts to the LLM. So they were recommending the wrong products.”The solution was a new architecture. SMG created what Fleites calls a “hierarchy of agents.” A supervisor agent routes queries to specialized worker agents organized by brand. Each agent draws on deep product knowledge encoded from a 400-page internal training manual.The system also changes the conversation. When users ask for recommendations, the agents start with questions about location, goals, and lawn conditions. They narrow possibilities step by step before offering suggestions. The stack integrates with APIs for product availability and state-specific regulatory compliance.From drones to demand forecasting across the enterpriseThe transformation runs across the company. Drones measure inventory piles. Demand forecasting models analyze more than 60 factors, including weather patterns, consumer sentiment, and macroeconomic indicators.These predictions enable faster moves. When drought struck Texas, the models supported a shift in promotional spending to regions with favorable weather. The reallocation helped drive positive quarterly results.“We not only have the ability to move marketing and promotion dollars around, but we’ve even gotten to the point where if it’s going to be a big weekend in the Northeast, we’ll shift our field sales resources from other regions up there,” Baxter explains.Consumer Services changed as well. AI agents now process incoming emails through Salesforce, draft responses based on the knowledge base, and flag them for brief human review. Draft times dropped from ten minutes to seconds and response quality improved.The company emphasizes explainable AI. Using SHAP, SMG built dashboards that decompose each forecast and show how weather, promotions, or media spending contribute to predictions.“Typically, if you open a prediction to a business person and you don’t say why, they’ll say, ‘I don’t believe you,’” Fleites explains. Transparency made it possible to move resource allocation from quarterly to weekly cycles.Competing like a startupSMG’s results challenge assumptions about AI readiness in traditional industries. The advantage does not come from owning the most sophisticated models. It comes from combining general-purpose AI with unique, structured domain knowledge.“LLMs are going to be a commodity,” Fleites observes. “The strategic differentiator is what is the additional level of [internal] knowledge we can fit to them.”Partnerships are central. SMG works with Google Vertex AI for foundational models, Sierra.ai for production-ready conversational agents, and Kindwise for computer vision. The ecosystem approach lets a small internal team recruited from Meta, Google, and AI startups deliver outsized impact without building everything from scratch.Talent follows impact. Conventional wisdom says traditional companies cannot compete with Meta salaries or Google stock. SMG offered something different. It offered the chance to build transformative AI applications with immediate business impact.“When we have these interviews, what we propose to them is basically the ability to have real value with the latest knowledge in these spaces,” Fleites explains. “A lot of people feel motivated to come to us” because much of big tech AI work, despite the hype, “doesn’t really have an impact.”Team design mirrors that philosophy. “My direct reports are leaders and not only manage people, but are technically savvy,” Fleites notes. “We always are constantly switching hands between developing or maintaining a solution versus strategy versus managing people.” He still writes code weekly. The small team of 15 to 20 AI and engineering professionals stays lean by contracting out implementation while keeping “the know-how and the direction and the architecture” in-house.When innovation meets immovable objectsNot every pilot succeeded. SMG tested semi-autonomous forklifts in a 1.3 million square foot distribution facility. Remote drivers in the Philippines controlled up to five vehicles at once with strong safety records.“The technology was actually really great,” Baxter acknowledges. The vehicles could not lift enough weight for SMG’s heavy products. The company paused implementation.“Not everything we’ve tried has gone smoothly,” Baxter admits. “But I think another important point is you have to focus on a few critical ones and you have to know when something isn’t going to work and readjust.”The lesson tracks with semiconductor discipline. Investments must show measurable returns within set timeframes. Regulatory complexity adds difficulty. Products must comply with EPA rules and a patchwork of state restrictions, which AI systems must navigate correctly.The gardening sommelier and agent-to-agent futuresThe roadmap reflects a long-term view. SMG plans a “gardening sommelier” mobile app in 2026 that identifies plants, weeds, and lawn problems from photos and provides instant guidance. A beta already helps field sales teams answer complex product questions by querying the 400-page knowledge base.The company is exploring agent-to-agent communication so its specialized AI can interface with retail partners’ systems. A customer who asks a Walmart chatbot for lawn advice could trigger an SMG query that returns accurate, regulation-compliant recommendations.SMG has launched AI-powered search on its website, replacing keyword systems with conversational engines based on the internal stack. The future vision pairs predictive models with conversational agents so the system can reach out when conditions suggest a customer may need help.What traditional industries can learnScottsMiracle-Gro&#x27;s transformation offers a clear playbook for enterprises. The advantage doesn&#x27;t come from deploying the most sophisticated models. Instead, it comes from combining AI with proprietary domain knowledge that competitors can&#x27;t easily replicate.By making general managers responsible for both business results and technology implementation, SMG ensured AI wasn&#x27;t just an IT initiative but a business imperative. The 150 years of horticultural expertise only became valuable when it was digitized, structured, and made accessible to AI systems.Legacy companies competing for AI engineers can&#x27;t match Silicon Valley compensation packages. But they can offer something tech giants often can&#x27;t: immediate, measurable impact. When engineers see their weather forecasting models directly influence quarterly results or their agent architecture prevent customers from ruining their lawns, the work carries weight that another incremental improvement to an ad algorithm never will.“We have a right to win,” Baxter says. “We have 150 years of this experience.” That experience is now data, and data is the company’s competitive edge. ScottsMiracle-Gro didn’t outspend its rivals or chase the newest AI model. It turned knowledge into an operating system for growth. For a company built on soil, its biggest breakthrough might be cultivating data.",

The ecosystem approach lets a small internal team recruited from Meta, Google, and AI startups deliver outsized impact without building everything from scratch.Talent follows impact. Conventional wisdom says traditional companies cannot compete with Meta salaries or Google stock. SMG offered something different. It offered the chance to build transformative AI applications with immediate business impact.“When we have these interviews, what we propose to them is basically the ability to have real value with the latest knowledge in these spaces,” Fleites explains. “A lot of people feel motivated to come to us” because much of big tech AI work, despite the hype, “doesn’t really have an impact.”Team design mirrors that philosophy. “My direct reports are leaders and not only manage people, but are technically savvy,” Fleites notes. “We always are constantly switching hands between developing or maintaining a solution versus strategy versus managing people.” He still writes code weekly. The small team of 15 to 20 AI and engineering professionals stays lean by contracting out implementation while keeping “the know-how and the direction and the architecture” in-house.When innovation meets immovable objectsNot every pilot succeeded. SMG tested semi-autonomous forklifts in a 1.3 million square foot distribution facility. Remote drivers in the Philippines controlled up to five vehicles at once with strong safety records.“The technology was actually really great,” Baxter acknowledges. The vehicles could not lift enough weight for SMG’s heavy products. The company paused implementation.“Not everything we’ve tried has gone smoothly,” Baxter admits. “But I think another important point is you have to focus on a few critical ones and you have to know when something isn’t going to work and readjust.”The lesson tracks with semiconductor discipline. Investments must show measurable returns within set timeframes. Regulatory complexity adds difficulty. Products must comply with EPA rules and a patchwork of state restrictions, which AI systems must navigate correctly.The gardening sommelier and agent-to-agent futuresThe roadmap reflects a long-term view. SMG plans a “gardening sommelier” mobile app in 2026 that identifies plants, weeds, and lawn problems from photos and provides instant guidance. A beta already helps field sales teams answer complex product questions by querying the 400-page knowledge base.The company is exploring agent-to-agent communication so its specialized AI can interface with retail partners’ systems. A customer who asks a Walmart chatbot for lawn advice could trigger an SMG query that returns accurate, regulation-compliant recommendations.SMG has launched AI-powered search on its website, replacing keyword systems with conversational engines based on the internal stack. The future vision pairs predictive models with conversational agents so the system can reach out when conditions suggest a customer may need help.What traditional industries can learnScottsMiracle-Gro&#x27;s transformation offers a clear playbook for enterprises. The advantage doesn&#x27;t come from deploying the most sophisticated models. Instead, it comes from combining AI with proprietary domain knowledge that competitors can&#x27;t easily replicate.By making general managers responsible for both business results and technology implementation, SMG ensured AI wasn&#x27;t just an IT initiative but a business imperative. The 150 years of horticultural expertise only became valuable when it was digitized, structured, and made accessible to AI systems.Legacy companies competing for AI engineers can&#x27;t match Silicon Valley compensation packages. But they can offer something tech giants often can&#x27;t: immediate, measurable impact. When engineers see their weather forecasting models directly influence quarterly results or their agent architecture prevent customers from ruining their lawns, the work carries weight that another incremental improvement to an ad algorithm never will.“We have a right to win,” Baxter says. “We have 150 years of this experience.” That experience is now data, and data is the company’s competitive edge. ScottsMiracle-Gro didn’t outspend its rivals or chase the newest AI model. It turned knowledge into an operating system for growth. For a company built on soil, its biggest breakthrough might be cultivating data.",

          "standfirst": "You'll get access to Windows 10 a little longer by doing this. (Getty Images) You've known it for a while: Microsoft has determined that it's moving Windows 10 to \"end of life\" status starting on October 14. That means while Windows 10 PCs will continue to work after that date, they'll stop getting important security updates by default. That leaves you with three choices if you want to make sure your computer remains secure: You can choose to upgrade to Windows 11 for free if your computer is compatible. You can buy a new PC that already has Windows 11 pre-installed (or opt for an alternative, like a Mac or a Chromebook). Forget about Windows 11 right now and sign up for the Extended Security Updates (ESU), which lets you kick the can down the road for a year. Since the last one is easy — and can now be done for free in many cases — that's what we're focusing on here. We'll walk you through the steps of keeping Windows 10 on your PC… for now, at least. How to sign up for Windows 10 Extended Security Updates on your computer We can question Microsoft's motives for killing off Windows 10, even though it works perfectly well on most older PCs. But without those periodic security updates, your PC will become increasingly susceptible to malware with each passing week. To that end, enrolling in Extended Security Updates (ESU) will give you another year of using Windows 10 securely. At one point, Microsoft suggested the 12-month extension would require a $30 fee. While that's still an option, there's now a free path for Windows 10 users in the US. Here's how to make it happen. Step 1: Make sure your PC is up to date You can find out if your computer is up-to-date by going into your Settings > System > About, then scroll down to see what version you're running. If not, you'll want to make sure you also install all the Windows 10 updates available. Step 2: Make sure you're using an administrator account If you share a computer with multiple people in your household, make sure you're signed in to the administrator account. Typically, it's the first account created on the computer. You'll know it's the right one when you see \"Administrator\" under the name. (You can double-check under Settings > Your Info.) Step 3: Verify if your PC is eligible to upgrade to Windows 11 (or not) If you see an option to upgrade to Windows 11, just do that. It's free and it keeps you in the Windows loop. Otherwise, continue following the steps below so you can keep your computer safe with security updates. Step 4: Enroll in Extended Security Updates Sign up for ESU by selecting Update & Security from the Settings menu. Click the \"Enroll Now\" sign-up link, as pictured below. Again, you may see an option to download Windows 11 if your computer meets the requirements (again, definitely do that if you see it). Find out if you need to update your computer. (Screenshot/Engadget) If you're not seeing the \"Enroll now\" link, you probably need to update and install the latest Windows 10 updates (as noted above). By enrolling in Extended Security Updates, you'll have another year before you need to upgrade to Windows 11. (Screenshots/Engadget) Step 5: Choose your upgrade method Next up is choosing how you want to enroll, and you have a few options. The easiest way is to back up your PC settings. It's free, but it takes a little bit of time since you'll need to back up your data. Again, you'll need to be using your administrator account to get started. Back up your PC before you enroll in ESU. (ExplainingComputers via YouTube) That said, the free option here comes with two catches, at least for users in the US. (European users will get the free option with no strings attached.) The first is that you'll be linking your Windows login to Microsoft's cloud-based online service. Most users have likely already done this (if they're using CoPilot, Office 365, GamePass, OneDrive or one of Microsoft's other various online services). But if you've specifically opted for a local login to Windows, the price you're paying for this \"free\" extension is joining the cloud-connected Microsoft universe. The other potential issue is that the free backup only applies to the first 5 GB of storage. Anything more, and you’ll need to pay up for Microsoft's OneDrive services. But thankfully, you can turn off anything you don't want to back up by going to Settings > OneDrive and toggling off options like Documents, Pictures and Videos to get in under the free threshold to start. Once you're signed in, a window will pop up that says \"Add this device to receive Extended Security Updates.\" Click Add Device to enroll it. Click Done. A note: Thanks to YouTube's Explaining Computers channel, where we grabbed the screenshot above (since our test PC was already signed up for cloud backups, and didn't provide the splash screen to choose options). You can watch their full video if you'd like a deeper dive into the process. That's it, you're done! (Until next year) You've got 12 more months to figure out an alternative upgrade path to Windows 11. If anything changes next year, we'll update this story with what your next steps are. You did it right if you see this window.

Some gorgeous new games arrived this week, and we've got some demos and reveals from upcoming projects to take a look at. Later this month, Lorelai and the Laser Eyes studio Simogo is going to celebrate its 15th anniversary with some news and surprises. Perhaps the developer is porting some of its earlier games to more platforms. I'm hoping that we'll learn about Simogo's next game as well.I'm not holding out hope for a sequel to Sayonara Wild Hearts, which is my favorite game of all time depending on the day you ask me (on other days, it's The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, FYI). However, if Simogo announces a live concert of music from the game, I'm going to do my damndest to be there. I'll be tuning in on October 28 to learn what the studio has for me us in any case.Speaking of showcases, Entalto Publishing and developer GGTech ran one of their own this week. The Out of Bounds event shone a spotlight on a dozen indie games, spanning a breadth of genres. Also, a quick reminder that the latest Steam Next Fest starts at 1PM ET on Monday, October 13. As always, the week-long event will have tons of demos for you to check out. It’s always worth trying a bunch of them. You never know, you might end up being one of the first few folks to play the next Balatro, Manor Lords or Deep Rock Galactic Survivor.New releasesAbsolum is a beat-'em-up from the folks behind Streets of Rage 4. It's the first original IP from Dotemu, which has found success with the likes of the terrific Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge. It co-developed this game with Guard Crush Games and Supamonks. The art and animation from the latter looks absolutely divine. You can play Absolum solo or with a friend. Since it's a roguelite, you'll gain upgrades to bolster your character on each run while earning experience that goes toward permanent progression. There are multiple paths to explore, so the replayability factor seems strong here. Engadget senior reporter Igor Bonifacic spent some time with Absolum this summer and was impressed by it. The game received strong reviews this week too.Absolum is out now on Steam, Nintendo Switch, PS4 and PS5. Dotemu also has another beat-'em-up, Marvel Cosmic Invasion, coming soon.A few reviews I've read for Bye Sweet Carole (which are fairly mixed) dinged it for having clunky controls and some other quality-of-life problems, such as getting softlocked while trying to complete puzzles. I hope Little Sewing Machine can iron out those issues since the presentation of this game is quite something. It looks like an early-'90s animated movie, with hand-drawn animations and, seemingly, a soundtrack to match. Bye Sweet Carole is a 2D horror-platformer from publisher Maximum Entertainment in which you play as a young girl trying to find her best friend, who disappeared from an orphanage. It's out now on PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch and Xbox Series X/S.Want to see another new game with a unique look that makes it stand out from the crowd? Of course you do. Exploration action game Dreams of Another — which landed on PS5, PS VR2 and Steam this week — sees you creating the environment in a dream-like world by shooting at it. Director Baiyon (PixelJunk Eden) and the team at Q-Games used point cloud rendering technology to create the unusual, but captivating visuals. Dunno why they felt the need to put a clown in this game though. Clowns are rotten things.Dreams of Another arrived on the same day that Q-Games' PixelJunk Eden 2 hit PS4, PS5 and Steam (it's coming to Epic Games Store as well). That game debuted on Nintendo Switch in 2020.Here's yet another lovely-looking project, and this time it's a pixel-art game from Teenage Astronauts and publisher No More Robots. In Little Rocket Lab, you play as aspiring engineer Morgan, who sets out to build factories with the aim of achieving her family's dream of making a rocket ship. It’s more build a rocket, girl, than Build A Rocket Boy.This is a blend of a factory builder and life sim, and it looks rather charming. Little Rocket Lab has touched down on Steam and Xbox. It's on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. On the subject of pixel-art games, I couldn't not include one that came out this week from a developer based in my hometown. Cairn: Mathair’s Curse is a turn-based RPG. It's set in the early 2000s in the Scottish Highlands and it sees a young lad and his mates dealing with the aftermath of a cult casting an ancient curse on their home. Solo developer Ross McRitchie spent five years making Cairn: Mathair’s Curse and his partner, Christine, composed the Celtic soundtrack. It's said to have plenty of Scottish humor, which speaks to me. The game, which Steam reviews have likened to EarthBound, is out on Steam now.Upcoming I'm looking forward to checking out Blackwood, which is slated to hit Steam in the second half of 2026. It has a pretty great pitch:By day, you run a DVD store in 2012 New York. By night, you’re a ruthless assassin. Blackwood is a cinematic third-person shooter with grounded melee combat, brutal takedowns, responsive gunplay and a double life to manage.The facial animations look a little rough in the reveal trailer, but it's alpha footage and there's plenty of time to polish it. I'm hoping the team at Bangladesh-based AttritoM7 Productions manages to do that, because otherwise this game is looking quite nifty with its John Wick-style combat.I do love a game with a great name, and I've got a couple to tell you about. Action RPG Bittersweet Birthday has hand-drawn pixel art and nothing but boss battles when it comes to combat. Bittersweet Birthday — from World Eater Games and publisher Dangen Entertainment — is set to land on Steam, GOG, Humble and Itch on November 11. It's coming to consoles later.Here’s a pinball-themed precision platformer in the mold of games like Baby Steps and Getting Over It. Fittingly, it's called A Pinball Game That Makes You Mad and you can control it with a single button.There’s no release date as yet for this project from Azimuth Studios. However, a demo is available on Steam now. Like a good teenage cousin, it's fun and annoying in equal measure.Another pre-Next Fest demo I've had a chance to check out is for Don't Stop, Girlypop!, a fast-paced arena shooter with an anti-capitalist bent. I've been looking forward to this one since I found out about it late last year. The demo, with its Y2K girly-pop aesthetics and Doom Eternal/Ultrakill-style gameplay, does not disappoint. I'm glad the team trimmed the first word from the original name — Incolatus: Don't Stop, Girlypop! — since the shorter version is much punchier and more memorable. Funny Fintan Softworks and publisher Kwalee haven't revealed a release date as yet, but I'll be checking my T9 flip phone impatiently in the meantime.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/stylish-beat-em-ups-platformers-and-rpgs-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-110000184.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Proton VPN stands out for two main reasons: it's one of the only virtual private networks (VPNs) to include a free plan with no data limits, and it's one of the few services majority-owned by a nonprofit. It's the best VPN in both of those categories, and it makes a strong case for being the best overall. Even if you don't care about the work of the Proton Foundation, Proton VPN is a service worth using. It's easy to install and manage, runs like the wind and meets high standards for security and privacy. It has more IP locations in Africa than any of its competitors. It's even looking toward the future by working toward full IPv6 support. In short, Proton VPN gets our enthusiastic recommendation, especially for torrenting (which it supports on almost every server). It's not perfect — the apps for Apple systems lag behind their Windows and Android counterparts, and the free servers can be noticeably sluggish — but the cons pale in comparison to the pros. We'll get into it all below. Editor's note (9/24/25): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews.

As a rule, it's not difficult. Proton VPN has more features than ExpressVPN, and a couple of them might trip up new users, but you'd have to really scrounge to find an actual inconvenience to complain about. Windows Proton VPN installs easily on Windows — you'll need to grant it permission to make changes, but that's it. Once you've signed in on the app, you'll reach one of the best interfaces we've tried on a VPN. The server network is immediately visible as both a list and map, and the location search bar, connect button and major features are all laid out around the same window. Proton VPN's app for Windows.Sam Chapman for Engadget It's honestly amazing how much you can reach from the launch window without anything feeling cluttered. They even squeezed in keyboard shortcuts for the search field. We also love that settings open in the same window, since dealing with both the main VPN app and a separate preferences panel can get annoying. Our only real gripe is that there should be an easier way to adjust the size of the map. Mac The desktop app for Mac isn't quite as deftly laid out as the Windows app. You can reach most of the important features from the main window, including Profiles, NetShield, Secure Core servers and the kill switch. However, there's no longer a way to filter out a list of the P2P or Tor servers, except by digging through the Profile controls. On the plus side, you can adjust the size of the map, so it's now a viable alternative to the server list. Proton VPN's dark mode interface on macOS.Sam Chapman for Engadget The other preferences are hidden in the menu bar — go to Proton VPN > Settings to reach them. They're laid out in four tabs, and shouldn't take more than a minute to go through at setup. Android The Android app takes the same design cues as the Windows app, and works as well. Four tabs along the bottom switch between the home screen, the country list, Profiles and all other settings. You can search the list of countries by tapping the magnifying glass at the top-right. In another nice touch, tapping the dots by any virtual location will tell you where the server is physically located. Proton VPN's Android client.Sam Chapman for Engadget Android users get some nifty exclusive Profiles, including \"anti-censorship,\" which automatically connects to the fastest country except for the one you're in. The Settings tab is a single menu with subheadings and no unnecessary complication. iOS Proton VPN for iPhone and iPad looks almost the same as it does on Windows and Android, but with some of the same drawbacks found on Mac. The server list is more cluttered, and once again there's no easy way to sift out the P2P and Tor locations. Proton VPN's app for iPhone and iPad.Sam Chapman for Engadget The Settings tab puts all the feature descriptions in the open, which makes it look denser than it is. But these are minor quibbles — this is still a VPN that's very easy to activate and forget about. Browser extensions Proton VPN has browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox. These serve as de facto split tunneling, as connecting through the extension protects only browser traffic; everything else goes unprotected. You can split the tunnel further by setting the VPN to not work on certain URLs (unlike the other apps, you don't need to know the IPs of those sites). Proton VPN speed test: Impacts of VPN Accelerator We used Ookla's Speedtest app to determine how much Proton VPN drags on a user's latency, measured in milliseconds (ms), and download and upload speeds, measured in megabits per second (Mbps). Together, these three stats show whether a VPN will noticeably slow down your internet, especially during demanding tasks. We had high hopes for Proton here because of its VPN Accelerator technology, which runs VPN communications across several parallel tracks to process everything faster. It didn't disappoint — for the most part. Although download speeds didn't reach the heights we saw from ExpressVPN, Proton VPN's browsing performance still looks excellent nearly across the board. Proton VPN barely makes a dent in your download speeds.Sam Chapman for Engadget To choose our locations for the test, we checked Proton VPN's list of smart routing servers, which use servers in one country to simulate IP addresses in another. Almost all the smart routing servers are based in five cities: Miami, London, Marseille, Bucharest and Singapore. We ran these tests on a Mac using the automatic protocol setting. Server LocationLatency (ms)Increase factorDownload speed (Mbps)Percentage dropUpload speed (Mbps)Percentage dropPortland, OR, USA (unprotected)16--58.93--5.82--San Jose, CA, USA (best server)523.3x55.8255.584Miami, FL, USA16010x54.3385.496London, UK33220.8x52.55115.722Marseille, France30919.3x45.42235.594Bucharest, Romania40825.5x52.51115.574Singapore, Singapore39424.6x52.26115.505Average27617.3x52.15125.584 Proton VPN looks very good in that table. Its average download speed was 88 percent of our unprotected speeds. To put that in perspective, if you started with 30 Mbps down (about half what we get) and connected to any Proton VPN server, you'd almost certainly still have a fast enough connection to stream in 4K. Note the \"almost\" — Proton VPN did drop noticeably on its French server in Marseille. It's not uncommon for one of a VPN's data centers to have trouble while the others work fine, and you can usually fix the problem by just disconnecting and reconnecting. Just note that while drops to about 75 percent of your download speed are rare, they're not inconceivable. Proton VPN security test: Watertight protocols When we talk about VPN security, we're really talking about reliability. Can this VPN establish an encrypted tunnel and transmit all your information through it, every time, without leaks or failures? With Proton VPN, we're happy to say the answer is yes; we probed its security and found no cracks to speak of. Read the section below for specifics. Proton VPN protocols: WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2 and Stealth Proton VPN uses four VPN protocols to communicate between your devices, its servers and the internet. Three of them (WireGuard, OpenVPN and IKEv2) are common choices with no serious flaws as long as they're implemented thoughtfully. The fourth, Stealth, is an obfuscation protocol you should only use if the other three are blocked. The protocol selection screen on Proton VPN's Android app.Sam Chapman for Engadget OpenVPN is the most secure option. Without getting too technical, OpenVPN encrypts its backend functions as well as the data itself, which leaves it with no obvious vulnerabilities. It can also communicate using the same ports as common HTTPS traffic, so it's hard to block. WireGuard is more efficient than OpenVPN, both in its source code and the cryptography it uses. It normally requires an exchange of fixed IP addresses, but the Proton VPN implementation overwrites those IPs with randomized addresses, cutting the security risk. IKEv2 is a safe choice that's occasionally faster than either OpenVPN or WireGuard. You probably won't use it unless it happens to come up while you've set the protocol to Smart. As such, it's on the way to being phased out of Proton VPN. Stealth is unique to Proton VPN, though its function is not. It's got the same architecture as WireGuard, but adds another TLS tunnel to evade network blocks that catch VPN traffic. That extra encryption slows it down, so we don't recommend using it unless the other three protocols don't work. The first option on the app, called \"Smart,\" is not a protocol — it means your VPN client selects the protocol that will give you the best speeds on your current server. Since all four protocols are safe, there's no downside to using the Smart setting most of the time. Leak test We used AirVPN's IP leak tool to check all four of Proton VPN's protocols for DNS and WebRTC leaks. Proton VPN uses its own DNS servers to reduce the risk of sending unencrypted requests, but since leaks are still possible, we tested using a simple method: checking our visible IP address before and after connecting to the VPN. Despite testing several locations over three days, we never saw our real IP address show up on the tool. This held true even outside the Secure Core server list, where data centers might have been managed by third parties. It's not perfect proof, but it's a very good sign that Proton VPN enforces a consistent security regime on all its servers. Proton VPN successfully masked our real IP address, even on a virtual location in Angola.Sam Chapman for Engadget We also used BrowserLeaks to check for WebRTC leaks. These are mainly an issue on the browser side, but a VPN is doubly important if your browser happens to be leaking. We enabled WebRTC on our browser and tested the same set of Proton VPN servers without springing any WebRTC leaks. Proton VPN and IPv6 Proton is working on making its entire VPN compatible with IPv6 addresses. If a VPN that's only configured for IPv4 has to resolve an IPv6 address, it can cause a leak — that's why most VPNs, even the best ones, block IPv6 altogether. That said, the whole internet will run on IPv6 one day, so it's nice to see Proton VPN leading the pack. So far, IPv6 is automatically enabled on Proton VPN's Linux apps and browser extensions, and can be optionally activated on its Android app. The Proton VPN apps for all other platforms still block IPv6 traffic, but this should hopefully change soon. Encryption test Even if a VPN's protocol choices are solid, it's possible for individual implementations of those protocols to fail. We used WireShark, a packet inspector app, to test whether Proton VPN's encryption worked no matter what settings were in place. We're happy to say we never saw plaintext once. How much does Proton VPN cost? To get full access to Proton VPN, you'll need a Plus subscription, which costs $9.99 per month. You can knock off half that price by subscribing for a full year and paying a lump sum of $59.88, working out to $4.99 per month. A Plus account with Proton VPN also gives you free access to every other Proton app. You can also pay $107.76 in advance to subscribe for two years, an average of $4.49 per month — perhaps more convenient, but it doesn't save you much. The one-year plan is the best value, though it's also nice that you don't have to pay through the nose for only one month. There's a 30-day, money-back guarantee on all plans. Proton VPN is currently offering Engadget readers an exclusive deal that offers a 12-month plan for $47.88 ($3.99 per month) and a 24-month plan for $81.36 ($3.39 per month). Learn more about it here. One final option is the Proton Unlimited subscription, discussed in the \"side apps and bundles\" section below.\" The Proton VPN free plan Proton VPN is one of the best free VPNs on the market right now. No other VPN backed by as much experience and good judgment has a free plan with no data limits. Instead of capping how much data you can use per month, Proton VPN restricts which servers free users can access, limiting them to eight countries: the United States, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Norway, Canada, Poland and Romania. The frustrating part is that you can't choose which of these servers you use; Proton VPN just auto-connects to whichever one is the least burdened. A Proton representative told us that this change goes along with improvements to the selection algorithm, better load balancing and the addition of the Poland and Romania locations. It is also possible to try for a better connection by clicking \"change server.\" The fact remains, though, that a free Proton VPN plan is useless for unblocking content in specific locations — but this may be by design. The free plan seems more aimed toward privacy and anonymity than streaming, and the placement of the free locations near Russia and China reflects that. Free Proton VPN plans don't sacrifice any essential security features. Proton VPN side apps and bundles Proton VPN's main bundle is Proton Unlimited, which gets you all six Proton products in one package: VPN, Mail, Drive, Calendar, Wallet and Pass. This costs $12.99 for a month, $119.88 for a year ($9.99 per month) and $191.76 for two years ($7.99 per month). We won't be going in-depth on any of them in this review, but here's a quick rundown of each. Proton Mail: An end-to-end encrypted email service. Proton can still see a Mail user's real IP address, but can't read any of their messages. Proton Drive: Encrypted cloud storage. As with Mail, Proton can identify users, but can't read any of the content they store. Proton Calendar: An encrypted scheduling app with events and reminders. Proton Wallet: A self-custody wallet for storing Bitcoin unconnected to any exchange. Proton Pass: A password manager that generates, stores and autofills passwords for online accounts. Even if you only need two of the six, Proton Unlimited saves you money. Separate monthly subscriptions to Proton VPN and Proton Mail would cost a total of $14.98, so you've already knocked off $2 per month. That increases if you're able to commit to a year in advance. Close-reading Proton VPN's privacy policy Proton's privacy policy comes in two parts: the general Proton policy and the shorter policy specific to Proton VPN. We'll cover them in that order. General Proton privacy policy Proton tracks user activity on its product websites using its own marketing tools; the data set collected does not include IP addresses. It retains an email address connected to each user's account, but it's not allowed to connect IP addresses (and thus identities and locations) to those emails unless the user breaches the terms of service. You may rightly ask how Proton would know a user is abusing one of their services if they don't keep activity logs. The answer is that logs aren't needed; most forms of abuse can be detected in other ways and observed in real time. For example, if someone used a Proton VPN server to launch a DDoS attack, the team could inspect that server and find the hacker while the attack was still ongoing. The policy goes on to list the five third-party data processors Proton uses (Zendesk, PayPal, Chargebee, Atlassian and Stripe), none of whom are allowed to store customer activity data. Proton cautions that it will share what data it does have in response to unblockable requests from the Swiss government, but not \"until all legal or other remedies have been exhausted.\" This is standard for a VPN that wants to remain in business, and the transparency report shows the company does indeed fight court orders when it can. Proton VPN privacy policy Proton's VPN-specific privacy policy is quite short. It states that Proton cannot log user activities or identifiable characteristics of devices connected to the VPN, cannot throttle internet connections and must extend full privacy and security to free users. In one sense, a privacy policy requires you to take the VPN provider at their word, but it's dangerous for a company to make promises they don't intend to keep. The policy is legally binding, and breaking it is grounds for a lawsuit. Proton VPN's succinct no-logs policy is therefore a great sign. It's also been confirmed several times by a third-party audit, most recently in July 2024. Can Proton VPN change your virtual location? Testing a VPN's ability to mask a user's location isn't complex — all you need is a streaming subscription. We connected to five test locations and tried to unblock Netflix with each one. If we managed to access the site, and saw different shows than those on the American library, we concluded that the location had masked us successfully. Server locationUnblocked Netflix?Library changed?CanadaYYRomaniaYYGhanaYYJapanYYNew ZealandYY Proton VPN passed the test every time in all five locations. The only hiccup came in Romania, which we chose because it's one of the free locations. The app connected us to a free server, which was too slow to load Netflix; when we chose a paid server, the problem disappeared. Proton VPN changed our virtual location so we saw the Japanese Netflix library.Sam Chapman for Engadget Investigating Proton VPN's server network Proton VPN's free plan includes servers in five locations: the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, the United States and Japan. When you connect as a free user, you'll be automatically connected to whichever location is fastest. A paid plan opens up the full network of 154 servers in 117 countries and territories. The menu includes a huge selection of African locations, more than any VPN we've tested in some time. The Middle East, along with central and southern Asia, are also well represented, and U.S. users will find 20 different locations to choose from. Proton VPN lets you know which of its locations are virtual.Sam Chapman for Engadget Keep in mind that about two-thirds of these server locations are virtual, meaning they're not physically located where they claim to be. This includes all the African servers except South Africa and Nigeria; all the South American servers except Brazil, Colombia and Argentina; and all the Middle Eastern servers except Turkey, Israel and the UAE. A majority of the locations in Asia are also virtual, including South Korea, India, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. To be clear, virtual locations can hide your IP address just as well as physical ones. It's only a problem if you're expecting the kind of performance, particularly in terms of latency, that you get from a nearby server. Luckily, Proton VPN gives you fast enough download and upload speeds that distance shouldn't be a problem.

We've already mentioned the Stealth protocol and IPv6 support. In this section, we'll cover an additional five features that might be of interest. NetShield ad blocker Proton VPN's built-in ad blocker is known as NetShield. It's available on the main UI page, and has two settings: one that blocks only malware sites, and one that blocks sites connected with malware, ads and trackers. The stronger feature is on by default. The Netshield page on Proton VPN's iOS app.Sam Chapman for Engadget NetShield works by checking any DNS requests against a database of web servers known to host malware, inject ads or attach cross-site trackers to your browsing session. The DNS-blocking approach means it's not capable of blocking ads served from the same domain that hosts them — so no blocking YouTube video ads. On the positive side, it means NetShield works across your entire device, not just on your browser. NetShield also displays a running total of how many of each form of interference it's blocked. It catches most banner ads, but since you can't customize the blocklist in any way, it's best when combined with another browser-level ad blocker. Secure Core servers Here's an interesting one. Secure Core is a form of a common feature known as double VPN or multi-hop VPN, in which a connection runs through two VPN servers before being decrypted. If one server fails or gets compromised, the other server keeps your connection private. Secure Core servers add a second node to your VPN connection.Sam Chapman for Engadget Proton VPN takes this a step further. When you activate Secure Core, your connection will still end at your chosen server location — but before that, it will travel through a designated server in Iceland, Sweden or Switzerland. A few touches make Secure Core servers more reliable than the average VPN node: All three countries are safe jurisdictions, with consumer-friendly privacy laws and courts sympathetic to privacy claims. Secure Core data centers are locked down physically; for example, the Iceland location is a refitted military base, and the Sweden location is literally underground. Proton owns and operates all Secure Core locations itself, with no rentals or third-party managers. Almost no other VPNs pay as much attention to physical security as Proton VPN does with this feature. The second hop makes Secure Core connections slower on average, but it's worth it if you have something especially sensitive to do online. Kill switch Proton VPN includes a kill switch, a standard feature. When active, a kill switch cuts off your internet whenever your connection to the VPN drops. This means you're never in danger of leaking your real identity or location, even for a second. It also protects you against the TunnelVision exploit, which requires the hacker to make a fake VPN server. Split tunneling Split tunneling is included on the Windows and Android apps, but users on other devices can access it through the browser extension. With split tunneling, some apps or websites get online through the VPN, while others stay unprotected. Split tunneling with Proton VPN on Android.Sam Chapman for Engadget Proton VPN allows split tunneling by both app and IP address. This grants you a precise level of control over your split, as long as you know the IP of each website you're placing on the list (you can find that out using DNS checker). Torrenting servers and port forwarding Proton VPN is one of the best VPNs for torrenting. It restricts torrenting to P2P servers, but nearly every server on the list is a P2P server — only Secure Core servers and some free servers don't permit torrenting. Combine that with the fact that it maintains 96 percent of your upload speeds on average, and you should have few problems using a torrenting client. Proton VPN's list of P2P servers.Sam Chapman for Engadget It also has some support for port forwarding, which can improve torrenting speed. Windows and Linux users can enable it with a simple toggle, which provides an active port number for configuring private servers. Mac users can set up port forwarding through manual OpenVPN or WireGuard configurations. Tor over VPN A handful of Proton VPN servers route you directly to the Tor network after encrypting your connection. While connected to one of these Tor over VPN servers, which are marked with TOR in their names and an onion symbol, you'll be able to open .onion links on a normal browser. This is more than just convenient — Tor over VPN is the safest way to access the dark web. With the VPN as an intermediary, you're never connecting to Tor with your own IP address, so malicious node operators can't see your real identity. For maximum privacy, use Tor Browser to create your Proton VPN account, so you're never exposed at any point in the process. Proton VPN has Tor servers in six countries (the U.S., France, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and Hong Kong). Each just has one Tor server, except the United States, which gets two. Tor over VPN is supported on all platforms, but it won't work on Mac or iOS unless you have the kill switch enabled. Profiles A \"profile\" on Proton VPN is a group of pre-established settings you can use to quickly configure the VPN for a particular task. Two profiles are available from the start: Fastest, which connects to the fastest server, and Random, which always connects to a different server. You can create more profiles by toggling four settings: Feature: The type of server used. Choose from Standard, Secure Core, P2P or Tor over VPN. Country: The country to which the profile connects. Server: A server within that country. You can also select \"fastest\" or \"random.\" Protocol: Which VPN protocol the profile will use. \"Smart\" can be selected. As an example, say you want to watch a TV series that's only available on Netflix in Canada. You could create a profile called \"Netflix Canada\" that connects to the fastest Canadian server with just one click. We'd call profiles situationally useful, but they can save a lot of time if you regularly perform the same action on your VPN. Proton VPN customer support options We went to Proton VPN's FAQ pages with two questions that came up while researching other sections: which of Proton VPN's servers are managed by third parties, and why do certain server locations (like Marseilles) run slow despite the app showing a light load? You can access the help center through any of Proton VPN's apps, or by going directly to the website. Articles appear to be organized into six categories. Oddly, clicking any category button only shows you a handful of the articles in that section — for example, the Troubleshooting category looks like it only has five articles. If you type \"troubleshooting\" into the search bar, though, you'll see dozens pop up. There are even some sections, like Billing, that don't appear on the main page at all. It has the feel of a website update that wasn't adequately brought in line with the bulk of the support content. Until Proton fixes it, just use the search bar for everything. The articles themselves are well-written, give or take some stilted English. Getting quick help We couldn't find written answers to our questions about ownership and server load, so we turned to live chat. Free users should keep in mind that live chat support is only available on paid accounts, but there's a fairly active subreddit at r/protonvpn where Proton staff frequently post. Live chat is not intuitively located on protonvpn.com. We finally found it by scrolling all the way to the bottom of the main page, only to be told nobody was online to help at the moment — live chat is only accessible from 9 AM to midnight Central European Time (CET). We submitted our question about the Marseille servers as an email ticket instead. Sam Chapman for Engadget This part was easy, at least, as the form helpfully populated our system information. We also got a prompt response within 24 hours. We ended the interaction there, as we weren't able to reproduce the sluggish behavior on the French server locations, but it's nice to know the team will answer quickly. Proton VPN background check: The CERN origins of Proton AG Proton VPN launched in 2017, but its team's experience goes back much farther. The founders of its parent company, Proton AG, met while working at CERN in Switzerland, and the company remains under Swiss jurisdiction. Their first product, Proton Mail, went live in 2014 after a successful crowdfunding campaign, and claims to have 100 million users today. Proton VPN was Proton AG's second project. Like Proton Mail, it consists of a free plan supplemented by paid upgrades. Since then, Proton has introduced several more products: Proton Calendar in 2020, Proton Drive cloud storage in 2022 and the Proton Pass password manager in 2023, each designed around using end-to-end encryption to make user data inaccessible. The Proton Foundation Proton announced in 2024 that the majority of its shares had been acquired by the Proton Foundation, a nonprofit whose only purpose is to control Proton stock. Among other benefits, this prevents it from being purchased by anyone who disagrees with its mission. To sell to an objectionable parent company, the entire board of trustees would have to agree, which feels unlikely based on Proton's track record. Throughout Proton's history, we only found two incidents serious enough to comment on, and only one of them concerned Proton VPN. We'll cover them both below. ProtonMail law enforcement collaboration allegations On the page that hosts its annual transparency report, Proton states openly that it \"may be legally compelled to disclose certain user information to Swiss authorities\" (see the Privacy Policy section of this article for more on precisely what information that describes). In 2021, the company admitted it had given Swiss police (acting on a French warrant) a ProtonMail user's IP address and device logs. The police arrested the user, a French environmental activist. While that's unnerving for privacy-minded users, there are some important contextual issues to consider. Most importantly, ProtonMail is not governed by the same policy as Proton VPN. At the time the case unfolded, Swiss law obliged all email companies to comply with court orders from Swiss authorities to hand over data. VPNs aren't subject to those retention requirements. Today, Swiss email companies have been reclassified so they're also exempt from data retention requirements, thanks in part to a policy change Proton fought for. A representative from Proton confirmed that \"under Swiss law, we are not obligated to save any user connection logs.\" It's also reassuring that, despite complying with the subpoena, Proton wasn't able to turn over the contents of any emails. Alleged WireGuard memory vulnerability In January 2025, researchers at Venak Security alleged that Proton VPN lacks memory protection for keys generated under the WireGuard protocol, which might let hackers scrape the keys and decrypt intercepted communications. Proton responded to Venak in a blog post, which a Proton representative confirmed remains their official response to the allegations. In short: the Venak article only demonstrates that it's possible to view public keys, not private ones. This isn't much of a bombshell, given that \"public\" is right there in the name. But asymmetric encryption — the kind used by VPN protocols like WireGuard — requires both keys to decrypt any messages. Even if a hacker were able to get ahold of a private key, they likely wouldn't be able to use it for anything. WireGuard incorporates perfect forward secrecy by default, changing session keys often enough that any given key is obsolete by the time it's stolen. Final verdict In short, we're prepared to recommend Proton VPN to almost anybody. Whether you're mainly concerned with security, streaming or something else, chances are good that you'll be satisfied. The only serious downsides are that the long-term plans are overpriced and that it's hard to get live tech support if you live outside of Europe. It's also our unqualified pick for the best free VPN, but with the caveat that it's a bad choice for anyone who needs to choose specific server locations. If all you care about is staying hidden from your ISP and advertisers, Proton should be your first choice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Proton VPN stands out for two main reasons: it's one of the only virtual private networks (VPNs) to include a free plan with no data limits, and it's one of the few services majority-owned by a nonprofit. It's the best VPN in both of those categories, and it makes a strong case for being the best overall. Even if you don't care about the work of the Proton Foundation, Proton VPN is a service worth using. It's easy to install and manage, runs like the wind and meets high standards for security and privacy. It has more IP locations in Africa than any of its competitors. It's even looking toward the future by working toward full IPv6 support. In short, Proton VPN gets our enthusiastic recommendation, especially for torrenting (which it supports on almost every server). It's not perfect — the apps for Apple systems lag behind their Windows and Android counterparts, and the free servers can be noticeably sluggish — but the cons pale in comparison to the pros. We'll get into it all below. Editor's note (9/24/25): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews. Check out how we test VPNs to learn more about the new standards we're using.

As a rule, it's not difficult. Proton VPN has more features than ExpressVPN, and a couple of them might trip up new users, but you'd have to really scrounge to find an actual inconvenience to complain about. Windows Proton VPN installs easily on Windows — you'll need to grant it permission to make changes, but that's it. Once you've signed in on the app, you'll reach one of the best interfaces we've tried on a VPN. The server network is immediately visible as both a list and map, and the location search bar, connect button and major features are all laid out around the same window. Proton VPN's app for Windows.Sam Chapman for Engadget It's honestly amazing how much you can reach from the launch window without anything feeling cluttered. They even squeezed in keyboard shortcuts for the search field. We also love that settings open in the same window, since dealing with both the main VPN app and a separate preferences panel can get annoying. Our only real gripe is that there should be an easier way to adjust the size of the map. Mac The desktop app for Mac isn't quite as deftly laid out as the Windows app. You can reach most of the important features from the main window, including Profiles, NetShield, Secure Core servers and the kill switch. However, there's no longer a way to filter out a list of the P2P or Tor servers, except by digging through the Profile controls. On the plus side, you can adjust the size of the map, so it's now a viable alternative to the server list. Proton VPN's dark mode interface on macOS.Sam Chapman for Engadget The other preferences are hidden in the menu bar — go to Proton VPN > Settings to reach them. They're laid out in four tabs, and shouldn't take more than a minute to go through at setup. Android The Android app takes the same design cues as the Windows app, and works as well. Four tabs along the bottom switch between the home screen, the country list, Profiles and all other settings. You can search the list of countries by tapping the magnifying glass at the top-right. In another nice touch, tapping the dots by any virtual location will tell you where the server is physically located. Proton VPN's Android client.Sam Chapman for Engadget Android users get some nifty exclusive Profiles, including \"anti-censorship,\" which automatically connects to the fastest country except for the one you're in. The Settings tab is a single menu with subheadings and no unnecessary complication. iOS Proton VPN for iPhone and iPad looks almost the same as it does on Windows and Android, but with some of the same drawbacks found on Mac. The server list is more cluttered, and once again there's no easy way to sift out the P2P and Tor locations. Proton VPN's app for iPhone and iPad.Sam Chapman for Engadget The Settings tab puts all the feature descriptions in the open, which makes it look denser than it is. But these are minor quibbles — this is still a VPN that's very easy to activate and forget about. Browser extensions Proton VPN has browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox. These serve as de facto split tunneling, as connecting through the extension protects only browser traffic; everything else goes unprotected. You can split the tunnel further by setting the VPN to not work on certain URLs (unlike the other apps, you don't need to know the IPs of those sites). Proton VPN speed test: Impacts of VPN Accelerator We used Ookla's Speedtest app to determine how much Proton VPN drags on a user's latency, measured in milliseconds (ms), and download and upload speeds, measured in megabits per second (Mbps). Together, these three stats show whether a VPN will noticeably slow down your internet, especially during demanding tasks. We had high hopes for Proton here because of its VPN Accelerator technology, which runs VPN communications across several parallel tracks to process everything faster. It didn't disappoint — for the most part. Although download speeds didn't reach the heights we saw from ExpressVPN, Proton VPN's browsing performance still looks excellent nearly across the board. Proton VPN barely makes a dent in your download speeds.Sam Chapman for Engadget To choose our locations for the test, we checked Proton VPN's list of smart routing servers, which use servers in one country to simulate IP addresses in another. Almost all the smart routing servers are based in five cities: Miami, London, Marseille, Bucharest and Singapore. We ran these tests on a Mac using the automatic protocol setting. Server LocationLatency (ms)Increase factorDownload speed (Mbps)Percentage dropUpload speed (Mbps)Percentage dropPortland, OR, USA (unprotected)16--58.93--5.82--San Jose, CA, USA (best server)523.3x55.8255.584Miami, FL, USA16010x54.3385.496London, UK33220.8x52.55115.722Marseille, France30919.3x45.42235.594Bucharest, Romania40825.5x52.51115.574Singapore, Singapore39424.6x52.26115.505Average27617.3x52.15125.584 Proton VPN looks very good in that table. Its average download speed was 88 percent of our unprotected speeds. To put that in perspective, if you started with 30 Mbps down (about half what we get) and connected to any Proton VPN server, you'd almost certainly still have a fast enough connection to stream in 4K. Note the \"almost\" — Proton VPN did drop noticeably on its French server in Marseille. It's not uncommon for one of a VPN's data centers to have trouble while the others work fine, and you can usually fix the problem by just disconnecting and reconnecting. Just note that while drops to about 75 percent of your download speed are rare, they're not inconceivable. Proton VPN security test: Watertight protocols When we talk about VPN security, we're really talking about reliability. Can this VPN establish an encrypted tunnel and transmit all your information through it, every time, without leaks or failures? With Proton VPN, we're happy to say the answer is yes; we probed its security and found no cracks to speak of. Read the section below for specifics. Proton VPN protocols: WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2 and Stealth Proton VPN uses four VPN protocols to communicate between your devices, its servers and the internet. Three of them (WireGuard, OpenVPN and IKEv2) are common choices with no serious flaws as long as they're implemented thoughtfully. The fourth, Stealth, is an obfuscation protocol you should only use if the other three are blocked. The protocol selection screen on Proton VPN's Android app.Sam Chapman for Engadget OpenVPN is the most secure option. Without getting too technical, OpenVPN encrypts its backend functions as well as the data itself, which leaves it with no obvious vulnerabilities. It can also communicate using the same ports as common HTTPS traffic, so it's hard to block. WireGuard is more efficient than OpenVPN, both in its source code and the cryptography it uses. It normally requires an exchange of fixed IP addresses, but the Proton VPN implementation overwrites those IPs with randomized addresses, cutting the security risk. IKEv2 is a safe choice that's occasionally faster than either OpenVPN or WireGuard. You probably won't use it unless it happens to come up while you've set the protocol to Smart. As such, it's on the way to being phased out of Proton VPN. Stealth is unique to Proton VPN, though its function is not. It's got the same architecture as WireGuard, but adds another TLS tunnel to evade network blocks that catch VPN traffic. That extra encryption slows it down, so we don't recommend using it unless the other three protocols don't work. The first option on the app, called \"Smart,\" is not a protocol — it means your VPN client selects the protocol that will give you the best speeds on your current server. Since all four protocols are safe, there's no downside to using the Smart setting most of the time. Leak test We used AirVPN's IP leak tool to check all four of Proton VPN's protocols for DNS and WebRTC leaks. Proton VPN uses its own DNS servers to reduce the risk of sending unencrypted requests, but since leaks are still possible, we tested using a simple method: checking our visible IP address before and after connecting to the VPN. Despite testing several locations over three days, we never saw our real IP address show up on the tool. This held true even outside the Secure Core server list, where data centers might have been managed by third parties. It's not perfect proof, but it's a very good sign that Proton VPN enforces a consistent security regime on all its servers. Proton VPN successfully masked our real IP address, even on a virtual location in Angola.Sam Chapman for Engadget We also used BrowserLeaks to check for WebRTC leaks. These are mainly an issue on the browser side, but a VPN is doubly important if your browser happens to be leaking. We enabled WebRTC on our browser and tested the same set of Proton VPN servers without springing any WebRTC leaks. Proton VPN and IPv6 Proton is working on making its entire VPN compatible with IPv6 addresses. If a VPN that's only configured for IPv4 has to resolve an IPv6 address, it can cause a leak — that's why most VPNs, even the best ones, block IPv6 altogether. That said, the whole internet will run on IPv6 one day, so it's nice to see Proton VPN leading the pack. So far, IPv6 is automatically enabled on Proton VPN's Linux apps and browser extensions, and can be optionally activated on its Android app. The Proton VPN apps for all other platforms still block IPv6 traffic, but this should hopefully change soon. Encryption test Even if a VPN's protocol choices are solid, it's possible for individual implementations of those protocols to fail. We used WireShark, a packet inspector app, to test whether Proton VPN's encryption worked no matter what settings were in place. We're happy to say we never saw plaintext once. How much does Proton VPN cost? To get full access to Proton VPN, you'll need a Plus subscription, which costs $9.99 per month. You can knock off half that price by subscribing for a full year and paying a lump sum of $59.88, working out to $4.99 per month. A Plus account with Proton VPN also gives you free access to every other Proton app. You can also pay $107.76 in advance to subscribe for two years, an average of $4.49 per month — perhaps more convenient, but it doesn't save you much. The one-year plan is the best value, though it's also nice that you don't have to pay through the nose for only one month. There's a 30-day, money-back guarantee on all plans. Proton VPN is currently offering Engadget readers an exclusive deal that offers a 12-month plan for $47.88 ($3.99 per month) and a 24-month plan for $81.36 ($3.39 per month). Learn more about it here. One final option is the Proton Unlimited subscription, discussed in the \"side apps and bundles\" section below.\" The Proton VPN free plan Proton VPN is one of the best free VPNs on the market right now. No other VPN backed by as much experience and good judgment has a free plan with no data limits. Instead of capping how much data you can use per month, Proton VPN restricts which servers free users can access, limiting them to eight countries: the United States, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, Norway, Canada, Poland and Romania. The frustrating part is that you can't choose which of these servers you use; Proton VPN just auto-connects to whichever one is the least burdened. A Proton representative told us that this change goes along with improvements to the selection algorithm, better load balancing and the addition of the Poland and Romania locations. It is also possible to try for a better connection by clicking \"change server.\" The fact remains, though, that a free Proton VPN plan is useless for unblocking content in specific locations — but this may be by design. The free plan seems more aimed toward privacy and anonymity than streaming, and the placement of the free locations near Russia and China reflects that. Free Proton VPN plans don't sacrifice any essential security features. Proton VPN side apps and bundles Proton VPN's main bundle is Proton Unlimited, which gets you all six Proton products in one package: VPN, Mail, Drive, Calendar, Wallet and Pass. This costs $12.99 for a month, $119.88 for a year ($9.99 per month) and $191.76 for two years ($7.99 per month). We won't be going in-depth on any of them in this review, but here's a quick rundown of each. Proton Mail: An end-to-end encrypted email service. Proton can still see a Mail user's real IP address, but can't read any of their messages. Proton Drive: Encrypted cloud storage. As with Mail, Proton can identify users, but can't read any of the content they store. Proton Calendar: An encrypted scheduling app with events and reminders. Proton Wallet: A self-custody wallet for storing Bitcoin unconnected to any exchange. Proton Pass: A password manager that generates, stores and autofills passwords for online accounts. Even if you only need two of the six, Proton Unlimited saves you money. Separate monthly subscriptions to Proton VPN and Proton Mail would cost a total of $14.98, so you've already knocked off $2 per month. That increases if you're able to commit to a year in advance. Close-reading Proton VPN's privacy policy Proton's privacy policy comes in two parts: the general Proton policy and the shorter policy specific to Proton VPN. We'll cover them in that order. General Proton privacy policy Proton tracks user activity on its product websites using its own marketing tools; the data set collected does not include IP addresses. It retains an email address connected to each user's account, but it's not allowed to connect IP addresses (and thus identities and locations) to those emails unless the user breaches the terms of service. You may rightly ask how Proton would know a user is abusing one of their services if they don't keep activity logs. The answer is that logs aren't needed; most forms of abuse can be detected in other ways and observed in real time. For example, if someone used a Proton VPN server to launch a DDoS attack, the team could inspect that server and find the hacker while the attack was still ongoing. The policy goes on to list the five third-party data processors Proton uses (Zendesk, PayPal, Chargebee, Atlassian and Stripe), none of whom are allowed to store customer activity data. Proton cautions that it will share what data it does have in response to unblockable requests from the Swiss government, but not \"until all legal or other remedies have been exhausted.\" This is standard for a VPN that wants to remain in business, and the transparency report shows the company does indeed fight court orders when it can. Proton VPN privacy policy Proton's VPN-specific privacy policy is quite short. It states that Proton cannot log user activities or identifiable characteristics of devices connected to the VPN, cannot throttle internet connections and must extend full privacy and security to free users. In one sense, a privacy policy requires you to take the VPN provider at their word, but it's dangerous for a company to make promises they don't intend to keep. The policy is legally binding, and breaking it is grounds for a lawsuit. Proton VPN's succinct no-logs policy is therefore a great sign. It's also been confirmed several times by a third-party audit, most recently in July 2024. Can Proton VPN change your virtual location? Testing a VPN's ability to mask a user's location isn't complex — all you need is a streaming subscription. We connected to five test locations and tried to unblock Netflix with each one. If we managed to access the site, and saw different shows than those on the American library, we concluded that the location had masked us successfully. Server locationUnblocked Netflix?Library changed?CanadaYYRomaniaYYGhanaYYJapanYYNew ZealandYY Proton VPN passed the test every time in all five locations. The only hiccup came in Romania, which we chose because it's one of the free locations. The app connected us to a free server, which was too slow to load Netflix; when we chose a paid server, the problem disappeared. Proton VPN changed our virtual location so we saw the Japanese Netflix library.Sam Chapman for Engadget Investigating Proton VPN's server network Proton VPN's free plan includes servers in five locations: the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, the United States and Japan. When you connect as a free user, you'll be automatically connected to whichever location is fastest. A paid plan opens up the full network of 154 servers in 117 countries and territories. The menu includes a huge selection of African locations, more than any VPN we've tested in some time. The Middle East, along with central and southern Asia, are also well represented, and U.S. users will find 20 different locations to choose from. Proton VPN lets you know which of its locations are virtual.Sam Chapman for Engadget Keep in mind that about two-thirds of these server locations are virtual, meaning they're not physically located where they claim to be. This includes all the African servers except South Africa and Nigeria; all the South American servers except Brazil, Colombia and Argentina; and all the Middle Eastern servers except Turkey, Israel and the UAE. A majority of the locations in Asia are also virtual, including South Korea, India, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. To be clear, virtual locations can hide your IP address just as well as physical ones. It's only a problem if you're expecting the kind of performance, particularly in terms of latency, that you get from a nearby server. Luckily, Proton VPN gives you fast enough download and upload speeds that distance shouldn't be a problem.

We've already mentioned the Stealth protocol and IPv6 support. In this section, we'll cover an additional five features that might be of interest. NetShield ad blocker Proton VPN's built-in ad blocker is known as NetShield. It's available on the main UI page, and has two settings: one that blocks only malware sites, and one that blocks sites connected with malware, ads and trackers. The stronger feature is on by default. The Netshield page on Proton VPN's iOS app.Sam Chapman for Engadget NetShield works by checking any DNS requests against a database of web servers known to host malware, inject ads or attach cross-site trackers to your browsing session. The DNS-blocking approach means it's not capable of blocking ads served from the same domain that hosts them — so no blocking YouTube video ads. On the positive side, it means NetShield works across your entire device, not just on your browser. NetShield also displays a running total of how many of each form of interference it's blocked. It catches most banner ads, but since you can't customize the blocklist in any way, it's best when combined with another browser-level ad blocker. Secure Core servers Here's an interesting one. Secure Core is a form of a common feature known as double VPN or multi-hop VPN, in which a connection runs through two VPN servers before being decrypted. If one server fails or gets compromised, the other server keeps your connection private. Secure Core servers add a second node to your VPN connection.Sam Chapman for Engadget Proton VPN takes this a step further. When you activate Secure Core, your connection will still end at your chosen server location — but before that, it will travel through a designated server in Iceland, Sweden or Switzerland. A few touches make Secure Core servers more reliable than the average VPN node: All three countries are safe jurisdictions, with consumer-friendly privacy laws and courts sympathetic to privacy claims. Secure Core data centers are locked down physically; for example, the Iceland location is a refitted military base, and the Sweden location is literally underground. Proton owns and operates all Secure Core locations itself, with no rentals or third-party managers. Almost no other VPNs pay as much attention to physical security as Proton VPN does with this feature. The second hop makes Secure Core connections slower on average, but it's worth it if you have something especially sensitive to do online. Kill switch Proton VPN includes a kill switch, a standard feature. When active, a kill switch cuts off your internet whenever your connection to the VPN drops. This means you're never in danger of leaking your real identity or location, even for a second. It also protects you against the TunnelVision exploit, which requires the hacker to make a fake VPN server. Split tunneling Split tunneling is included on the Windows and Android apps, but users on other devices can access it through the browser extension. With split tunneling, some apps or websites get online through the VPN, while others stay unprotected. Split tunneling with Proton VPN on Android.Sam Chapman for Engadget Proton VPN allows split tunneling by both app and IP address. This grants you a precise level of control over your split, as long as you know the IP of each website you're placing on the list (you can find that out using DNS checker). Torrenting servers and port forwarding Proton VPN is one of the best VPNs for torrenting. It restricts torrenting to P2P servers, but nearly every server on the list is a P2P server — only Secure Core servers and some free servers don't permit torrenting. Combine that with the fact that it maintains 96 percent of your upload speeds on average, and you should have few problems using a torrenting client. Proton VPN's list of P2P servers.Sam Chapman for Engadget It also has some support for port forwarding, which can improve torrenting speed. Windows and Linux users can enable it with a simple toggle, which provides an active port number for configuring private servers. Mac users can set up port forwarding through manual OpenVPN or WireGuard configurations. Tor over VPN A handful of Proton VPN servers route you directly to the Tor network after encrypting your connection. While connected to one of these Tor over VPN servers, which are marked with TOR in their names and an onion symbol, you'll be able to open .onion links on a normal browser. This is more than just convenient — Tor over VPN is the safest way to access the dark web. With the VPN as an intermediary, you're never connecting to Tor with your own IP address, so malicious node operators can't see your real identity. For maximum privacy, use Tor Browser to create your Proton VPN account, so you're never exposed at any point in the process. Proton VPN has Tor servers in six countries (the U.S., France, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany and Hong Kong). Each just has one Tor server, except the United States, which gets two. Tor over VPN is supported on all platforms, but it won't work on Mac or iOS unless you have the kill switch enabled. Profiles A \"profile\" on Proton VPN is a group of pre-established settings you can use to quickly configure the VPN for a particular task. Two profiles are available from the start: Fastest, which connects to the fastest server, and Random, which always connects to a different server. You can create more profiles by toggling four settings: Feature: The type of server used. Choose from Standard, Secure Core, P2P or Tor over VPN. Country: The country to which the profile connects. Server: A server within that country. You can also select \"fastest\" or \"random.\" Protocol: Which VPN protocol the profile will use. \"Smart\" can be selected. As an example, say you want to watch a TV series that's only available on Netflix in Canada. You could create a profile called \"Netflix Canada\" that connects to the fastest Canadian server with just one click. We'd call profiles situationally useful, but they can save a lot of time if you regularly perform the same action on your VPN. Proton VPN customer support options We went to Proton VPN's FAQ pages with two questions that came up while researching other sections: which of Proton VPN's servers are managed by third parties, and why do certain server locations (like Marseilles) run slow despite the app showing a light load? You can access the help center through any of Proton VPN's apps, or by going directly to the website. Articles appear to be organized into six categories. Oddly, clicking any category button only shows you a handful of the articles in that section — for example, the Troubleshooting category looks like it only has five articles. If you type \"troubleshooting\" into the search bar, though, you'll see dozens pop up. There are even some sections, like Billing, that don't appear on the main page at all. It has the feel of a website update that wasn't adequately brought in line with the bulk of the support content. Until Proton fixes it, just use the search bar for everything. The articles themselves are well-written, give or take some stilted English. Getting quick help We couldn't find written answers to our questions about ownership and server load, so we turned to live chat. Free users should keep in mind that live chat support is only available on paid accounts, but there's a fairly active subreddit at r/protonvpn where Proton staff frequently post. Live chat is not intuitively located on protonvpn.com. We finally found it by scrolling all the way to the bottom of the main page, only to be told nobody was online to help at the moment — live chat is only accessible from 9 AM to midnight Central European Time (CET). We submitted our question about the Marseille servers as an email ticket instead. Sam Chapman for Engadget This part was easy, at least, as the form helpfully populated our system information. We also got a prompt response within 24 hours. We ended the interaction there, as we weren't able to reproduce the sluggish behavior on the French server locations, but it's nice to know the team will answer quickly. Proton VPN background check: The CERN origins of Proton AG Proton VPN launched in 2017, but its team's experience goes back much farther. The founders of its parent company, Proton AG, met while working at CERN in Switzerland, and the company remains under Swiss jurisdiction. Their first product, Proton Mail, went live in 2014 after a successful crowdfunding campaign, and claims to have 100 million users today. Proton VPN was Proton AG's second project. Like Proton Mail, it consists of a free plan supplemented by paid upgrades. Since then, Proton has introduced several more products: Proton Calendar in 2020, Proton Drive cloud storage in 2022 and the Proton Pass password manager in 2023, each designed around using end-to-end encryption to make user data inaccessible. The Proton Foundation Proton announced in 2024 that the majority of its shares had been acquired by the Proton Foundation, a nonprofit whose only purpose is to control Proton stock. Among other benefits, this prevents it from being purchased by anyone who disagrees with its mission. To sell to an objectionable parent company, the entire board of trustees would have to agree, which feels unlikely based on Proton's track record. Throughout Proton's history, we only found two incidents serious enough to comment on, and only one of them concerned Proton VPN. We'll cover them both below. ProtonMail law enforcement collaboration allegations On the page that hosts its annual transparency report, Proton states openly that it \"may be legally compelled to disclose certain user information to Swiss authorities\" (see the Privacy Policy section of this article for more on precisely what information that describes). In 2021, the company admitted it had given Swiss police (acting on a French warrant) a ProtonMail user's IP address and device logs. The police arrested the user, a French environmental activist. While that's unnerving for privacy-minded users, there are some important contextual issues to consider. Most importantly, ProtonMail is not governed by the same policy as Proton VPN. At the time the case unfolded, Swiss law obliged all email companies to comply with court orders from Swiss authorities to hand over data. VPNs aren't subject to those retention requirements. Today, Swiss email companies have been reclassified so they're also exempt from data retention requirements, thanks in part to a policy change Proton fought for. A representative from Proton confirmed that \"under Swiss law, we are not obligated to save any user connection logs.\" It's also reassuring that, despite complying with the subpoena, Proton wasn't able to turn over the contents of any emails. Alleged WireGuard memory vulnerability In January 2025, researchers at Venak Security alleged that Proton VPN lacks memory protection for keys generated under the WireGuard protocol, which might let hackers scrape the keys and decrypt intercepted communications. Proton responded to Venak in a blog post, which a Proton representative confirmed remains their official response to the allegations. In short: the Venak article only demonstrates that it's possible to view public keys, not private ones. This isn't much of a bombshell, given that \"public\" is right there in the name. But asymmetric encryption — the kind used by VPN protocols like WireGuard — requires both keys to decrypt any messages. Even if a hacker were able to get ahold of a private key, they likely wouldn't be able to use it for anything. WireGuard incorporates perfect forward secrecy by default, changing session keys often enough that any given key is obsolete by the time it's stolen. Final verdict In short, we're prepared to recommend Proton VPN to almost anybody. Whether you're mainly concerned with security, streaming or something else, chances are good that you'll be satisfied. The only serious downsides are that the long-term plans are overpriced and that it's hard to get live tech support if you live outside of Europe. It's also our unqualified pick for the best free VPN, but with the caveat that it's a bad choice for anyone who needs to choose specific server locations. If all you care about is staying hidden from your ISP and advertisers, Proton should be your first choice.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html?src=rss",

Traditional, manual patching is now a liability, rendering enter organizations defenseless against weaponized AI attacks \"Threat actors are reverse engineering patches, and the speed at which they&#x27;re doing it has been enhanced greatly by AI,\" Mike Riemer, SVP of Network Security Group and Field CISO at Ivanti told VentureBeat in a recent interview. \"They&#x27;re able to reverse engineer a patch within 72 hours. So if I release a patch and a customer doesn&#x27;t patch within 72 hours of that release, they&#x27;re open to exploit.\"This isn&#x27;t theoretical speculation. It&#x27;s the hard reality forcing vendors to rearchitect their security infrastructure from the kernel up completely. Last week, Ivanti released Connect Secure (ICS) version 25.X, marking what Riemer calls \"tangible evidence\" of the company&#x27;s commitment to meeting this threat head-on.At DEF CON 33 researchers from AmberWolf proved this threat real, demonstrating complete authentication bypasses in Zscaler, Netskope, and Check Point by exploiting vulnerabilities that existed for months, including Zscaler&#x27;s failure to validate SAML assertions (CVE-2025-54982), Netskope’s credential-free OrgKey access, and Check Point’s hard-coded SFTP keys exposing tenant logs were all flaws left open and exploitable more than 16 months after initial disclosure.Why Kernel Security matters The kernel is the central orchestrator of everything that happens in a computing device, controlling memory, processes, and hardware. If an attacker compromises the kernel, they&#x27;ve seized total control of a device that can scale to compromising an entire network. Any other security layer or application, platform or safeguard is immediately bypassed with attackers take control of the kernel.Nearly all operating systems rely on the concept of enforcing rings of privilege. Applications run in user mode with limited access. The kernel operates in kernel mode with complete control. When adversaries break that barrier, they’ve gained access to what many security researchers consider the holy grail of a systems and entire networks’ vulnerabilities.Ivanti&#x27;s new release directly addresses this reality. Connect Secure 25.X runs on an enterprise-grade Oracle Linux operating system with strong Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) enforcement that can limit a threat actor&#x27;s abilities within the system. The solution includes Secure Boot protection, disk encryption, key management, secure factory reset, a modern secure web server, and Web Application Firewall (WAF), all designed to secure key aspects of the system and significantly deter external threats.\"In the past year, we&#x27;ve significantly advanced our Secure by Design strategy, translating our commitment into real action through substantial investments and an expanded security team,\" Riemer explained. \"This release stands as tangible evidence of our commitment. We listened to our customers, invested in both technology and talent, and modernized the security of Ivanti Connect Secure to provide the resilience and peace of mind our customers expect and deserve.\"From OS rings to Deployment Rings: A more complete defense strategyWhile operating system rings define privilege levels, modern patch management has adopted its own ring strategy to combat the 72-hour exploit window. Ring deployment provides a phased, automated patching strategy that rolls out updates incrementally: a Test Ring for core IT validation, an Early Adopter Ring for compatibility testing, and a Production Ring for enterprise-wide rollout.This approach directly addresses the speed crisis. Ring deployment achieves 99% patch success within 24 hours for up to 100,000 PCs, according to Gartner research. Ponemon Institute research shows organizations take an alarming average of 43 days to detect cyberattacks even after a patch is released.Jesse Miller, SVP and director of IT at Southstar Bank, emphasized: \"When judging how impactful something can be, you have to take everything from current events, your industry, your environment and more into the equation.\" His team uses ring deployment to reduce their attack surface as quickly as possible.Attackers aggressively exploit legacy vulnerabilities with 76% of vulnerabilities leveraged by ransomware were reported between 2010 and 2019. When kernel access is at stake, every hour of delay multiplies the risk exponentially.The Kernel Dilemma centers on balancing security versus stabilityAt CrowdStrike&#x27;s FalCon conference, Chief Technology Innovation Officer Alex Ionescu laid out the problem: \"By now, it&#x27;s clear that if you want to protect against bad actors, you need to operate in the kernel. But to do that, the reliability of your machine is put at risk.\"The industry is responding with fundamental shifts:Microsoft&#x27;s WISP mandates multi-year changes for every Windows security vendorLinux embraced eBPF for safer kernel instrumentationApple&#x27;s Endpoint Security Framework enables user-mode operationAuthentication bypass happens when kernels are compromised AmberWolf researchers spent seven months analyzing ZTNA products. Zscaler failed to validate SAML assertions (CVE-2024-54982). Netskope&#x27;s authentication could be bypassed using non-revocable OrgKey values. Check Point had hard-coded SFTP keys (CVE-2025-3831).These vulnerabilities existed for months. Some vendors patched quietly without CVEs. As of August 2025, 16 months after disclosure, many organizations still used exploitable configurations.Lessons learned from compressing 3 years of kernel security into 18 months When nation-state attackers exploited Ivanti Connect Secure in January 2024, it validated Ivanti’s decision to rapidly advance its kernel-level security strategy, compressing a three-year project into just 18 months. As Riemer explained, \"We had already completed phase one of the kernel-hardening project before the attack. That allowed us to quickly pivot and accelerate our roadmap.”Key accomplishments included:Migration to 64-bit Oracle Linux: Ivanti replaced an outdated 32-bit CentOS OS with Oracle Linux 9, significantly reducing known vulnerabilities tied to legacy open-source components.Custom SELinux enforcement: Implementing strict SELinux policies initially broke a significant number of product features, requiring careful refactoring without compromising security parameters. The resulting solution now runs in permanent enforcement mode, Riemer explained. Process de-privileging and secure boot with TPM: Ivanti eliminated root privileges from critical processes and integrated TPM-based secure boot and RSA encryption, ensuring continuous integrity checks, aligning with AmberWolf’s research recommendations and findings.There were also a series of independent penetration testing initiatives, and each confirmed zero successful compromises, with threat actors typically abandoning attempts within three days. Riemer explained to VentureBeat that global intelligence community customers actively watched threat actors probe the hardened systems. \"They tried old TTPs, pivoted to web server exploits. They pretty much gave up after about three days,\" Riemer said. The decision to go kernel-level wasn&#x27;t a panic response. \"We actually had plans in place in 2023 to address this before we ever got attacked,\" Riemer said. The conversation that sealed the decision happened in Washington, DC. \"I sat down with the CIO of a federal agency, and I asked him flat out: Is there going to be a need for the U.S. government to have an L3 VPN solution on-prem in the future?\" Riemer recalled. \"His response was that there would always be a mission need for an L3 VPN on-prem type solution in order to give encrypted communication access to the warfighter.\"The future beyond kernel security includes eBPF and Behavioral MonitoringGartner&#x27;s Emerging Tech Impact Radar: Cloud Security report rates eBPF as having \"high\" mass with 1-3 years to early majority adoption. \"The use of eBPF allows for enhanced visibility and security without relying solely on kernel-level agents,\" Gartner notes.The majority of cybersecurity security vendors are investing heavily in eBPF. \"Today, almost our entire customer base runs Falcon sensor on top of eBPF,\" Ionescu said during his keynote at this year’s Fal.Con. \"We&#x27;ve been part of that journey as eBPF foundation members.\"Palo Alto Networks has also emerged as a major player in eBPF-based security, investing heavily in the technology for their Cortex XDR and Prisma Cloud platforms. This architectural shift allows Palo Alto Networks to provide deep visibility into system calls, network traffic, and process execution while maintaining system reliability.The convergence of CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Networks, and other major vendors on eBPF technology signals a fundamental transformation—providing the visibility security teams need without catastrophic failure risks.Defensive strategies that are workingPatching is often relegated to one of those tasks that gets procrastinated about because so many security teams are short-handed, facing chronic time shortages. Those are the conditions that adversaries bank on when they choose victims. It’s a sure bet that if a company is not prioritizing cybersecurity, they will be months or even years back on their patching. That’s what adversaries look for. Patterns emerge from different industries of victims and they share a common trait of procrastinating about system maintenance in general and security patterns specifically. Based on interviewing victims of breaches that started with patches sometimes years old, VentureBeat has seen the following immediate steps they take to reduce the probabilo9ty of being hit again: Automate patching immediately. Monthly cycles are obsolete. Tony Miller, Ivanti&#x27;s VP of enterprise services, confirmed ring deployment eliminates the reactive patching chaos that leaves organizations vulnerable during the critical 72-hour window.Audit kernel-level security. Ask vendors about eBPF/ESF/WISP migration plans and timelines.Layer defenses. This is table stakes for any cybersecurity strategy but critical to get right. \"Whether it was SELinux profiling, root privilege avoidance, an updated web server, or the WAF—each layer stopped attacks,\" Riemer said.Demand transparency. \"Another vendor had been attacked in November 2023. That information didn&#x27;t come available until August 2024,\" Riemer revealed. \"This is why Ivanti has been so public about transparency.\"The bottom lineKernel-level transformation isn&#x27;t optional. It&#x27;s survival when AI weaponizes vulnerabilities in three days.Ivanti Connect Secure 25.X represents what&#x27;s possible when a vendor commits fully to kernel-level security, not as a reactive measure, but as a fundamental architectural principle. Gartner&#x27;s strategic planning assumption is sobering: \"By 2030, at least 80% of enterprise Windows endpoints will still rely on hybrid endpoint protection agents, increasing the attack surface and requiring rigorous validation.\"Organizations must harden what they can now, automate immediately, and prepare for architectural upheaval. As Gartner emphasizes, combining ring deployment with integrated compensating controls including endpoint protection platforms, multifactor authentication, and network segmentation as part of a broader zero-trust framework ensures security teams can shrink exposure windows.",

          "standfirst": "We generally consider Apple’s iPads to be the best tablets for most people, but most of them don’t come cheap. To help you get the most value possible, we’re keeping a constant eye on sale prices and rounding up the best iPad deals we can find each week.This week has been a particularly fruitful time to be in the market for an Apple tablet: Amazon held its latest Prime Day sale on October 7-8, while other retailers like Best Buy, Target and Walmart are still running sweeping sales of their own. A number of Apple device discounts from these events are still available today, including the base iPad (A16) for $279 and a $150 drop for the iPad Air. Beyond iPads, other gadgets like the AirPods 4, MacBook Air and AirTag remain heavily discounted as well. Here are all the top deals on Apple gear we could find this week. Best iPad deals Apple iPad Air (11-inch, M3) for $449 ($150 off MSRP): The most recent iPad Air is a relatively minor update, as the only major addition is a more powerful M3 chip. However, we still recommend the Air over the base model in our iPad buying guide: Its display is laminated, more color-rich and better at fending off glare (though it's still 60Hz); its speakers are more robust; it works with Apple’s best accessories and its performance should hold up better in the years ahead. We saw the base model drop as low as $437 during Amazon's Prime Day sale this week, but this $150 discount ties the best price we've seen otherwise. Other configurations are also $150 off. Also at Best Buy. Apple iPad Air (13-inch, M3) for $649 ($150 off): Engadget's Nate Ingraham gave the 13-inch iPad Air a score of 89 when it was released in March. It has a bigger and slightly brighter display than its 11-inch counterpart but is otherwise the same. If you plan to keep your iPad hooked up to a keyboard, the extra screen space is lovely for multitasking or just taking in movies. This discount is an all-time low, and it applies to several color options and storage configs. Also at Best Buy. Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro) for $399 ($100 off): The 8.3-inch iPad mini is exactly what it sounds like: the smaller iPad. The newest iteration has an improved A17 Pro chip — which is enough to support Apple Intelligence — alongside 128GB of storage in the base model and Apple Pencil Pro support. You’d buy it if you want a tablet you can more easily hold with one hand. We saw it available for $20 less during Amazon's Prime Day sale, but this is still a decent drop from its typical going rate. Also at Best Buy. Best Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $89 ($40 off): If you don't need ANC, the standard AirPods 4 are still a good buy for those who hate the feeling of pairs that jut into their ear canal. They lack built-in volume controls, and no open-style earbuds can produce the same level of bass response as traditional in-ear headphones, but they generally sound more pleasant than most pairs of this type, and they still offer a host of Apple-friendly features. This is another all-time low. Also at Walmart, or Best Buy for $1 more. Apple AirTags (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off): We may see an updated model by the end of the year, but the current AirTags are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone owners right now thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultra-wideband tech that makes it easy to locate nearby items. Just note that you'll need a separate AirTag holder to attach them to your keys, wallet or bag. This deal comes within a dollar of the lowest price we've seen for a four-pack. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. If you just want one, individual AirTags are a bit cheaper than usual at $20 as well. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This discount ties the all-time low for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, but configs with more memory and storage are $200 off as well. Also at Best Buy. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but has better speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. The notebook very briefly fell as low as $969 earlier this week, but this is a solid drop all the same. Other configs are similarly discounted. Also at Best Buy. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The top-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a fine discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Apple AirPods Max for $429 ($120 off): The AirPods Max are bulkier and older than Sony’s WH-1000XM6 — the top pick in our guide to the best wireless headphones — plus they rely on a weirdly flimsy case to preserve power, so we only recommend them to hardcore Apple fans. That said, their ANC and warm sound profile still rank among the better options on the market, and they offer most of the same handy features as the in-ear AirPods. This model is virtually the same as the pair we reviewed way back in 2020, only it has a USB-C port and supports lossless audio with a cable. This discount is $30 off the pair’s lowest-ever price, but it’s the biggest drop we’ve seen since July. Apple iMac (M4) for $1,149 ($150 off): We like the M4 iMac as an all-in-one computer thanks to its powerful performance, standard 16GB of RAM and improved webcam. Just note that it only comes in a 24-inch screen size option. This deal on the base model isn't quite an all-time low, but it's roughly $40 lower than the desktop's usual street price and a decent savings compared to buying directly from Apple. Also at Best Buy. Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS, 42mm) for $389 ($10 off): The latest flagship Apple Watch only hit the market last month, but Amazon is already selling it for $10 off. It doesn't show up as a percentage off, but you'll see some models listed at $389 instead of Apple's $399 MSRP. If you're new to Apple's wearables or are ready to upgrade from a Series 9 or older, this is a good model to grab. If you're coming from a Series 10, however, there's not much need to upgrade as the only major change from last year's model is a slightly larger battery and a tougher screen. Apple Watch SE 3 (GPS, 40mm) for $240 ($9 off): There's a similar stealth discount for the newest budget model, the Apple Watch SE 3, at Amazon. It normally goes for $249 — again, not a big discount, but better than nothing if you're looking to get onboard early. Apple gave this model some badly needed updates compared to its predecessor, including an always-on display, faster charging, better sensors and the same processor that you'll find in the new Apple Watch Series 11.

Apple AirTags (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off): We may see an updated model by the end of the year, but the current AirTags are the best Bluetooth trackers for iPhone owners right now thanks to their vast finding network and accurate ultra-wideband tech that makes it easy to locate nearby items. Just note that you'll need a separate AirTag holder to attach them to your keys, wallet or bag. This deal comes within a dollar of the lowest price we've seen for a four-pack. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. If you just want one, individual AirTags are a bit cheaper than usual at $20 as well. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $799 ($200 off): Apple's latest MacBook Air is the top pick in our guide to the best laptops, and it earned a score of 92 in our review. It's not a major overhaul, but the design is still exceptionally thin, light and well-built, with long battery life and a top-notch keyboard and trackpad. Now it's a bit faster. (Though we'd still love more ports and a refresh rate higher than 60Hz.) This discount ties the all-time low for the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, but configs with more memory and storage are $200 off as well. Also at Best Buy. Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 ($200 off): The 15-inch MacBook Air is nearly identical to the smaller version but has better speakers and a more spacious trackpad alongside its roomier display. The notebook very briefly fell as low as $969 earlier this week, but this is a solid drop all the same. Other configs are similarly discounted. Also at Best Buy. Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off): The top-end option in Apple’s confusing stylus lineup, the Pencil Pro supports pressure sensitivity, wireless charging, tilt detection, haptic feedback and Apple’s double tap and squeeze gestures, among other perks. It’s a lovely tool for more intricate sketching and note-taking, but the catch is that it’s only compatible with the M4 iPad Pro, M2 and M3 iPad Air and most recent iPad mini. We've seen this deal fairly often over the course of the year, but it's a fine discount compared to buying from Apple directly. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Apple AirPods Max for $429 ($120 off): The AirPods Max are bulkier and older than Sony’s WH-1000XM6 — the top pick in our guide to the best wireless headphones — plus they rely on a weirdly flimsy case to preserve power, so we only recommend them to hardcore Apple fans. That said, their ANC and warm sound profile still rank among the better options on the market, and they offer most of the same handy features as the in-ear AirPods. This model is virtually the same as the pair we reviewed way back in 2020, only it has a USB-C port and supports lossless audio with a cable. This discount is $30 off the pair’s lowest-ever price, but it’s the biggest drop we’ve seen since July. Apple iMac (M4) for $1,149 ($150 off): We like the M4 iMac as an all-in-one computer thanks to its powerful performance, standard 16GB of RAM and improved webcam. Just note that it only comes in a 24-inch screen size option. This deal on the base model isn't quite an all-time low, but it's roughly $40 lower than the desktop's usual street price and a decent savings compared to buying directly from Apple. Also at Best Buy. Apple Watch Series 11 (GPS, 42mm) for $389 ($10 off): The latest flagship Apple Watch only hit the market last month, but Amazon is already selling it for $10 off. It doesn't show up as a percentage off, but you'll see some models listed at $389 instead of Apple's $399 MSRP. If you're new to Apple's wearables or are ready to upgrade from a Series 9 or older, this is a good model to grab. If you're coming from a Series 10, however, there's not much need to upgrade as the only major change from last year's model is a slightly larger battery and a tougher screen. Apple Watch SE 3 (GPS, 40mm) for $240 ($9 off): There's a similar stealth discount for the newest budget model, the Apple Watch SE 3, at Amazon. It normally goes for $249 — again, not a big discount, but better than nothing if you're looking to get onboard early. Apple gave this model some badly needed updates compared to its predecessor, including an always-on display, faster charging, better sensors and the same processor that you'll find in the new Apple Watch Series 11.

          "standfirst": "Enterprises expanding AI deployments are hitting an invisible performance wall. The culprit? Static speculators that can&#x27;t keep up with shifting workloads.Speculators are smaller AI models that work alongside large language models during inference. They draft multiple tokens ahead, which the main model then verifies in parallel. This technique (called speculative decoding) has become essential for enterprises trying to reduce inference costs and latency. Instead of generating tokens one at a time, the system can accept multiple tokens at once, dramatically improving throughput.Together AI today announced research and a new system called ATLAS (AdapTive-LeArning Speculator System) that aims to help enterprises overcome the challenge of static speculators. The technique provides a self-learning inference optimization capability that can help to deliver up to 400% faster inference performance than a baseline level of performance available in existing inference technologies such as vLLM.. The system addresses a critical problem: as AI workloads evolve, inference speeds degrade, even with specialized speculators in place.The company which got its start in 2023, has been focused on optimizing inference on its enterprise AI platform. Earlier this year the company raised $305 million as customer adoption and demand has grown.\"Companies we work with generally, as they scale up, they see shifting workloads, and then they don&#x27;t see as much speedup from speculative execution as before,\" Tri Dao, chief scientist at Together AI, told VentureBeat in an exclusive interview. \"These speculators generally don&#x27;t work well when their workload domain starts to shift.\"The workload drift problem no one talks aboutMost speculators in production today are \"static\" models. They&#x27;re trained once on a fixed dataset representing expected workloads, then deployed without any ability to adapt. Companies like Meta and Mistral ship pre-trained speculators alongside their main models. Inference platforms like vLLM use these static speculators to boost throughput without changing output quality.But there&#x27;s a catch. When an enterprise&#x27;s AI usage evolves the static speculator&#x27;s accuracy plummets.\"If you&#x27;re a company producing coding agents, and most of your developers have been writing in Python, all of a sudden some of them switch to writing Rust or C, then you see the speed starts to go down,\" Dao explained. \"The speculator has a mismatch between what it was trained on versus what the actual workload is.\"This workload drift represents a hidden tax on scaling AI. Enterprises either accept degraded performance or invest in retraining custom speculators. That process captures only a snapshot in time and quickly becomes outdated.How adaptive speculators work: A dual-model approachATLAS uses a dual-speculator architecture that combines stability with adaptation:The static speculator - A heavyweight model trained on broad data provides consistent baseline performance. It serves as a \"speed floor.\"The adaptive speculator - A lightweight model learns continuously from live traffic. It specializes on-the-fly to emerging domains and usage patterns.The confidence-aware controller - An orchestration layer dynamically chooses which speculator to use. It adjusts the speculation \"lookahead\" based on confidence scores.\"Before the adaptive speculator learns anything, we still have the static speculator to help provide the speed boost in the beginning,\" Ben Athiwaratkun, staff AI scientist at Together AI explained to VentureBeat. \"Once the adaptive speculator becomes more confident, then the speed grows over time.\"The technical innovation lies in balancing acceptance rate (how often the target model agrees with drafted tokens) and draft latency. As the adaptive model learns from traffic patterns, the controller relies more on the lightweight speculator and extends lookahead. This compounds performance gains.Users don&#x27;t need to tune any parameters. \"On the user side, users don&#x27;t have to turn any knobs,\" Dao said. \"On our side, we have turned these knobs for users to adjust in a configuration that gets good speedup.\"Performance that rivals custom siliconTogether AI&#x27;s testing shows ATLAS reaching 500 tokens per second on DeepSeek-V3.1 when fully adapted. More impressively, those numbers on Nvidia B200 GPUs match or exceed specialized inference chips like Groq&#x27;s custom hardware.\"The software and algorithmic improvement is able to close the gap with really specialized hardware,\" Dao said. \"We were seeing 500 tokens per second on these huge models that are even faster than some of the customized chips.\"The 400% speedup that the company claims for inference represents the cumulative effect of Together&#x27;s Turbo optimization suite. FP4 quantization delivers 80% speedup over FP8 baseline. The static Turbo Speculator adds another 80-100% gain. The adaptive system layers on top. Each optimization compounds the benefits of the others.Compared to standard inference engines like vLLM or Nvidia&#x27;s TensorRT-LLM, the improvement is substantial. Together AI benchmarks against the stronger baseline between the two for each workload before applying speculative optimizations.The memory-compute tradeoff explainedThe performance gains stem from exploiting a fundamental inefficiency in modern inference: wasted compute capacity.Dao explained that typically during inference, much of the compute power is not fully utilized.\"During inference, which is actually the dominant workload nowadays, you&#x27;re mostly using the memory subsystem,\" he said.Speculative decoding trades idle compute for reduced memory access. When a model generates one token at a time, it&#x27;s memory-bound. The GPU sits idle while waiting for memory. But when the speculator proposes five tokens and the target model verifies them simultaneously, compute utilization spikes while memory access remains roughly constant.\"The total amount of compute to generate five tokens is the same, but you only had to access memory once, instead of five times,\" Dao said.Think of it as intelligent caching for AIFor infrastructure teams familiar with traditional database optimization, adaptive speculators function like an intelligent caching layer, but with a crucial difference.Traditional caching systems like Redis or memcached require exact matches. You store the exact same query result and retrieve it when that specific query runs again. Adaptive speculators work differently.\"You can view it as an intelligent way of caching, not storing exactly, but figuring out some patterns that you see,\" Dao explained. \"Broadly, we&#x27;re observing that you&#x27;re working with similar code, or working with similar, you know, controlling compute in a similar way. We can then predict what the big model is going to say. We just get better and better at predicting that.\"Rather than storing exact responses, the system learns patterns in how the model generates tokens. It recognizes that if you&#x27;re editing Python files in a specific codebase, certain token sequences become more likely. The speculator adapts to those patterns, improving its predictions over time without requiring identical inputs.Use cases: RL training and evolving workloadsTwo enterprise scenarios particularly benefit from adaptive speculators:Reinforcement learning training: Static speculators quickly fall out of alignment as the policy evolves during training. ATLAS adapts continuously to the shifting policy distribution.Evolving workloads: As enterprises discover new AI use cases, workload composition shifts. \"Maybe they started using AI for chatbots, but then they realized, hey, it can write code, so they start shifting to code,\" Dao said. \"Or they realize these AIs can actually call tools and control computers and do accounting and things like that.\"In a vibe-coding session, the adaptive system can specialize for the specific codebase being edited. These are files not seen during training. This further increases acceptance rates and decoding speed.What it means for enterprises and the inference ecosystemATLAS is available now on Together AI&#x27;s dedicated endpoints as part of the platform at no additional cost. The company&#x27;s 800,000-plus developers (up from 450,000 in February) have access to the optimization.But the broader implications extend beyond one vendor&#x27;s product. The shift from static to adaptive optimization represents a fundamental rethinking of how inference platforms should work. As enterprises deploy AI across multiple domains, the industry will need to move beyond one-time trained models toward systems that learn and improve continuously.Together AI has historically released some of its research techniques as open source and collaborated with projects like vLLM. While the fully integrated ATLAS system is proprietary, some of the underlying techniques may eventually influence the broader inference ecosystem. For enterprises looking to lead in AI, the message is clear: adaptive algorithms on commodity hardware can match custom silicon at a fraction of the cost. As this approach matures across the industry, software optimization increasingly trumps specialized hardware.",

You can now add the UK to the list of Google's governmental worries. The country's antitrust regulator, known as the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), has confirmed that Google has \"strategic market status,\" paving the way to more limits on how Google does business in the UK. Naturally, Google objects to this course of action. The designation is connected to the UK's new digital markets competition regime, which was enacted at the beginning of the year. Shortly after, the CMA announced it was conducting an investigation into whether Google should be designated with strategic market status. The outcome of that process is a resounding \"yes.\" This label does not mean Google has done anything illegal or that it is subject to immediate regulation. It simply means the company has \"substantial and entrenched market power\" in one or more areas under the purview of the CMA. Specifically, the agency has found that Google is dominant in search and search advertising, holding a greater than 90 percent share of Internet searches in the UK.Read full article Comments",

All profits from the one-off project will be donated to the American Library Association to fight censorship. While a clever way to stick it to Trump, this week's news did raise a question I've heard from several readers: If CAH is this upset about the whiplash-inducing tariff rates, which are added and then removed with almost no warning, why doesn't it print the game in the US? I mean, it's just a box of cards! How hard can it be? In the board game space, designers have wrestled with this question for years. While many US-based designers would like to work with local manufacturers, in reality, it's often not possible. Complex board games today may feature cardboard creations like constructible dice towers, custom-shaped and painted wooden markers, multicolored jewel pieces, plastic bits of nearly every possible variety, custom-printed component bags, molded miniatures, cards in multiple sizes, metallic coins, dry-erase boards, fancy box inserts, massive dual-sided playing boards, and long manuals. The only manufacturers capable of doing all this work are generally in China or central Europe (Germany still has good manufacturing, and there are also sites in Poland and the Czech Republic).Read full article Comments",

Now the company is upping the stakes again. At the Hexacon offensive security conference in Paris on Friday, Apple vice president of security engineering and architecture Ivan Krstić announced a new maximum payout of $2 million for a chain of software exploits that could be abused for spyware. The move reflects how valuable exploitable vulnerabilities can be within Apple's highly protected mobile environment—and the lengths the company will go to to keep such discoveries from falling into the wrong hands. In addition to individual payouts, the company's bug bounty also includes a bonus structure, adding additional awards for exploits that can bypass its extra secure Lockdown Mode as well as those discovered while Apple software is still in its beta testing phase. Taken together, the maximum award for what would otherwise be a potentially catastrophic exploit chain will now be $5 million. The changes take effect next month. “We are lining up to pay many millions of dollars here, and there’s a reason,” Krstić tells WIRED. “We want to make sure that for the hardest categories, the hardest problems, the things that most closely mirror the kinds of attacks that we see with mercenary spyware—that the researchers who have those skills and abilities and put in that effort and time can get a tremendous reward.\"Read full article Comments",

It has been in development since 2022. The comic book version of the character is the son of a rich industrialist who inherits the family munitions factory but is being crushed by the competition: Stark Industries. Baron Zemo (Falcon and the Winter Soldier) then recruits him to infiltrate and betray the Avengers, giving him super powers (\"ionic energy\") via a special serum. He eventually becomes a superhero and Avengers ally, helping them take on Doctor Doom, among other exploits.

          "content": "Microsoft is warning of an active scam that diverts employees' paycheck payments to attacker-controlled accounts after first taking over their profiles on Workday or other cloud-based HR services. Payroll Pirate, as Microsoft says the campaign has been dubbed, gains access to victims’ HR portals by sending them phishing emails that trick the recipients into providing their credentials for logging in to the cloud account. The scammers are able to recover multi-factor authentication codes by using adversary-in-the-middle tactics, which work by sitting between the victims and the site they think they’re logging in to, which is, in fact, a fake site operated by the attackers. Not all MFA is created equal The attackers then enter the intercepted credentials, including the MFA code, into the real site. This tactic, which has grown increasingly common in recent years, underscores the importance of adopting FIDO-compliant forms of MFA, which are immune to such attacks.Read full article Comments",

Now that we're nearly five full years into the PS5 era, it's time for Sony and AMD to start teasing the new chips that will power what Cerny calls \"a future console in a few years' time.\" In a quick nine-minute video posted Thursday, Cerny sat down with Jack Huynh, the senior VP and general manager of AMD's Computing and Graphics Group, to talk about \"Project Amethyst,\" a co-engineering effort between both companies that was also teased back in July. And while that Project Amethyst hardware currently only exists in the form of a simulation, Cerny said that the \"results are quite promising\" for a project that's still in the \"early days.\" Mo’ ML, fewer problems? Project Amethyst is focused on going beyond traditional rasterization techniques that don't scale well when you try to \"brute force that with raw power alone,\" Huynh said in the video. Instead, the new architecture is focused on more efficient running of the kinds of machine-learning-based neural networks behind AMD's FSR upscaling technology and Sony's similar PSSR system.Read full article Comments",

On the right tires, it could show a VW Golf GTI a thing or two, and while it might have been slow-charging, it could still be a decent road-tripper. All of this helped the Bolt become General Motors' best-selling EV, at least until its used-to-be-called Ultium platform got up and running. And that's despite a costly recall that required replacing batteries in tens of thousands of Bolts because of some badly folded cells. But GM had other plans for the Bolt's factory, and in 2023, it announced its impending death. The reaction from EV enthusiasts, and Bolt owners in particular, was so overwhelmingly negative that just a few months later, GM CEO Mary Barra backtracked, promising to bring the Bolt back, this time with a don't-call-it-Ultium-anymore battery.Read full article Comments",

The September 22 cease-and-desist letter from the state Bureau of Water Pollution Control alleged repeated violations of a settlement agreement that the company had entered into after being fined five years ago for discharging groundwater into storm drains without a permit. That agreement, signed by a Boring executive in 2022, was intended to compel the company to comply with state water pollution laws. Instead, state inspectors documented nearly 100 alleged new violations of the agreement.

Workers collect dead leaves, wood, and grass to stack them in underground fungus gardens called combs. There, the fungi break down the tough plant fibers, making them accessible for the termites in an elaborate form of symbiotic agriculture. Like any other agriculturalist, however, the termites face a challenge: weeds. “There have been numerous studies suggesting the termites must have some kind of fixed response—that they always do the same exact thing when they detect weed infestation,” says Rhitoban Raychoudhury, a professor of biological sciences at the Indian Institute of Science Education, “but that was not the case.” In a new Science study, Raychoudhury’s team discovered that termites have pretty advanced, surprisingly human-like gardening practices. Going blind Termites do not look like particularly good gardeners at first glance. They are effectively blind, which is not that surprising considering they spend most of their life in complete darkness working in endless corridors of their mounds. But termites make up for their lack of sight with other senses. \"They can detect the environment based on advanced olfactory reception and touch, and I think this is what they use to identify the weeds in their gardens,\" Raychoudhury says. To learn how termites react once they detect a weed infestation, his team collected some Odontotermes obesus and challenged them with different gardening problems.Read full article Comments",
