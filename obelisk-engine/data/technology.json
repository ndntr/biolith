          "standfirst": "Laptop power banks hit a happy medium between capacity and portability. Capacity is usually below 100-watt hours to comply with TSA requirements for carry-on luggage. Since most batteries are listed in milliamp hours, that works out to around 27,000mAh or less — but not too much less. Anything below 20,000mAh won’t be able to give any meaningful charge to a laptop’s battery. Other than that, these larger portable chargers don’t differ all that much from any other battery — and there are thousands of options out there with varying degrees of value, utility and function. We tested dozens to help you pick out the best laptop battery for your next trip away from an outlet. Table of contents Best laptop power banks for 2025 What to look for in a laptop power bank How we test portable laptop chargers Other laptop power banks we tested Laptop power bank FAQs Recent updates Best laptop power banks for 2025 What to look for in a laptop power bank Flying with a laptop power bank Most portable batteries top out at around 27,000mAh so you can fly with them. The TSA currently limits the capacity carry-on batteries to 100Wh, which works out to around 27,500mAh for 3.6 volt lithium-ion batteries. Note that you’re not allowed to pack any batteries in your checked luggage, regardless of capacity. The TSA rules are intended to limit fire danger — and some airlines are implementing further restrictions due to recent on-board incidents. In March 2025, a Hong Kong flight was grounded after a battery pack caught fire in an overhead bin. A similar situation happened in July on a domestic Delta flight, and again in August on a transatlantic KLM flight. As a result, some airlines, including Emirates, Southwest and others have announced further restrictions on flying with battery packs. Rules include limiting the number of allowed portable chargers and requiring flyers to keep power banks in clear view when using them to recharge a device. If the battery pack isn’t actively in use, however, most rules allow them to stay in your carry-on bag in the overhead bin. Before flying, it’s wise to check your airline’s policies. Capacity If you just need to keep a smartphone from dying before you can make it home, just about any of the best power banks will do. But if you need to revive multiple devices or the substantial battery of a laptop, you’ll want something with a high milliamp-hour​​ (mAh) capacity. A power bank capable of delivering enough power to a laptop will have a capacity between 20,000 and 27,000 mAh. If you want something even bigger than a laptop power bank, and don’t need to fly with it, you’ll likely want to look into portable power stations. These can be the size of a car battery or larger and can potentially fuel an entire weekend away. Another thing to keep in mind is that the capacity listed in a power bank's specs is not what will be delivered to your devices. As I mentioned, the capacity of these banks is around 25,000mAh. Even the huge battery on a 16-inch MacBook Pro or a Dell XPS 16 has a mAh rating of around 5,000 - 6,000mAh, so you might think you’d get five full charges but in reality, you only get about a single 70-percent charge. The voltage is different (typically 3.7V for the power bank and 11.4V for a laptop) which makes the watt-hours, or the amount of energy each battery can hold, different (working out to 92Wh for the battery and 72Wh for the built-in laptop batteries). On top of that, in order to feed a charge from a power bank to a laptop, a voltage conversion takes place and that dissipates a decent amount of energy. Without turning this into a physics lesson, this all means that a power bank with a 25,000mAh (or 92Wh) capacity will typically fill a 5,000mAh (or 72Wh) laptop battery to about 75 percent. In my tests, I averaged about a 60-percent efficiency rate between a power bank’s listed capacity and the actual charge delivered. Ports Every large power bank I’ve tested has at least three USB ports, with a mix of USB-C and USB-A, which should cover nearly any portable device you need to recharge — earbuds, phones, tablets, laptops, you name it. In addition to the different plug formats, some ports supply power at different wattages. For example, one built-in USB-C port might be rated for 60 watts, while the one next to it is rated for 100 watts. So if you’ve got a device that’s capable of 70W fast charging, such as the new MacBook Air, you’d want to opt for the 100W port to get the best charging speeds possible. Note that devices with a smaller wattage draw won’t be negatively affected by connecting to ports with high ratings. For example, a Galaxy S24 Ultra, capable of 45W super fast charging, is perfectly compatible with the 100W port. A device will only draw what it can take, regardless of what a port can supply. Just remember that the port, device and charging cable need to be at or above the desired wattage rating to achieve maximum charging rates. Some of these larger batteries also have AC ports. It might seem like a natural fit to plug in your laptop’s power adapter for a recharge. But really, the AC port should only be for devices that can’t use USB — such as a lamp or a printer. Plugging a power adapter into the AC port only wastes energy through conversion. First, the battery converts its DC power to supply the port with AC power, then the power adapter converts that AC power back to DC so your laptop can take it in. And as you’ll remember from physics class, each time energy is converted, some is lost to heat and other dissipations. Better to cut out the middleman and just send that DC power straight from the battery to the device. Also, you can use more than one port at a time with these devices; just remember that the speed of whatever you’re charging will likely go down, and of course, the battery is going to drain proportionally to what you’re refilling. Wireless charging Just in the last year and a half that I’ve been testing portable power banks, wireless charging capabilities have noticeably improved. The first few I tried were painfully slow and not worth recommending. Now the wireless pads built into power banks are impressively fast — particularly, in my experience, when charging Samsung Galaxy phones (though the lack of a stabilizing magnetic connection like Apple’s MagSafe means they only work when rested flat on a pad). Most wireless charging connections can be used while other ports are also being employed, making them convenient for some mobile battlestation setups. Of course, wireless charging is always less efficient than wired, and recharging from an external battery is less efficient in general. If you want to waste as little energy as possible, you’re better off sticking to wired connections. Design All power banks are designed to be portable, but there’s a big difference between a pocket-friendly 5,000mAh battery and one of these laptop-compatible bruisers. Most of the latter weigh between a pound and a half to two pounds, which is a considerable addition to a backpack. Many of the options listed here have a display to tell you how much charge remains in the battery, which is helpful when you’re trying to judiciously meet out charges to your devices. If a bank has a wireless connection, the pad is usually on the flat top and any available AC connection is usually at one end. Both may require you to engage those charging methods. Don’t be like me and grumble loudly that you got a bum unit without pressing (and sometimes double pressing) all the buttons first. How we test portable laptop chargers For the past two years, I’ve been testing and using dozens of portable batteries for our other battery guide. Some of those batteries include the higher-capacity power banks you see here. I also got a hold of a few extra banks just for this guide to make sure we covered what’s available. I went for brands I’m already familiar with, as well as battery packs from well-received manufacturers I hadn’t tried before (like UGREEN and Lion Energy). I only considered banks with at least a 20,000mAh capacity and mostly stuck with those that rated 25,000mAh and higher. Here’s everything we tested: Zendure Supertank Pro Mophie Powerstation Pro XL Mophie Powerstation Pro AC Lion Energy Eclipse Mag Lion Energy Trek Baseus Blade Laptop Anker Prime 27,650mAh Goal Zero Sherpa 100 AC Anker Retractable Cable Laptop Bank HyperJuice 245W I tested each power bank with an Apple phone (iPhone 15), an Android phone (Galaxy S23 Ultra), a tablet (M1 iPad Air) and a laptop (16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip). Even though these banks can charge multiple devices at once, I refilled one at a time, to make side-by-side comparisons more straightforward. I drained the batteries of the phones and tablets to between zero and five percent and then didn’t use any device as it refilled. For the MacBook, I let it run down to 10 percent before plugging in the power bank. That's when most laptops give display a “connect to power” warning, as draining any battery to empty will compromise the battery life. I then used it as one might in a mobile office, with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, while connected to Wi-Fi and a VPN. For each test, I noted how long a completely charged battery took to get a device back to full and how much of the battery’s capacity was used up in one charge. I also noted things like portability, apparent durability, helpful features and overall design. For reference, here are the battery capacities of the devices I used: iPhone 15: 3,349mAh Galaxy S23 Ultra: 4,855mAh iPad Air (5th gen): 7,729mAh 16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAh Other laptop power banks we tested HyperJuice 245W Hyper’s HyperJuice 245W brick looks great and has a hefty 27,000mAh capacity. The four USB-C ports can combine to output 245W of power and it got my MacBook Pro from nearly dead to 75 percent before depleting itself. When testing it with a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, the handset got back up to a full charge in just over an hour. The screen tells you what each port is doing as well as displaying the amount of charge remaining in the pack itself. But the lack of port variety makes it feel less versatile than other picks on this list — the price is higher than our other options, too. Laptop power bank FAQs How do laptop power banks differ from phone power banks? The main difference is size. Phone power banks tend to have a capacity ranging from 5,000mAh to 20,000mAh and laptop powerbanks are typically rated between 20,000mAh and 27,000mAh. There’s no official definition, however. Laptop batteries are simply larger and need a bigger supply of power to give them a meaningful charge. How do you fast charge a power bank? You can charge a power bank exactly as fast as the power bank’s internal mechanisms will allow. Most batteries are limited in how quickly they can accept and deliver a charge to avoid dangerously overheating. But to make sure you’re charging a bank as quickly as possible, make sure the wall adapter and the USB-C cable you are using have a high wattage rating — using a 5W power brick and a 10W cable will take a lot longer to refill your bank than a 65W wall charger and a 100W cord. What size power bank do I need for a laptop? Look for a power bank with a rating of at least 20,000mAh. Slightly smaller batteries may work, but they won’t deliver a significant charge laptops. How many mAh to charge a laptop? A milliamp hour (mAh) is how much a battery can hold, and most portable batteries list their capacity using mAh. If you get a battery rated at 20,000mAh or above, it should be able to charge your laptop. Using mAh to discuss laptop batteries can be confusing. Due to differing voltages, you can’t directly compare the mAh ratings of a power bank battery to a laptop battery. Using watt-hours is a better gauge, as that calculation takes voltage into account.

When testing it with a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, the handset got back up to a full charge in just over an hour. The screen tells you what each port is doing as well as displaying the amount of charge remaining in the pack itself. But the lack of port variety makes it feel less versatile than other picks on this list — the price is higher than our other options, too. Laptop power bank FAQs How do laptop power banks differ from phone power banks? The main difference is size. Phone power banks tend to have a capacity ranging from 5,000mAh to 20,000mAh and laptop powerbanks are typically rated between 20,000mAh and 27,000mAh. There’s no official definition, however. Laptop batteries are simply larger and need a bigger supply of power to give them a meaningful charge. How do you fast charge a power bank? You can charge a power bank exactly as fast as the power bank’s internal mechanisms will allow. Most batteries are limited in how quickly they can accept and deliver a charge to avoid dangerously overheating. But to make sure you’re charging a bank as quickly as possible, make sure the wall adapter and the USB-C cable you are using have a high wattage rating — using a 5W power brick and a 10W cable will take a lot longer to refill your bank than a 65W wall charger and a 100W cord. What size power bank do I need for a laptop? Look for a power bank with a rating of at least 20,000mAh. Slightly smaller batteries may work, but they won’t deliver a significant charge laptops. How many mAh to charge a laptop? A milliamp hour (mAh) is how much a battery can hold, and most portable batteries list their capacity using mAh. If you get a battery rated at 20,000mAh or above, it should be able to charge your laptop. Using mAh to discuss laptop batteries can be confusing. Due to differing voltages, you can’t directly compare the mAh ratings of a power bank battery to a laptop battery. Using watt-hours is a better gauge, as that calculation takes voltage into account.

Added a section about other batteries we tested.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-laptop-power-bank-120040388.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Black Friday has brought a solid discount to one of DJI’s most accessible drones. The DJI Neo is now $159 for Prime members, which is 20 percent off its typical $200 price and a strong pickup for first-time flyers. The DJI Neo was recently pushed off our list of the best drones in favor of the newer Neo 2, but the original is still a fantastic, budget-friendly option. We called it the \"best $200 drone ever made\" in our official review, and with good reason. It's quick, ultra-maneuverable and beginner-friendly. The learning curve here isn't that steep. It boasts four propeller guards, for safety, and the built-in 4K camera certainly gets the job done. It's extremely light, weighing just 135 grams. This makes it easy to transport, sure, but also means that the Neo is exempt from drone license requirements. This version doesn't ship with a dedicated controller, though there is a combo pack for that, but that doesn't really matter here. The Neo can be maneuvered by hand gestures, human voice, mobile app or standard RC controller.

It can also connect to gaming PCs and stream gameplay to Chromecast and AirPlay devices. Despite being relatively inexpensive, the 3S offers a great experience.

          "standfirst": "The Apple MacBook Air M4 laptop just hit a new low at Amazon. The base model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is now on sale for $749, dropping below its usual $799 sale price and hitting its best discount since launch. The higher-capacity 512GB version is also seeing a major cut at $949, down from its $1,199 Apple Store price. The MacBook Air M4 continues Apple’s streak of refining what’s already its most popular laptop. It runs on the new M4 chip with a 10-core GPU, offering fast performance for everyday work, creative apps and light gaming. The upgrade from the M3 model is noticeable in both speed and efficiency, making it ideal for multitasking or editing photos and videos on the go. Despite the power boost, it keeps the same slim profile that helped define the MacBook Air line. The unibody design is still one of the thinnest and lightest in its class, weighing just under three pounds, with a durable aluminum chassis available in four colors — midnight, starlight, silver and space gray. The fanless build keeps it completely silent during use, even when running intensive tasks. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display supports the P3 wide color gamut and reaches up to 500 nits of brightness, making text and images look crisp and vibrant whether you’re working indoors or near a window. You also get a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, a three-mic array for clear video calls and a four-speaker setup with Spatial Audio support. Connectivity includes two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, a MagSafe 3 charging port and a headphone jack. Battery life remains one of its standout features, with Apple rating it at up to 18 hours on a single charge. That easily covers a full day of work or travel without reaching for the charger. There are a few small limitations, like the lack of a high refresh rate display and the fact that both USB-C ports sit on the same side. Still, for most users, the MacBook Air M4 strikes the best balance between power, portability and price. If you want a larger screen, Apple’s 15-inch MacBook Air M4 offers the same specs with more workspace, but the 13-inch remains the best pick for portability.

You can get a Sling Orange Day Pass for just $1 through November 30, and get access to 34 channels, including ESPN, ESPN 2 and ESPN 3. Besides ESPN, the Sling Orange Day Pass includes access to TNT and TBS, which makes it a solid option if you're trying to watch the NBA, NFL or college sports. The pass also includes children's channels like Disney Channel and Nick Jr., CNN for news and HGTV and Food Network for purer forms of lean back entertainment. Sling TV is Engadget's pick for the best customizable live streaming service for a reason: You can add on extra premium channels when you buy a pass, and their price will be prorated for whatever length you choose. That way even if a dollar isn't getting you all the channels you need, you don't need to pay that much more to get them. It's worth noting, while this promotion runs during Thanksgiving in the US, a Sling Orange subscription won't get you access to the football games scheduled for that Thursday. To watch those, you'll need at least a Sling Blue subscription, which includes FS1 and NFL Network, but isn't available as a day-long pass. A Sling Blue subscription currently starts at $46 a month. Still, for your $1, around $4 off the price Sling TV normally charges, you're getting a deal. Dozens of popular channels, access to Sling TV's DVR feature, and the ability to use your subscription from a smartphone, tablet, the web or your TV. Plus, Sling TV's interface is easy to navigate, which is what you want when you're likely subscribing with one game or show in mind.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-streaming-deal-sling-orange-day-passes-drop-to-1-each-231208658.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Air fryers have earned their spot on countless countertops for good reason. They make it easy to whip up crispy fries, roasted vegetables and even baked treats without dealing with a pot of hot oil or larger, slower appliances. These compact machines use rapid hot air circulation to deliver crunch and flavor with less mess, making them a practical upgrade for busy cooks or anyone looking to simplify weeknight meals.There’s now an air fryer for almost every kitchen setup, from small baskets that handle quick snacks to larger multi-function models that can roast, reheat and dehydrate. After testing a range of options, our current top pick is the Instant Vortex Plus air fryer. It offers a balance of power, ease of use and consistent results, making it a standout choice for most households.In this guide, we’ve rounded up the best air fryers available right now, covering a range of sizes and features. Whether you’re upgrading from an older model or buying your first, these picks can help you cook crisp, golden meals without the extra oil or hassle. Table of contents What does an air fryer do? Best air fryers for 2025 Buying guide for air fryers Air fryer pros and cons Best air fryer accessories How to clean an air fryer How to find air fryer recipes How we test air fryers What does an air fryer do? Let’s clear one thing up first: it’s not frying. Not really. Air fryers are more like smaller convection bake ovens, ones that are often pod-shaped. Most work by combining a heating element and fan, which means the hot air can usually better crisp the outside of food than other methods. They often reach higher top temperatures than toaster ovens – which is part of the appeal. For most recipes, a thin layer of oil (usually sprayed) helps to replicate that fried look and feel better. However, it will rarely taste precisely like the deep-fried or pan frying version when it comes out of the air fryer basket. Don’t let that put you off, though, because the air fryer, in its many forms, combines some of the best parts of other cooking processes and brings them together into an energy-efficient way of air fryer cooking dinner. Or breakfast. Or lunch. Read more: We’ve also rounded up the best pizza ovens and the best sous vide machines. Best air fryers for 2025 Buying guide for air fryers Convection ovens You can separate most of these machines into two types of air fryers, and each has different pros and cons. Convection ovens are usually ovens with air fryer functions and features. They might have higher temperature settings to ensure that food crisps and cooks more like actually fried food. Most convection ovens are larger than dedicated air fryers, defeating some of the purpose of those looking to shrink cooking appliance surface area. Still, they are often more versatile with multiple cooking functions, and most have finer controls for temperatures, timings and even fan speed. You may never need a built-in oven if you have a decent convection oven. They often have the volume to handle roasts, entire chickens or tray bakes, and simply cook more, capacity-wise, making them more versatile than the pod-shaped competition. The flip side of that is that you’ll need counter space in the kitchen to house them. It also means you can use traditional oven accessories, like baking trays or cake tins, that you might already own. Pod-shaped air fryers Pod-shaped air fryers are what you imagine when you think “air fryer.” They look like a cool, space-age kitchen gadget, bigger than a kettle but smaller than a toaster oven. Many use a drawer to hold ingredients while cooking, usually a mesh sheet or a more solid, non-stick tray with holes to allow the hot air to circulate. With a few exceptions, most require you to open the drawer while things cook and flip or shake half-cooked items to ensure the even distribution of heat and airflow to everything. That’s one of a few caveats. This type of air fryer typically doesn't have a window to see how things are cooking (with only a few exceptions), so you’ll need to closely scrutinize things as they cook, opening the device to check progress. Basket-style air fryers also generally use less energy – there’s less space to heat – and many have parts that can be put directly into a dishwasher. Some of the larger pod-shaped air fryers offer two separate compartments, which is especially useful for anyone planning to cook an entire meal with the appliance. You could cook a couple of tasty chicken wings or tenders while simultaneously rustling up enough frozen fries or veggies for everyone. Naturally, those options take up more space, and they’re usually heavy enough to stop you from storing them in cupboards or shelves elsewhere. As mentioned earlier, you might have to buy extra things to make these pod fryers work the way you want them to. Some of the bigger manufacturers, like Philips and Ninja, offer convenient additions, but you’ll have to pay for them. Air fryer pros and cons Beyond the strengths and weaknesses of individual models, air fryers are pretty easy to use from the outset. Most models come with a convenient cooking time booklet covering most of the major foods you’ll be air frying, so even beginners can master these machines. One of the early selling points is the ability to cook fries, wings, frozen foods and other delights with less fat than other methods like deep frying, which gets foods the crispiest. As air fryers work by circulating heated air, the trays and cooking plates have holes that can also let oil and fat drain out of meats, meaning less fat and crisper food when you finally plate things up. For most cooking situations, you will likely need to lightly spray food with vegetable oil. If you don’t, there’s the chance that things will burn or char. The oil will keep things moist on the surface, and we advise refreshing things with a dash of oil spray when you turn items during cooking. Most air fryers are easy to clean – especially in comparison to a shallow or deep fryer. We’ll get into cleaning guidance a little later. With a smaller space to heat, air fryers are generally more energy-efficient for cooking food than larger appliances like ovens. And if you don’t have an oven, air fryers are much more affordable – especially the pod options. There are, however, some drawbacks. While air fryers are easy enough to use, they take time to master. You will adjust cooking times for even the simplest types of food – like chicken nuggets, frozen French fries or brussels sprouts. If you’re the kind of person that loves to find inspiration from the internet, in our experience, you can pretty much throw their timings out of the window. There are a lot of air fryer options, and factors like how fast they heat and how well distributed that heat is can – and will – affect cooking. There’s also a space limitation to air fryers. This is not a TARDIS – there’s simply less space than most traditional ovens and many deep fat fryers. If you have a bigger family, you’ll probably want to go for a large capacity air fryer – possibly one that has multiple cooking areas. You also might want to consider a different kitchen appliance, like a multicooker, sous vide or slow cooker to meet your specific cooking needs. You may also struggle to cook many items through as the heat settings will cook the surface of dishes long before it’s cooked right through. If you’re planning to cook a whole chicken or a roast, please get a meat thermometer! Best air fryer accessories Beyond official accessories from the manufacturer, try to pick up silicone-tipped tools. Tongs are ideal, as is a silicon spatula to gently loosen food that might get stuck on the sides of the air fryer. These silicone mats will also help stop things from sticking to the wire racks on some air fryers. They have holes to ensure the heated air is still able to circulate around the food. Silicone trivets are also useful for resting any cooked food on while you sort out the rest of the meal. And if you find yourself needing oil spray, but don’t feel like repeatedly buying tiny bottles, you can decant your favorite vegetable oil into a permanent mister like this. How to clean an air fryer We’re keeping clean up simple here. Yes, you could use power cleaners from the grocery store, they could damage the surface of your air fryer. Likewise, metal scourers or brushes could strip away the non-stick coating. Remember to unplug the device and let it cool completely. Remove the trays, baskets and everything else from inside. If the manufacturer says the parts are dishwasher safe – and you have a dishwasher – the job is pretty much done. Otherwise, hand wash each part in a mixture of warm water, with a splash of Dawn or another strong dish soap. Use a soft-bristled brush to pull away any crumbs, greasy deposits or bits of food stuck to any surfaces. Remember to rinse everything. Otherwise, your next batch of wings could have a mild Dawn aftertaste. Trust us. Take a microfiber cloth and tackle the outer parts and handles that might also get a little messy after repeated uses. This is especially useful for oven-style air fryers – use the cloth to wipe down the inner sides. If Dawn isn’t shifting oily stains, try mixing a small amount of baking soda with enough water to make a paste, and apply that so that it doesn’t seep into any electrical parts or the heating element. Leave it to work for a few seconds before using a damp cloth to pull any greasy spots away. Rinse out the cloth and wipe everything down again, and you should be ready for the next time you need to air fry. How to find air fryer recipes Beyond fries, nuggets and – a revelation – frozen gyoza, there are a few ways to find recipes for air-fried foods. First, we found that the air fryer instruction manuals often have cooking guides and recipe suggestions for you to test out in your new kitchen gadget. The good thing with these is that they were made for your air fryer model, meaning success should be all but guaranteed. They are often a little unimaginative, however. Many of the top recipe sites and portals have no shortage of air fryer recipes, and there’s no harm in googling your favorite cuisine and adding the words “air fryer” on the end of the search string. We’ve picked up some reliable options from Delish, which also has a handy air fryer time converter for changing oven and traditional fryer recipes. BBC Good Food is also worth browsing for some simple ideas, as is NYT Cooking, with the ability to directly search for air fryer suggestions. Aside from that, you can also grab plenty of cookbooks from your local bookshop with lots of recipes that you can use in your favorite air fryer. And if you have a killer recipe or unique use for your air fryer, let us know in the comments. What’s the air fryer equivalent of the Instant Pot cheesecake? We’re ready to try it. How we test air fryers We put each air fryer we test through its paces by cooking a variety of foods in it including raw proteins like fish and chicken, raw vegetables like potatoes and cauliflower and frozen snacks like mozzarella sticks. We attempt to use each cooking method that the machine has pre-programmed, and when possible, follow a couple of recipes in any provided recipe booklets that come with the air fryer. We also clean the cooking basket and all other removable components as many times as possible, and will put those components into a dishwasher if they claim to be dishwasher-safe. We also make note of how loud the machine is when using different cooking settings and how warm the surrounding area becomes.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-air-fryers-133047180.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "After taking a break from the Playdate following Season Two and the wonderfully weird experience that was Blippo+, I finally dusted off my little yellow console this week and dove back in. And what better place to start than with a couple of games about cheese? Cheese 'n Crackers and Say When! both hit the Playdate Catalog recently, but aside from the thematic similarity, they're two very different games. As an extra treat (unrelated to cheese), I also picked up Ware-wolf Campfire Stories, a free game on itch.io that's actually over a dozen bite-sized games in one. Cheese 'n CrackersWhen it comes to snacking, everyone's got their preferences. Some crave a savory blast of umami, while for others, a sweet treat might be what always hits the spot. Or maybe you're like me, and if you have one, it needs to be followed by the other. Creating snacks that hit just right is what Cheese 'n Crackers is all about. In this Playdate game, you have what is essentially a neverending charcuterie board with all the fixins you could imagine. There are meats, cheeses, spreads, spices, vegetables, fruits and various types of crackers and breads to adorn with those toppings. You have to combine ingredients to make the perfect snacks for whatever group you're serving that round. Each group — like the Speed Daters or Grandma's Bridge Club — has a specific set of guidelines that may include favorites, dietary restrictions or aversions to certain tastes. A still from the Playdate game Cheese n Crackers showing a cutting board with various meats, vegetables, cheeses and crackersScenic Route SoftwareWhile pairing ingredients is pretty intuitive, there are specific combinations that will earn you more points, so you'll have to pay attention to descriptions of each food item. Or, you can turn to the Cheese 'n Crackers Compatibility Spreadsheet for all of that information in one place. Yes, that exists, and it's an intimidating work of culinary organization. Toppings will go bad if they sit out for too long, so you won't want to waste too much time scouring the spreadsheet, but it's still a relatively low-pressure game that you can play at your own pace. For the more competitive among us, though, there are leaderboards so you can challenge yourself with scores to beat. Say When!This is the more intense of our cheese games, with a Root Bear-like structure that sees you tending to a revolving door of restaurant patrons and trying to grate the perfect amount of cheese for their meals using the crank. And despite being called Say When!, your customers (very unhelpfully) will not actually say \"when\" to let you know you can stop cranking; you have to pay attention to their unique tells to know when they're satisfied — the twitch of a mustache, a change in facial expression, etc. A still from the Playdate game Say When! showing a man wearing dark sunglasses sitting at a table, with a dish in front of him. Grated cheese is pouring onto the dish from a cheese grater that floats above itSmashtoad StudiosThere's a customer satisfaction meter at the top of the screen that will take hits any time you under- or over-serve cheese, or suffer if you're moving too slowly, and once it's down to the bottom, you're fired. After each shift, you'll be given the choice to use a modifier that can help you out in areas like customer satisfaction or getting the boss off your back. To mix things up, there are also mini-games that pop up in the middle of your shift. You might be furiously grating cheese and then have to switch gears and save the life of a choking customer, for example. It's fast-paced, it's silly and it's pretty hard to put down once you get going. Ware-wolf Campfire StoriesWhile the Playdate Catalog has lots of great titles to choose from, there are plenty of gems not on there that are worth checking out too. One such example is Ware-wolf Campfire Stories, a unique package of 14 tiny games that's free on itch.io. It's the result of a collaboration between 15 developer teams — including the developers of Off-Planet Dreams, the Life's Too Short series, Voidblazers and other popular Playdate titles.Per the description:In Ware-wolf Campfire Stories, 5 kids are sitting around a fire with their counselor telling spoooooky tales! Each story launches a separate game that you may win or lose.... with consequences.It's a cool format, and there's some nice variety among the games, which each only take a few minutes to get through for the most part. They're all of the spooky sort, so expect bats, ghosts and skeletons galore. It's a nice way to get a taste of some of the many different game styles you'll encounter on the Playdate, and maybe discover some developers whose games you haven't yet checked out.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/two-playdate-games-about-cheese-and-spooky-campfire-stories-with-a-twist-232516706.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "I love locking in a cheap subscription deal during a discount period like Black Friday or Cyber Monday. It always feels like I've gotten away with something — for the rest of the year, I can relax in my Scrooge McDuck money pit while all the other losers are paying full price. On this list, I've gathered the top subscriptions of all sorts you can enjoy this Black Friday, from VPNs that keep you anonymous online to MasterClass deals that continue your education with thrilling celebrity-led courses. Grab your favorites and join me in the money pit (actual swimming not advised). Best Black Friday subscription deals Quicken Simplifi (one year) for $36 (50 percent off): We named Quicken Simplifi the best budgeting app this year largely because it lives up to its name. This is the cleanest budgeting app on the market, with an interface designed to welcome newcomers and no key information more than a scroll away. It's also cheap, especially with this Black Friday deal, and very good at detecting and categorizing your important transactions. Monarch Money (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): Monarch Money, our other favorite budgeting app, is giving new users half off for Black Friday. It's a little more complex than Quicken Simplifi, but it also gives you finer-grained control, including detailed reporting, balance sheets and instant graphs. The standout goals feature lets you establish savings and wealth baselines that feel amazing when you hit them. Rosetta Stone Lifetime Unlimited subscription for $149 (60 percent off): Rosetta Stone was pioneering visual language courses back when software still came in boxes, and it's still one of the best language learning apps. Today, its method works as well as ever, with patient learning based on pictures, terms and recordings. This deal gets you a full lifetime subscription with access to all 25 languages in the library. Audible (three months) for $3 (80 percent off): For literally $1 per month, you can get access to Audible's enormous library of published audiobooks, podcasts and Audible Originals (which can be anything from never-before-heard books to live performances). It's only three months, after which you'll have to cancel or renew at the regular price, but an audiobibliophile can cram a lot of listening into 90 days. Headspace (one year) for $35 (50 percent off): Out of all the meditation apps available, Headspace is our favorite. It doesn't just help you relax and de-stress, but also teaches you to practice meditation as a skill, with sessions building on each other in organized courses. There's a massive library of standalone guided meditations with all kinds of instructors, and it's easy to search for the ones that work best for you. This deal gives you half off a full year. Calm Premium (one year) for $40 (50 percent off): Once you've finished your Headspace meditation, head over to Calm for every other stress-relieving activity you can think of. This packed subscription gives you a huge library of relaxing content, from music and restful soundscapes to its popular \"sleep stories\" with celebrity narrators telling bedtime stories for children and adults alike. If you've ever wanted to be lulled to sleep by Harry Styles, Matthew McConaughey or Idris Elba, this app is for you. 1Password (one year) for $24 (50 percent off): Using a password manager is one of the most important cybersecurity steps you can take right now. 1Password generates strong, unique passwords for every account, then saves them to autofill when you need them. We named it the best password manager in honor of its well-designed user interface and cross-platform compatibility. DeleteMe (all services) for 30 percent off with code BFCM30OFF25: DeleteMe scrubs your information from people search sites and other public-facing data brokers, dramatically reducing your online presence. It's a time-saving and user-friendly automation of a Since using it monthly, we've noticed a sharp decrease in the amount of spam emails, texts and calls to our personal addresses. Adobe Creative Cloud (one year) for $420 (50 percent off): Creative Cloud is Adobe's most comprehensive design package, including InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere and over 20 other apps. Whip up a website with Dreamweaver, paint on a digital canvas with Fresco or edit photos in Lightroom. It's a pretty steep cost for an individual, but puts a one-year subscription well within reach of a creative business. Best Black Friday streaming deals Apple TV+ (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Sling TV Orange Day Pass for $1 (80 percent off): Sling TV is one of the best live streaming services, and has one of streaming TV's most unique deals: a commitment-free day pass that lets you stream whatever you want for 24 hours, including cable channels and exclusive sports. Normally, a day pass costs $5, but this Black Friday deal knocks that all the way down to $1. Plex (lifetime pass) for $150 (40 percent off): Plex offers personal media servers you can use to organize your digital collection — imagine your own curated Netflix homepage that nothing ever vanishes from. It's also a streaming platform in its own right, with movies and TV from all genres and eras. Plex did just raise its prices, so now's your chance to get a lifetime pass for close to what it used to cost. Walmart+ (one year) for $49 (50 percent off): No, Walmart hasn't started its own streaming platform, but it would probably have some pretty great drama. What you do get with Walmart+ is free shipping on carts over $35, exclusive deals, drone delivery in some cities and more. And if you did come here for streaming, Walmart+ also comes with your choice of Peacock Premium of Paramount+ Essential (we recommend Peacock Premium because it's more expensive on its own). Best VPN deals for Black Friday ExpressVPN Basic (15 months) for $52.39 (73 percent off): ExpressVPN may be the most user-friendly VPN for sale right now, with fast download speeds (only 7 percent losses in our last test), quick connections and apps designed to stay out of your way. It's not the most feature-rich, but it excels at any bread-and-butter VPN task, staying leak-free and unblocking Netflix everywhere. You also get access to server locations in 105 countries. Surfshark Starter (27 months) for $53.73 (87 percent off): According to the tests we ran for our latest review, Surfshark is the fastest VPN right now, with its download speeds, upload speeds and latencies all beating out competitors. It has more to offer beyond speed, too, as it's able to constantly rotate your IP address and generate double VPN paths between any two servers you choose. NordVPN Basic (27 months) for $80.73 (74 percent off): NordVPN got very positive marks in our last review, where we called out its fast internet speeds, wide network of server locations and selection of exclusive features. It comes with a range of dedicated servers for obfuscation, onion routing, torrenting and more. Plus, it's one of the first VPNs getting a jump on post-quantum encryption. CyberGhost VPN (28 months) for $56.84 (84 percent off): CyberGhost is always cheap — in fact, we named it the best budget VPN — but it's never behaved like an economy option. Its Smart Rules automation controls are the deepest in the industry, and its server network reaches 100 countries. Speeds are also quite good, though connections occasionally take a moment to establish. Private Internet Access VPN (40 months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Although we weren't wholly positive about Private Internet Access (PIA VPN) in our recent review, we can't deny it's a worthwhile choice for an affordable VPN. Although speeds can fluctuate, it comes with lots of desirable features on all platforms, like port forwarding (which makes torrents more stable) and two kinds of split tunneling.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/black-friday-subscription-deals-2025-early-sales-on-apple-tv-masterclass-fubo-rosetta-stone-and-more-180000334.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Robot vacuums can be a huge help, keeping your floors clean regularly without much extra work on your part. Black Friday deals often include some of our favorite robovacs, and this year is shaping up to be no different. iRobot's entry-level Roomba 104 Vac robot vacuum is available for 40 percent off right now, bringing it down to a record low of $150. A number of other Roombas are on sale for Black Friday, too. In iRobot's lineup of robot vacuums, the Roomba 104 sits on the low end, adept at vacuuming up dust and hair, but without the mopping ability of its more expensive Max, Plus or Combo counterparts. The Roomba 104 Vac makes for a great first robot vacuum all the same, though, because of its four levels of powerful suction, and easy-to-use app. Like iRobot's other vacuums, the Roomba 104 maps and navigates your home with LiDAR, which helps it avoid obstacles. And using the Roomba Home app, you can schedule it to clean specific rooms, and even spot-clean particularly dirty spots. An earlier version of the Roomba Vac is Engadget's favorite budget robot vacuum, and you'll get the same great performance out of the newer Roomba 104 Vac. That includes a specialized brush for cleaning the hard-to-reach corners of your home, and also a charging dock that the vacuum can automatically return to once it's down charging. This sale on Roomba vacuums comes at an admittedly difficult time for iRobot at large, with the company dealing with a serious financial shortfall as of its last earning statement. Regardless of what happens to iRobot, though, the Roomba 104 Vac's offline mode should mean that it can clean your home and charge itself without the need of an app or an internet connection.

          "content": "Robot vacuums can be a huge help, keeping your floors clean regularly without much extra work on your part. Black Friday deals often include some of our favorite robovacs, and this year is shaping up to be no different. iRobot's entry-level Roomba 104 Vac robot vacuum is available for 40 percent off right now, bringing it down to a record low of $150. A number of other Roombas are on sale for Black Friday, too. In iRobot's lineup of robot vacuums, the Roomba 104 sits on the low end, adept at vacuuming up dust and hair, but without the mopping ability of its more expensive Max, Plus or Combo counterparts.

The reMarkable 2 in particular offers a great reading and writing experience, with support for Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox. It's easy to use and the screen looks great. The battery lasts around two weeks, which is one of the benefits of this type of display. It supports Wi-Fi and can integrate both PDFs and ePub files. It's also easy to create your own notebooks that keep track of handwritten notes. To that end, there are eight brush types here to mark up documents and take notes. The only major downside of the reMarkable 2 is that it doesn't ship with the company's newest Marker Plus stylus. However, this sale lessens that concern. A bundle with the tablet, the Marker Plus and the most simple case costs around $458, whereas the tablet by itself typically costs $399.

For Black Friday, you can save on Oura ring models. Arguably the most noteworthy deal is on the Oura Ring 4, the latest model, which is down to $249. The Ring 4 actually topped our list of the best smart rings, and with good reason. It's comfortable to wear for long periods of time, which is always nice. It's a visually striking ring. We also appreciated the size options, as it fits fingers from size 4 to 15. As for functionality, this smart ring tracks a number of health and fitness metrics. The affiliated app will send out notifications when it thinks you need a rest or to remind you to exercise. It keeps an eye on sleep, heart rate, stress, body temperature, menstrual cycle and a whole lot more. The battery lasts around a week, which is always nice when taking a quick vacation. The only downside here, and this applies to all Oura rings, is that many features are locked behind a subscription paywall. This costs $6 a month or $70 per year. The company is also selling the gold version of the Ring 4 for $349, which is a discount of $50. The water-resistant Stealth Oura Ring 4 is down to $299, which is a discount of $100.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/oura-black-friday-deals-get-up-to-30-percent-off-smart-rings-right-now-123010434.html?src=rss",

This isn't a record low price, but it's extremely close. For the uninitiated, the Echo Spot is a diminutive little speaker/alarm clock hybrid unit. It's a cute little doodad and looks great on a nightstand. The screen is customizable, so it doesn't have to display a clock. It can show song titles, smart home control dashboards, the weather and a lot more. Of course, there are numerous clock faces to choose from. The Spot not only integrates with Amazon's smart assistant Alexa, but it provides access to the newfangled Alexa+. This is a smarter and more conversational version of the iconic smart assistant. Like most modern AI products, it's still working out some bugs. The underlying tech, however, is promising. The speaker is decent enough for the size, though you won't be using it to fuel any house parties. It's a great tool for bedroom-based listening. This version doesn't have a camera, which is actually great news for the privacy conscious. In addition to the Echo Spot, you'll even find Black Friday deals on some of the latest Echo devices that just came out last month. The Echo Dot Max is on sale for $90, the new Echo Studio has dropped to $190 and the latest Echo Show 8 has been discounted to $160.

It’s one of the best 32-inch gaming monitors on the market, combining stunning picture quality with ultra-smooth performance. The 32-inch Odyssey G8 has earned high marks for its blend of image quality and gaming performance. Its 4K OLED panel produces deep blacks and bright highlights, with 99 percent DCI-P3 color coverage for vibrant visuals. The 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time deliver exceptional smoothness in fast-paced games, while AMD FreeSync Premium Pro keeps everything tear-free. Design-wise, it’s sleek and minimal, with a slim metal frame that looks just as good in a work setup as it does in a gaming room. The monitor supports DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.1 inputs, plus USB-C connectivity for charging and data transfer. Built-in speakers and Smart TV features let you stream directly from apps like Netflix or Prime Video without connecting to a PC or console. You also get Samsung’s SmartThings integration, so the Odyssey G8 can double as a smart home hub, controlling compatible IoT devices from lights to thermostats. It even supports cloud gaming through Xbox Game Pass and NVIDIA GeForce Now, meaning you can play high-end titles without extra hardware. The combination of OLED contrast, motion clarity and built-in streaming makes it one of the most versatile monitors in Samsung’s lineup. If you want something even larger, the Odyssey G9 is also discounted by $300, bringing the 49-inch curved DQHD model down to $700. It offers a wide field of view and 144Hz refresh rate, making it a great pick for simulation and racing fans. The Odyssey G7 is another strong choice, now $600 after a $300 discount. This 37-inch 4K display runs at 165Hz with a curved design and supports both HDR and AMD FreeSync for smooth gameplay. Finally, Samsung’s Smart Monitor M9 is available for $1,300, $300 off its regular price. It combines 4K OLED visuals with built-in streaming and AI-powered vision tools, making it a good all-rounder for work and entertainment.

          "standfirst": "If you’ve been waiting to grab a new iPad at a lower price, this might be the time. The iPad A16 is on sale for $279 thanks to Black Friday, which is a solid drop from its usual list price. It’s the best budget tablet in Apple’s lineup and a great pick for streaming, note-taking or browsing without spending Pro-level money. Apple’s latest 11-inch iPad uses the A16 chip, the same processor found in the iPhone 15, delivering fast and reliable performance for most tasks. Whether you’re watching videos, editing documents or using creative apps, it feels responsive and capable. The A16 chip also helps future-proof the device, ensuring it stays compatible with new iPadOS updates for years. The tablet’s 11-inch Liquid Retina display (2360 x 1640) offers sharp detail and vivid color at up to 500 nits of brightness. While it doesn’t have the ultra-bright XDR panel of the iPad Pro, it’s more than crisp enough for streaming or sketching with the Apple Pencil. The design follows Apple’s familiar flat-edge style, with slim bezels and an aluminum build that keeps it light and durable. The iPad includes a 12MP rear camera and a 12MP front-facing Center Stage camera, which automatically adjusts to keep you in frame during video calls. The front camera is positioned along the longer landscape edge, which gives a more natural angle for calls or recordings. You also get Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C for charging and data transfer, plus Touch ID built into the top button. Battery life runs up to 10 hours on Wi-Fi, which is consistent with Apple’s other models. Accessory support covers the Apple Pencil (USB-C) and the first-generation Apple Pencil with the USB-C adapter, along with the Magic Keyboard Folio. It doesn’t work with the Apple Pencil Pro, but for casual drawing, note-taking or quick document markup, these accessories add plenty of flexibility. The A16 iPad sits at the entry point of Apple’s lineup, but it shares a lot of what makes its pricier siblings appealing. You get a polished display, dependable performance and the familiarity of iPadOS without the premium cost. It’s an ideal choice for students, casual users or anyone who wants a reliable tablet for daily use. If you’re still deciding which model fits you best, check out our guide to the best iPads to compare the A16 against the Air and Pro models. At $279, this iPad deal offers excellent value for Apple’s newest entry-level tablet. Also on sale for Black Friday is the 11-inch iPad Air M3, which is down to $449.

          "standfirst": "The AirPods Pro 3 are now on sale for $220, marking the biggest discount since launch. That’s a solid price for Apple’s newest earbuds, which bring improved sound, longer battery life and upgraded noise cancellation in a familiar, comfortable design. Previously, the lowest we saw Apple’s AirPods Pro 3 go down to was $239. This is a deal worth considering, as we can’t guarantee they’ll be discounted further anytime soon. Apple didn’t reinvent its flagship earbuds with the AirPods Pro 3, but it made smart refinements that elevate nearly every part of the listening experience. We praised these earbuds in our AirPods Pro 3 review for delivering noticeably richer audio and more effective active noise cancellation while keeping the same pocketable form factor that made earlier models so popular. The standout upgrade here is Apple’s Live Translation feature, which was an unexpected but welcome surprise, announced at the iPhone 17 event. Leveraging Apple’s H2 chip, the AirPods Pro 3 combines Voice Isolation, ANC and beamforming mics to kick Live Translation into action. Siri’s translation filters seamlessly through the earbuds, but if environmental noise gets too intrusive, you can view a real-time transcription in the iOS Translate app, which is a useful feature for international travel and business calls. Battery life has improved, too. You get up to eight hours on a single charge with ANC on, and the case adds another 24 hours of playback. The MagSafe charging case, with its new U2 chip, now supports an increased distance for Precision Find My, so it’s easier to locate if misplaced. Since we’re talking about earbuds, audio quality plays a key role in deciding whether to purchase the AirPods Pro 3 or upgrade from a previous model. Although improvements have been made to sound quality through new drivers and transducers, Apple’s decision to increase air flow inside the earbuds has been the most noticeable update. You can expect the AirPods Pro 3 to deliver deeper bass, crisper highs, and an expanded soundstage that makes everything from podcasts to orchestral tracks feel more dynamic. There’s not much to fault here beyond the familiar Apple premium price, but that’s why this AirPods Pro 3 deal is such good news. The AirPods Pro 3 remain the best wireless earbuds for iPhone users who want seamless connectivity, top-tier ANC and reliable comfort. But if you were hoping to spend a little less, the AirPods 4 with ANC are on sale for $100 right now as well, and the standard AirPods 4 are down to $80.

          "title": "The best Black Friday TV deals from Samsung, LG, Roku, TCL and others include some of this year's lowest prices",
          "standfirst": "Generally speaking, there are two ideal periods to buy a TV: the late spring stretch when new models are announced and last year’s sets are heavily discounted to clear out inventory, and the holiday shopping season, right around Black Friday. We’re firmly in the latter right now, so if you’ve been thinking about making that big living room upgrade, it’s safe to take the plunge. To help you out, we’ve sorted through the many sales floating around the web and picked out the best Black Friday TV deals we could find below. The current selection covers several well-reviewed sets from Samsung, LG, Hisense and other popular brands, but we’ll update this post as more noteworthy deals pop up. Best Black Friday TV deals: Under $500 Hisense U65QF (55-inch) for $428 at Amazon ($372 off MSRP): The U65QF is another entry-level LED TV with generally positive reviews. Most feedback around the web suggests that it can’t match the QM6K in terms of contrast, gaming features and overall accuracy, so TCL’s model should be a better buy for most. This iteration also uses Amazon’s Fire TV platform instead of the cleaner Google TV. It can achieve a higher peak brightness, however, so it’s worth considering if you get particularly bad glare in your living room. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, but the 65-inch ($548), 75-inch ($748) and 85-inch ($998) models are also at all-time lows. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: Between $500 and $1,000 TCL QM7K (65-inch) for $798 at Amazon ($202 off): The TCL QM7K is a fairly sizable step up over the QM6K, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz@1080p support as well, though like the budget model it’s limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. And like most LED TVs, it can’t compete with a good OLED set when it comes to colors and viewing angles. This deal matches the all-time low for the 65-inch model. The 55-inch version is $30 above its previous best at $598. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. LG B5 (55-inch) for $897 at Amazon ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025. It gets you the core benefits of any OLED TV — excellent contrast, wide viewing angles, smooth motion and so on — but it can’t get as bright as the higher-end LG C5, so it doesn’t look as colorful. (The C5 isn’t significantly discounted as of this writing.) It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz, too, though that isn’t a big deal unless you plan to play PC games on your TV. While not huge discount, this matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Hisense U75QG (55-inch) for $528 at Amazon ($386 off): The Hisense U75QG is a close competitor to the QM7K. Its main advantage is that it can get much brighter than TCL’s model, which can make HDR content look more dynamic. This set also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two, which is nice for those with multiple game consoles and a soundbar. That said, some reviews say its contrast falls short of the QM7K and that it can make HDR content too bright to be fully accurate. It also suffers from more noticeable motion blur, which means it's not the best choice for fast-paced games. So you may only want to grab it if you’re determined to stay in this price range and have your TV in an especially bright room. Nevertheless, this is the best price we’ve seen for the 55-inch set. The same goes for the 65-inch ($748) and 75-inch ($998) models. Also at Best Buy. Best Black Friday TV deals: $1,000 and up Samsung S95F (65-inch) for $2,298 at Amazon ($700 off): The S95F is a premium model that's received almost universally stellar reviews for being especially bright among OLED TVs while keeping the bold colors and contrast expected from a QD-OLED panel. That brightness, combined with the display’s matte finish, means it’s uniquely adept at fending off glare. It also has four HDMI 2.1 ports and a native 165Hz refresh rate for gaming. That said, there’s still no Dolby Vision HDR, and the matte coating means that black tones won’t look as deep in a bright room. It's not cheap, but this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Samsung and Best Buy. LG G5 (65-inch) for $1,997 at Amazon ($400 off): The LG G5 is the S95F’s chief rival at the top of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter, it does support Dolby Vision and its glossy finish means it won’t lose those inky blacks under ambient light. It’s more susceptible to glare, however, and while its picture is a level above most WOLED TVs, it’s still a step behind QD-OLED sets like the S95F when it comes to color volume. But if you’re mostly going to watch things away from direct light, this might be the better buy. This deal has technically been live for a few weeks, but it matches the lowest price we’ve seen for the 65-inch model. Also at Best Buy and LG. Best Black Friday streaming device deals Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you want a cheaper stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you just prefer Roku’s app-based UI, which many find simpler to navigate than the alternatives from Google and Amazon. Performance is fine, if not super-fast, and the device supports Apple AirPlay as well. Just expect to see some ads and know there’s no Twitch app. This deal matches the stick’s all-time low. Also at Best Buy and B&H. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $19 at Amazon ($21 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is a cheaper version of the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender included. It may be less reliable with choppier internet connections as a result, but it can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port, it can still stream up to 4K, and the software experience is identical. Most people should probably just spend the extra $5 for the Streaming Stick 4K, but if you’re really looking to save, the Plus is a decent value. This deal is a new all-time low. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Roku Ultra for $69 at Amazon ($31 off): The Ultra might be worth it if you want the Roku experience in a set-top box design with built-in Ethernet and USB ports. Unlike the streaming sticks, it comes bundled with a rechargeable remote that supports voice controls, a lost remote finding tool and backlit buttons. (Though you can buy that separately.) This latest model also has a faster processor and Wi-Fi 6 support, though it’s not as snappy as other boxes like the Google TV Streamer 4K or Apple TV 4K. This deal ties the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Plus for $25 at Amazon ($25 off): If you'd prefer one of Amazon's media streamers, the newly rebranded Fire TV Stick 4K Plus offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it has a slightly slower processor, half the storage space (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 support instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people who just want to stream casually, those shouldn’t be huge losses. Just keep in mind that its Fire OS interface is still fairly ad-heavy and prioritizes Amazon’s own apps over everything else. This deal is $3 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in the past year. Also at Best Buy. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want the best Amazon streaming stick possible, the 4K Max gets you faster hardware than the Plus model and may be worthwhile if you have a Wi-Fi 6E router at home. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve seen over the past year. Also at Best Buy and Target. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 at Amazon ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It only streams up to 1080p and runs a bit choppier than Amazon’s 4K models since it has a slower chip and a meager 1GB of RAM. The usual complaints with Fire OS still apply, too. But if you want to stick with Amazon and just need to add streaming apps to an old TV for as little as possible, it’ll work well enough. This discount matches the best price we’ve tracked. Also at Best Buy and Target.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-tv-deals-from-samsung-lg-roku-tcl-and-others-include-some-of-this-years-lowest-prices-181143931.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Black Friday is a banner time to pick up some of the latest gear from Apple for a discount. Engadget has been reviewing Apple’s products for, oh, 20 years or so — this year alone saw us evaluate, among others, the latest-gen AirPods Pro, the new Apple Watches, the iPad Pro M5, the iPad Air M3, a bunch of MacBooks and, of course, all models of the iPhone 17 lineup. Speaking of which, you won’t see iPhone deals represented here — service and contract-related discounts tend to make those savings a little too specific. But if you want to save on AirPods, iPads, MacBooks, accessories or other Apple gear, look no further. These are the best Black Friday Apple deals we could find. Apple Black Friday deals: AirPods AirPods 4 (with ANC) for $100 ($79 off) at Amazon: If you just need moderate noise cancellation and prefer an open-wear fit (where nothing goes in your ear canal), you may prefer the new AirPods 4. They don’t have heart rate sensing or the hearing features the Pro models have. But we found the sound quality to be pretty good and appreciated Pro-level features like live translation. Also at Walmart and $140 at Best Buy. AirPods 4 (no ANC) for $80 ($50 off) at Amazon: You miss out on a few more features on the base-model AirPods 4: no live translation, no noise cancellation and no heart rate sensing, but you do get Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, like on the pricer models. We gave the entry-level buds an 88 in our review. The previous low price was $89. Also available at Walmart and Target. AirPods Max for $430 ($120 off) at Walmart: These cans have been around for quite some time now, only getting the slightest upgrade with a new USB-C port in 2024. The hardware is otherwise the same as it was when the over-ear headphones debuted in 2020. Still, they’re comfortable, have good sound quality and the on-board controls are unique but good. Amazon is selling it for $40 more. EarPods for $17 ($2 off) at Amazon: For those who prefer a cord, here is the only Apple-branded wired earphone option. This is a dollar more than the all-time low. Also at Walmart. Apple Black Friday deals: iPads iPad Air (M3, 11-inch, 128GB) for $449 ($151 off) at Amazon: The Air is the Goldilocks Apple tablet. It strikes the perfect balance between price and performance, making it our overall pick for the best iPad you can buy. The build is lovely; it feels premium and the display is a big improvement over Apple’s base-model slate. The M3 chip is plenty fast for everyday use and can handle an average day of productivity no problem, particularly with its improved multi-tasking abilities. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also on sale at Walmart, Target and Best Buy for a few dollars more. iPad Air (M3, 13-inch, 128GB) for $649 ($150 off) at Amazon: A larger screen will make watching shows and playing games more expansive. And if you use your iPad more like a personal computer, you’ll appreciate the extra real estate for spreading out your work. Like the 11-inch Air, this has a powerful M3 chip and an excellent screen, as well as support for the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Intelligence. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target, Best Buy and it's $100 more at B&H. iPad mini (A17 Pro, 8-inch, 128GB) for $399 ($100 off) at Amazon: The smallest Apple iPad is really meant for those who put a priority on the portability and palm-ability of an 8-inch tablet. It uses the A17 chip, which enables support for Apple Intelligence, unlike the base model iPad. We gave it an 83 in our review, praising the fact that you get the full iPad experience, just in a more compact package. We found it particularly suited to messaging, reading, watching video and playing lots of Balatro. It went as low as $379 in October. Also at Best Buy. iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch, 256GB) for $900 ($100 off) at Amazon: While we think this is an amazing piece of computing machinery, we admit that it’s overkill for most people. It's got one of the best displays you’ll find on a tablet, the most recent M5 chip (the same that powers the base-level Apple MacBook Pro) and an almost impossibly thin and light build. We gave it an 85 in our review and had very few complaints — aside from the near-prohibitive price tag. Hopefully this Black Friday discount helps. This $100 discount is a new all-time low. It's $923 at Walmart. Apple Black Friday deals: Apple Watch Apple Watch Series 11 (42mm, GPS only) for $350 ($49 off) at Amazon: Apple still makes the best smartwatch money can buy. The flagship Apple Watch Series 11 is not just a stalwart companion for an iPhone, it also offers comprehensive health monitoring and fitness tracking. There wasn’t a huge change from the Series 10 to this one — both have the same thin and light design, but now the glass is tougher and the battery lasts longer. This $50 discount is the steepest we've seen yet. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS only) for $200 ($49 off) at Amazon: After a couple years, Apple finally updated its budget-model smart watch. And we were pretty happy with the results, awarding the new wearable a review score of 90. It’s got a smaller screen and thicker bezels than the Series 11 and lacks a few of the more advanced health monitoring features. It’s also made from slightly less-robust materials. But it has nearly everything that makes Apple Watches great for a lot less — particularly now. This is the lowest price we've seen since the watch came out in September. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Black Friday deals: MacBooks and Macs Apple MacBook Air (M4, 15-inch, 256GB) for $949 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M4 chip is quite powerful, to take advantage of all the productivity it enables, you might want a little more room on your screen. When Apple first made a 15-inch option for the MacBook Air a couple generations ago, we were surprised at the difference it made. Also at Best Buy and it's $100 off at B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M5, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,444 ($155 off) at Amazon: Apple’s most recent M-series chip is the M5, and only comes equipped on the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the iPad Pro. When the M5 MacBook Pro M5 came out last month, we promptly reviewed it and awarded it a 92. That new chip gives the laptop an impressive graphics upgrade that helps make it more suited to gaming — an area where Apple still lags behind PCs. Other than the chip upgrade, it’s mostly the same, which is a good thing. It’s sturdy, powerful and has an impressively long battery life — we clocked 34 hours in a video run-down test. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 14-inch, 512GB) for $1,749 ($250 off) at Amazon: The M5 chip isn’t yet available in the Pro and Max variants. If Apple follows the same six-month gap that separated the M4 from the M4 Pro and Max chips, we may see the M5 Pro/Max in spring of next year. For now, however, those higher-specced chips can only be found in the M4-series lineup. The MacBook Pro with the M4 Pro chip is on sale and it’s our recommendation for creative professionals who need an obscene amount of processing power. Also at Walmart, Best Buy and B&H. Apple MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 16-inch, 256GB) for $2,189 ($310 off) at Amazon: You sacrifice a little portability for the larger 16-inch screen, as it adds about a pound and a quarter to the weight. But you might appreciate the extra space for your work on the display. Also at Walmart and B&H. Apple 2024 iMac (M4, 24-inch) for $1,149 ($150 off) at Amazon: Apple just has one model of an all-in-one desktop computer and it has the M4 chip inside. We called the iMac more cost effective than ever, now that it comes with a minimum of 16GB of RAM. The M4 chip makes it capable for content creation, productivity and gaming. Mac mini (M4) for $479 ($120 off) at Amazon: Apple’s compact desktop computer got a rave review from us. We called it \"shockingly small [and] incredibly powerful.” It also benefits from a bump to a minimum of 16GB of internal memory. It can play modern games at reasonable resolutions and handle most productivity tasks you throw at it. Apple Black Friday deals: Accessories Apple Pencil Pro for $99 ($30 off) at Amazon: The Apple Pencil situation is a little messy, so you’ll want to double check which model is compatible with your particular iPad. The Pencil Pro is the most fully featured in the lineup with haptic feedback, barrel roll and squeeze capabilities, and a hover preview feature. It’ll work with the two most recent models of the Air and Pro iPads, as well as the latest iPad mini. Also at Walmart and Best Buy. Apple Pencil USB-C for $69 ($10 off) at Amazon: If you have the new base-model iPad with the A16 chip, this is the pencil that will work for you. It’ll also work with current as well as slightly older models of the Air and Pro iPads. Apple AirTag (4-pack) for $65 ($34 off) at Amazon: Even though they haven’t been updated in a few years, Apple’s AirTags are still the gold standard of Bluetooth trackers, and what most people think of when they think of trackers. We may get a new version soon, but they aren’t likely to be this cheap. Also at Walmart. A single AirTag is on sale too.

          "content": "Black Friday is a banner time to pick up some of the latest gear from Apple for a discount. Engadget has been reviewing Apple’s products for, oh, 20 years or so — this year alone saw us evaluate, among others, the latest-gen AirPods Pro, the new Apple Watches, the iPad Pro M5, the iPad Air M3, a bunch of MacBooks and, of course, all models of the iPhone 17 lineup. Speaking of which, you won’t see iPhone deals represented here — service and contract-related discounts tend to make those savings a little too specific. But if you want to save on AirPods, iPads, MacBooks, accessories or other Apple gear, look no further. These are the best Black Friday Apple deals we could find. Apple Black Friday deals: AirPods AirPods 4 (with ANC) for $100 ($79 off) at Amazon: If you just need moderate noise cancellation and prefer an open-wear fit (where nothing goes in your ear canal), you may prefer the new AirPods 4. They don’t have heart rate sensing or the hearing features the Pro models have. But we found the sound quality to be pretty good and appreciated Pro-level features like live translation. Also at Walmart and $140 at Best Buy. AirPods 4 (no ANC) for $80 ($50 off) at Amazon: You miss out on a few more features on the base-model AirPods 4: no live translation, no noise cancellation and no heart rate sensing, but you do get Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, like on the pricer models. We gave the entry-level buds an 88 in our review. The previous low price was $89. Also available at Walmart and Target. AirPods Max for $430 ($120 off) at Walmart: These cans have been around for quite some time now, only getting the slightest upgrade with a new USB-C port in 2024. The hardware is otherwise the same as it was when the over-ear headphones debuted in 2020. Still, they’re comfortable, have good sound quality and the on-board controls are unique but good. Amazon is selling it for $40 more. EarPods for $17 ($2 off) at Amazon: For those who prefer a cord, here is the only Apple-branded wired earphone option. This is a dollar more than the all-time low. Also at Walmart. Apple Black Friday deals: iPads iPad Air (M3, 11-inch, 128GB) for $449 ($151 off) at Amazon: The Air is the Goldilocks Apple tablet. It strikes the perfect balance between price and performance, making it our overall pick for the best iPad you can buy. The build is lovely; it feels premium and the display is a big improvement over Apple’s base-model slate. The M3 chip is plenty fast for everyday use and can handle an average day of productivity no problem, particularly with its improved multi-tasking abilities. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also on sale at Walmart, Target and Best Buy for a few dollars more. iPad Air (M3, 13-inch, 128GB) for $649 ($150 off) at Amazon: A larger screen will make watching shows and playing games more expansive. And if you use your iPad more like a personal computer, you’ll appreciate the extra real estate for spreading out your work. Like the 11-inch Air, this has a powerful M3 chip and an excellent screen, as well as support for the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Intelligence. This matches the lowest price we've tracked. Also at Target, Best Buy and it's $100 more at B&H. iPad mini (A17 Pro, 8-inch, 128GB) for $399 ($100 off) at Amazon: The smallest Apple iPad is really meant for those who put a priority on the portability and palm-ability of an 8-inch tablet. It uses the A17 chip, which enables support for Apple Intelligence, unlike the base model iPad. We gave it an 83 in our review, praising the fact that you get the full iPad experience, just in a more compact package. We found it particularly suited to messaging, reading, watching video and playing lots of Balatro. It went as low as $379 in October. Also at Best Buy. iPad Pro (M5, 11-inch, 256GB) for $900 ($100 off) at Amazon: While we think this is an amazing piece of computing machinery, we admit that it’s overkill for most people. It's got one of the best displays you’ll find on a tablet, the most recent M5 chip (the same that powers the base-level Apple MacBook Pro) and an almost impossibly thin and light build. We gave it an 85 in our review and had very few complaints — aside from the near-prohibitive price tag. Hopefully this Black Friday discount helps. This $100 discount is a new all-time low. It's $923 at Walmart. Apple Black Friday deals: Apple Watch Apple Watch Series 11 (42mm, GPS only) for $350 ($49 off) at Amazon: Apple still makes the best smartwatch money can buy. The flagship Apple Watch Series 11 is not just a stalwart companion for an iPhone, it also offers comprehensive health monitoring and fitness tracking. There wasn’t a huge change from the Series 10 to this one — both have the same thin and light design, but now the glass is tougher and the battery lasts longer. This $50 discount is the steepest we've seen yet. Also at Walmart and Target. Apple Watch SE 3 (40mm, GPS only) for $200 ($49 off) at Amazon: After a couple years, Apple finally updated its budget-model smart watch. And we were pretty happy with the results, awarding the new wearable a review score of 90. It’s got a smaller screen and thicker bezels than the Series 11 and lacks a few of the more advanced health monitoring features. It’s also made from slightly less-robust materials.

          "standfirst": "If you’re looking to grab a new SSD for a PC, PS5, gaming handheld or any other gadget, Black Friday is typically a good time to take the plunge. To help you separate the fake discounts from the stuff worth your time, we’ve picked through the many sales going on now and rounded up the best Black Friday SSD deals and other storage discounts we could find below. The offers include a handful of well-reviewed SSDs, external drives, microSD cards and more, but we’ll update this post as new standouts pop up. Best Black Friday microSD card deals Lexar Play Pro (256GB) microSD Express card for $49 at Amazon ($11 off MSRP): The only reason to buy a super-fast (but pricey) microSD Express card is to expand the storage of a Nintendo Switch 2, which requires the newer format. In our guide to the best Switch 2 microSD cards, we found each model we tested to perform similarly in actual games, so your best bet is to buy whichever one you can find in stock at the lowest price. Nintendo has already announced that Samsung’s 256GB Express card will be available for “$20 off MSRP” on November 30, which should bring it down to $40. If you can wait to pounce on that offer, you should. But if you can’t for some reason, or if that discount quickly sells out, this is only $2 more than the best price we’ve seen for Lexar’s equivalent model. Samsung P9 Express (512GB) microSD Express Card for $75 at Amazon ($25 off): If you want more space for a Switch 2, the 512GB version of Samsung’s P9 Express microSD Express card is also on sale for a new low of $75. Full disclosure: Samsung launched this card a couple of weeks ago, and we only just got it in for testing. But given the trend of similar Switch 2 performance we’ve seen with other Express cards thus far, and the fact that this is easily the cheapest 512GB model we can find in stock as of this writing, we figure it’s worth noting. Also at Samsung and B&H. SanDisk microSD Express Card (256GB) for $60 at Amazon ($8 off): Like the offers above, this discount matches the best price we’ve seen for SanDisk’s 256GB microSD Express card. Again, there isn’t much point in grabbing it as long as cheaper options are in stock, though this is technically the fastest all-around model we’ve tested when it comes to transferring games to and from the Switch 2’s built-in storage. (Within games, however, the difference is still minimal.) We’ll note it here just in case the other Express models completely sell out. Best Black Friday internal SSD deals SK Hynix Platinum P51 (1TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $110 at Newegg ($60 off): Most people don’t have to pay extra for the top-tier performance of a PCIe 5.0 SSD like the Platinum P51, but if you need something for more intense workloads or just want comfort of owning a more futureproof SSD, reviews around the web suggest this is one of the better options available. Just make sure you have a compatible motherboard and CPU first. This offer ties the lowest price yet for the 1TB model. Use the code BFEFE96 to get the full discount at checkout. Crucial T710 (2TB) PCIe 5.0 SSD for $180 at Best Buy ($120 off): The T710 is Crucial’s successor to the T705. Most reviews suggest it isn’t a massive leap over the older version in real-world performance, but it’s generally quicker, and it’s a more noticeable improvement in terms of power efficiency. If you’re willing to spend a little bit extra, this discount is still within $10 of the best price we’ve seen for the 2TB variant. It’s usually retailed for $230 over the last couple of months. Also at Amazon and B&H. Crucial P310 (2TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $130 at Amazon ($110 off): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can slot in certain thin and light notebooks or gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but most reviews say it performs well for what it is. This discount is a few bucks above the largest drop to date for the 2TB model, but it’s still about $20 off the drive’s usual street price. Also at B&H. Best Black Friday portable SSD deals Crucial X10 (1TB) portable SSD for $85 at Amazon ($13 off): The X10 is a newer iteration of the Crucial X10 Pro, which itself is a variant of the Crucial X9 Pro, the top pick in our guide to the best portable SSDs. It uses the USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 interface, which few PCs and no Macs support, so most people won’t see a difference between it and more traditional USB 3.2 Gen 2 drives like the X9 Pro. (Pricier USB4 and Thunderbolt models, meanwhile, are much faster and generally easier to utilize.) If the X10 is on sale for much less than the X9 Pro, however, there’s little reason to not buy it instead. That’s the case as of this writing. Plus, like our top pick, the X10 is rugged, impressively compact and fast enough for most people’s needs, though it doesn’t support hardware-based encryption. This deal is $3 more than the 1TB model’s all-time low but still $15 off its typical going rate. Other capacities are also on sale, including the extra spacious 8TB model for a new low of $385. Seagate Storage Expansion Card for Xbox (2TB) for $200 at Amazon ($30 off): Annoying as it is, the only way to fully add storage to an Xbox Series X or Series S is to use a proprietary expansion card. Only two of those exist, and they’re both expensive compared to traditional SSDs. Still, they’re dead simple to set up, and this Seagate model holds up well compared to the consoles’ internal storage. White this deal for the 2TB version isn’t an all-time low, it’s about $20 off the card’s usual going rate over the last few months. The 4TB variant is also discounted at $380 — that’s a ton to spend on one of these things, but it does match the lowest price we’ve tracked for that particular model. Also at Best Buy and Walmart.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-black-friday-deals-on-ssds-microsd-cards-and-other-storage-devices-we-could-find-for-2025-175429908.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "If you’ve been waiting to grab a PlayStation 5, this Black Friday deal is worth noting. Sony’s latest consoles are getting a $100 discount across the board, dropping the PS5 Digital Edition to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the PS5 Pro to $649. That’s one of the best prices we’ve seen on Sony’s hardware this year. You'll find the deals direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. Sony’s flagship console remains one of the most popular gaming systems available, and this Black Friday discount makes it even easier to jump in if you haven’t already. The standard PS5 and the slimmer PS5 Digital Edition both offer fast load times, smooth frame rates and crisp visuals powered by the custom AMD Zen 2 processor and RDNA 2 GPU. The difference between them comes down to the disc drive — the standard model includes one, while the Digital Edition relies entirely on digital downloads. For those who want top-tier performance, the PS5 Pro is also getting a rare $100 discount. It features upgraded specs and enhanced ray tracing for sharper graphics, along with improved cooling to handle more demanding titles. Whether you play cinematic single-player hits or fast-paced competitive games, the PS5 lineup remains one of the strongest options on the market for next-gen gaming. Each console supports 4K output, 3D audio and access to PlayStation Plus, which unlocks online multiplayer and a rotating library of free games. The DualSense controller remains a highlight, with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback that make everything from racing to combat feel more immersive. If you’re already set with a console, there are also a few solid accessory deals to consider for Black Friday. The DualSense Wireless Controller is down to $55, a $25 discount available in multiple colors. The premium DualSense Edge controller, which adds customizable buttons and replaceable stick modules, drops to $169 during Black Friday. Meanwhile, the PlayStation Portal — Sony’s portable Remote Player that lets you stream games from your PS5 — gets discounted to $179.

          "standfirst": "Black Friday has become the time to buy the hottest tech of the year. Whether you're shopping for yourself or stocking up on gifts for the holidays, Black Friday deals are sure to bring the best prices of the year to things like headphones, game consoles, robot vacuums, phone accessories and everything in between. You don't even have to wait until Black Friday proper to save a ton of money. Over the past few years, we've seen Black Friday tech deals start earlier and earlier — to the point where the entire month of November is packed with discounts.If you're on the hunt for solid tech deals, Engadget has you covered. We've collected the best Black Friday deals on tech you can get right now, and we'll continue to update this post as we get closer to the big day at the end of November. Note that you probably have the best chance of snagging record-low prices when we get to about one week before Thanksgiving, but these deals available now are worth considering. Black Friday deals: Engadget's top picks Apple AirPods Pro 3 for $220 ($29 off): Apple's latest flagship wireless earbuds are the ones to get if you have an iPhone and any other Apple gear. They have improved sound quality, impressive ANC improvements, extra features like Live Translation and even better battery life. Apple iPad A16 for $279 (20 percent off): Apple's cheapest iPad makes a great first tablet for kids, or anyone who just wants a basic slab for watching videos, online shopping, sending emails and more. It's plenty fast thanks to the A16 chipset that powers it, plus it has a nice screen, 128GB of storage in the base model and good battery life. Apple AirTags (four pack) for $65 (34 percent off): iPhone users who frequently misplace things should invest in a few AirTags. Slip them into your wallet, bag, jacket and other belongings to keep track of their locations in the Find My app. Just make sure that, if you're going to attach one to your keys, you also pick up an AirTag holder to go along with it. Philips fabric shaver for $13 (32 percent off): Consider this the Black Friday tech deal you didn't know you needed. If you have shirts, sweaters, pants, even blankets that have pilled over time, this handy little fabric shaver can get them looking more like new again. I bought this on a whim after wishing I could refresh some of my most-loved wardrobe staples without spending hours pulling pills off myself. Philips' fabric shaver has delivered and then some, and my clothes look much fresher than before. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 (48 percent off): Those who use Alexa often will get the most out of this smart plug. We like that it's super simple to set up and can turn almost anything with an on-off switch \"smart,\" allowing you to control it via your phone or with Alexa voice commands. LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon A New Hope 25th Anniversary Collectable 75375 for $68 (20 percent off): This is a set that any Star Wars fan will love to build and then love to display once it's complete. The 921-piece set features a fully-detailed Millennium Falcone, buildable stand and nameplate. It's one of many Lego Black Friday deals you can get right now. Amazon Kindle Colorsoft (16GB) for $170 ($80 off): The latest color ereader in Amazon's lineup includes a seven-inch, high-contrast display, USB-C charging and a battery life that can last up to eight weeks on a single charge. Its design is waterproof too, so you don't need to baby it if you take it by the pool or to the beach. If you prefer a black-and-white screen, the base Kindle is also on sale for $80. Meta Quest 3S VR headset for $250 ($50 off): We consider this to be the best VR headset for newbies or those on a budget. It's comfortable to wear for long sessions, has solid performance, comes with excellent controllers and you'll have access to a large app library with it. PlayStation 5 Black Friday deals: The PlayStation 5 is getting a major Black Friday discount, with $100 off consoles. That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Black Friday deals under $50 Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 (35 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Anker Nano magnetic power bank (5K, Qi2 15W) for $39 (30 percent off): This ultra-slim battery pack snaps magnetically to the backs of compatible phones to power them up, allowing you to use your device while it's charging. It comes in multiple colors and supports the latest Qi2 charging standard. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $80 (38 percent off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $479 ($120 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Apple iPad Air M3 (11 inch) for $449 (25 percent off): We consider this to be the best iPad for most people thanks to its strong performance, big , sharp display, good battery life, improved multitasking capabilities and its compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro. Black Friday streaming deals and subscription deals MasterClass Black Friday deal — get up to 50 percent off subscriptions: MasterClass is running a limited-time offer that cuts up to 50 percent off all annual subscriptions for Black Friday. The deal gives you access to hundreds of lessons taught by experts and well-known names across nearly every field, from cooking and business to film and design. Normally, annual plans cost anywhere from $120 to $240 per year, so up to a 50-percent discount represents significant savings for new or returning subscribers. Apple TV+ (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Proton VPN (24 months) for $59.76 (75 percent off): Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN — a secure, trustworthy app that doesn't sacrifice features, speed or usability. Although its free plan does come with unlimited data, we recommend upgrading to get the full set of servers and features. With this deal, you'll get servers in 117 countries; better yet, every one of those we've tested so far can unblock Netflix. Black Friday Lego deals LEGO Star Wars: A New Hope Boarding the Tantive IV Fantasy Toy 75387 for $44 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars Brick-Built Star Wars Logo 75407 for $48 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars R2-D2 Building Toy Set 75379 for $80 (20 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Mandrake Figure & Pot Plant Toy 76433 for $41 (41 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Thestral Family Building Toy 76458 for $49 (30 percent off) Black Friday gaming deals The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia for $22 (46 percent off): There is so much lore and history to the Zelda franchise that it was difficult to keep things straight. That is, up until a few years ago when this compendium came out and finally corrected the record and shed some light on some of the murkier events across one of the most storied game sagas of all time. Xbox wireless controller for $40 (38 percent off): While we may not recommend getting an Xbox console in 2025, if you have one already and want to get some extra accessories for it, you should check out Black Friday deals. This is a basic wireless controller with an ergonomic design and a battery life of up to 40 hours. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Ninja Creami ice cream maker for $180 (22 percent off): The Creami has been one of the most sought-after kitchen appliances of the past couple of years, and for good reason. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen gear because it makes it a breeze to prepare custom ice cream and many other frozen treats. It's definitely worthwhile investment if you're an ice cream lover and want to experiment with making your own flavors. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $180 (22 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Dyson V9 Motorbar cordless vacuum for $270 (55 percent off): Any time you can get a Dyson for under $300, it's a deal to consider. This V9 Motorbar is an older model, but it still has excellent suction power, 40 minutes of runtime and it comes with four attachments that let you clean everything from your floors to your couch to the inside of your car. Don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals at Dyson direct or Amazon. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. More Black Friday tech deals Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool heater and fan for $300 ($200 off): I've had this heater and fan for over five years at this point and it remains one of my favorite pieces of tech. It's lightweight enough to carry from room to room and it's both a heater and a fan: it cuts the chill in my home office during the winter, and circulates the air to keep me cooler in the summer. You can control the whole thing using the included remote (and it includes a sleep timer), and it handily attaches magnetically to the top of the device so you don't misplace it. DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off, Prime exclusive): Yes, the Neo 2 just came out, but it's still unclear if that model will make its way to the US. For now, if you want an affordable drone to capture your next adventure, the original Neo remains an excellent option. It was our top pick for the best drone for those on a budget, and it's an even better buy at this sale price. Theragun Mini (3rd gen) for $168 (24 percent off): The most compact percussion massager that Therabody makes, the latest Mini is small enough to toss in your gym bag or carry-on to take with you when you're traveling. It comes with three head attachments and it charges via USB-C. Also available at Therabody. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $200 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro. TCL QM6K (55-inch) 4K TV for $398 ($202 off): The QM6K is widely regarded as one of this year’s better TV bargains. As a budget model, it won’t get you top-notch contrast, color volume, brightness or HDR performance, but its quantum-dot color, mini-LED backlighting and full-array local dimming help it more than hold its own for the money. It’s a nice buy for gaming on a budget as well, since it has a fast 144Hz refresh rate that can reach as high at 288Hz if you play in 1080p. This deal marks a new low. The 65-inch and 75-inch models are also at their all-time lows at $498 and $698, respectively. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Samsung 65-inch Frame Pro smart TV for $1,598 (24 percent off): The latest version of Samsung's art TV, the Frame Pro lets you show artwork on the screen when you're not watching a sports game or binge-watching your favorite show. It supports 4K content, VRR gaming at up to 4K 144Hz and runs on Samsung's NQ4 AI Gen3 processor. Also available at Best Buy. Black Friday FAQs When is Black Friday 2025?

That brings the PS5 Digital Edition down to $399, the standard PS5 to $449 and the new PS5 Pro to $649. If you’ve been holding out for the right time to upgrade or buy your first console, these are the deals to beat. You'll find them direct at Sony and from other retailers including Amazon and Walmart. Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for $499: Black Friday Nintendo sales were announced recently and, unsurprisingly, there won't be many true deals out there this year. There are no straight discounts on the Switch 2 console, so your best bet is to pick up a bundle that saves you some cash on a Switch 2 game. One of the best is the Mario Kart Wold bundle, but Pokémon fans should consider the Pokémon Legends: Z-A bundle, too. Black Friday deals under $50 Govee Smart LED Light Bars for $30 ($20 off, Prime exclusive): Another of our stocking stuffer picks are these smart LED light bars from Govee. They can stand up or lie flat so they can go just about anywhere and are infinitely adjustable via the app. You can even set them to light up in sync with your music. Alexa and the Google Assistant will let you control them with just your voice (and a smart speaker). Jisulife Life 7 handheld fan for $25 (14 percent off): This handy little fan is a must-have if you life in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades show its remaining battery level. Samsung Evo Select (512GB) for $33 ($14 off): We recommend the Evo Select in our microSD card buying guide for those on a tight budget. It has mediocre write speeds, so it’s not ideal for a camera, but it should be serviceable for most people just looking to add space to an Android tablet or original Nintendo Switch on the cheap. (Note that this is a standard UHS-I card, not a newer microSD Express model.) This deal matches the lowest price to date for the 512GB variant. Also at Samsung and B&H. UGreen Uno Nexode Charger Block (65W, 3-Port) for $33 (35 percent off): There are other ways to charge your devices, but few are this cute. That’s why we named it one of the best stocking stuffers you can buy. You get three ports in its head and outlet prongs hidden in its removable magnetic feet. Its 65 watts are enough to charge multiple devices at once. Also available directly from UGreen. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 (42 percent off): One of our favorite streaming devices, the 4K Max dongle supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, 4K and HDR10+ and it has Wi-Fi 6E for a speedier, more stable internet connection. It also supports the Fire TV Ambient Experience, which can display art on your TV when you're not actively using it. Anker Nano magnetic power bank (5K, Qi2 15W) for $39 (30 percent off): This ultra-slim battery pack snaps magnetically to the backs of compatible phones to power them up, allowing you to use your device while it's charging. It comes in multiple colors and supports the latest Qi2 charging standard. Leebin 2025 electric spin scrubber for $40 (43 percent off, Prime exclusive): This weird little scrubber makes cleaning my bathroom and shower much less of a pain. Just choose the brush head you need for your job and the rotating head takes care of most of the hard work. I love the adjustable handle, which extends from 12 to 50 inches so you can get into hard-to-reach places without breaking a sweat. Monarch Money budgeting app (one year) for $50 (50 percent off with code MONARCHVIP): One of our favorite budgeting apps, Monarch Money gives you a lot of control over the organization of your funds. There's a helpful goals feature for when you're planning out big purchases or financial milestones you want to hit, and we found the month-in-review recap it provides to be more thorough than other budgeting apps we tried. There's even Zillow integration for folks looking to buy a home. Black Friday Apple deals Apple AirPods 4 for $80 (38 percent off): These are the most affordable AirPods you can get, and the latest model has been substantially improved over the previous. They have a better fit and noticeably better sound quality than their predecessor, plus some advanced features previously only found on pricer models. Apple Watch SE 3 for $200 ($50 off): The SE has been our top pick for the best Apple Watch for those on a budget, and the latest model only solidifies that further. It has the same chipset found in the latest flagship Apple Watches, fast-charging capabilities, an always-on display and most of the same activity-tracking features you'll find in more expensive model. Apple MacBook Air (13-inch, M4) for $749 ($250 off): Our top pick for the best laptop you can get, the M4 MacBook Air will be plenty of power for most people in a convenient, premium package. It's thin and light as ever, with an excellent keyboard and trackpad, plus enough battery life to get you through a whole day of work, video calls and more. Apple Mac Mini M4 for $479 ($120 off): Desktop users looking for an upgrade should consider the latest Mac Mini, which runs on the M4 chip and 16GB of RAM as standard in the base configuration. This version has a smaller design that takes up less space, front-facing USB-C ports and a headphone jack, plus Thunderbolt 5 support. Apple iPad Air M3 (11 inch) for $449 (25 percent off): We consider this to be the best iPad for most people thanks to its strong performance, big , sharp display, good battery life, improved multitasking capabilities and its compatibility with the Apple Pencil Pro. Black Friday streaming deals and subscription deals MasterClass Black Friday deal — get up to 50 percent off subscriptions: MasterClass is running a limited-time offer that cuts up to 50 percent off all annual subscriptions for Black Friday. The deal gives you access to hundreds of lessons taught by experts and well-known names across nearly every field, from cooking and business to film and design. Normally, annual plans cost anywhere from $120 to $240 per year, so up to a 50-percent discount represents significant savings for new or returning subscribers. Apple TV+ (6 months) for $36 ($42 off): Apple TV+ is offering six months of access for only $36 for Black Friday, which comes out to a discounted price of $6 per month for the six-month period. The deal is live now for new and eligible returning subscribers and runs through December 1, giving you a chance to stream shows like Silo, The Morning Show and For All Mankind for less. The biggest caveat to the deal is that you must subscribe directly through Apple and not through a third-party service. Sling TV Orange — day pass for only $1: Sling TV launched Day Passes earlier this year, giving users one-day access to a variety of its packages. This deal cuts $4 off the normal price of a day pass for Sling Orange. With that, you get unlimited access for 24 hours to Orange's more than 30 channels that includes ESPN, CNN, TBS and others. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Proton VPN (24 months) for $59.76 (75 percent off): Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN — a secure, trustworthy app that doesn't sacrifice features, speed or usability. Although its free plan does come with unlimited data, we recommend upgrading to get the full set of servers and features. With this deal, you'll get servers in 117 countries; better yet, every one of those we've tested so far can unblock Netflix. Black Friday Lego deals LEGO Star Wars: A New Hope Boarding the Tantive IV Fantasy Toy 75387 for $44 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars Brick-Built Star Wars Logo 75407 for $48 (20 percent off) LEGO Star Wars R2-D2 Building Toy Set 75379 for $80 (20 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Mandrake Figure & Pot Plant Toy 76433 for $41 (41 percent off) LEGO Harry Potter Thestral Family Building Toy 76458 for $49 (30 percent off) Black Friday gaming deals The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia for $22 (46 percent off): There is so much lore and history to the Zelda franchise that it was difficult to keep things straight. That is, up until a few years ago when this compendium came out and finally corrected the record and shed some light on some of the murkier events across one of the most storied game sagas of all time. Xbox wireless controller for $40 (38 percent off): While we may not recommend getting an Xbox console in 2025, if you have one already and want to get some extra accessories for it, you should check out Black Friday deals. This is a basic wireless controller with an ergonomic design and a battery life of up to 40 hours. SanDisk microSD Express card (256GB) for $60 (12 percent off): If you have a Switch 2, no regular microSD card will do if you want to expand the console's storage. You need a newer microSD Express card, and currently there are only a handful on the market. We did some testing to find the best microSD Express card for the Switch 2 and found that performance was, in general, very similar amongst all the readily available cards. We recommend getting whichever fits within your budget at the capacity you want. Black Friday smart home and kitchen deals Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $90 (25 percent off): I personally have this air fryer, one of our top picks, in my house and I've used it for over a year with no issues. I love that it makes good use of vertical space so it doesn't take up too much space on my counter, and its rounded-square shape allows me to cook more food than you'd think in one go in the basket. It crisps all kinds of foods up well and generally takes a lot of the guess work (and time) out of making a good meal. Aura 10.1-inch digital frame for $139 (22 percent off): Aura makes some of our favorite digital frames, and this one has a 10-inch HD display, Wi-Fi connectivity and an elegant mat design. Arguably the best thing about Aura frames in general is that you don't have to pay a subscription fee to add photos to it over time — all photos are stored in the cloud, and multiple people can add photos to one frame. Ninja Creami ice cream maker for $180 (22 percent off): The Creami has been one of the most sought-after kitchen appliances of the past couple of years, and for good reason. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen gear because it makes it a breeze to prepare custom ice cream and many other frozen treats. It's definitely worthwhile investment if you're an ice cream lover and want to experiment with making your own flavors. Ninja Dual-Zone air fryer (10-quart) for $180 (22 percent off): If you cook for large crowds on Thanksgiving and other occasions, this is the air fryer to get. Not only is it a large, 10-quart capacity model, but it also has two separate cooking areas. You can crisp up potatoes on one side and brussel sprouts on the other with no issues. Use the Smart Finish feature to cook two separate foods in different ways and have them both be done at the same time, or Match Cook to copy the cooking method in both chambers. Dyson V9 Motorbar cordless vacuum for $270 (55 percent off): Any time you can get a Dyson for under $300, it's a deal to consider. This V9 Motorbar is an older model, but it still has excellent suction power, 40 minutes of runtime and it comes with four attachments that let you clean everything from your floors to your couch to the inside of your car. Don't forget to check out all of the other Dyson Black Friday deals at Dyson direct or Amazon. Breville Smart Oven Air Fryer Pro for $300 ($100 off): One of the most versatile air fryers out there, this Breville machine not only air fries, but also bakes, roasts, toasts, dehydrates, reheats and more. It also has a large capacity that can cook a 14-pound turkey or a tray of muffins with ease. Dyson 360 Vis Nav robot vacuum for $400 ($600 off): This is one of the best robot vacuums you can get, period. It doesn't have a self-emptying base, but its superior suction power almost makes up for that. It's one of the strongest robot vacuums I've ever tested, and it has excellent obstacle avoidance. The latter means you will rarely, if ever, have to attend to it getting caught on the edge of a carpet or getting stuck under a piece of furniture. More Black Friday tech deals Dyson AM09 Hot + Cool heater and fan for $300 ($200 off): I've had this heater and fan for over five years at this point and it remains one of my favorite pieces of tech. It's lightweight enough to carry from room to room and it's both a heater and a fan: it cuts the chill in my home office during the winter, and circulates the air to keep me cooler in the summer. You can control the whole thing using the included remote (and it includes a sleep timer), and it handily attaches magnetically to the top of the device so you don't misplace it. DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off, Prime exclusive): Yes, the Neo 2 just came out, but it's still unclear if that model will make its way to the US. For now, if you want an affordable drone to capture your next adventure, the original Neo remains an excellent option. It was our top pick for the best drone for those on a budget, and it's an even better buy at this sale price. Theragun Mini (3rd gen) for $168 (24 percent off): The most compact percussion massager that Therabody makes, the latest Mini is small enough to toss in your gym bag or carry-on to take with you when you're traveling. It comes with three head attachments and it charges via USB-C. Also available at Therabody. Bose QuietComfort headphones for $200 (43 percent off): These noise-cancelling headphones have a comfortable (albeit a bit boring) design, an \"Aware\" mode that lets you hear more of your surroundings when you need to and up to 24 hours of battery life. Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $248 ($158 off): While the new XM6 headphones have replaced these as Sony's flagship cans, that doesn't mean the XM5 aren't worth buying. They were our top pick for the best wireless headphones for years before the XM6 came around, and they still have excellent ANC, great sound quality, long battery life, a comfortable fit and handy extra features like multipoint connectivity. GoPro Hero 13 Black Extended Power Bundle for $349 ($150 off): This bundle gives you our favorite action cam plus three Enduro batteries, a dual battery charger, one adhesive mount, a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, two USB-C cables and more. It makes a great all-in-one gift for the budding videographer or aspiring influencer in your life, or a solid addition to your own camera kit. Also available at GoPro. TCL QM6K (55-inch) 4K TV for $398 ($202 off): The QM6K is widely regarded as one of this year’s better TV bargains. As a budget model, it won’t get you top-notch contrast, color volume, brightness or HDR performance, but its quantum-dot color, mini-LED backlighting and full-array local dimming help it more than hold its own for the money. It’s a nice buy for gaming on a budget as well, since it has a fast 144Hz refresh rate that can reach as high at 288Hz if you play in 1080p. This deal marks a new low. The 65-inch and 75-inch models are also at their all-time lows at $498 and $698, respectively. Also at Best Buy and Walmart. Samsung 65-inch Frame Pro smart TV for $1,598 (24 percent off): The latest version of Samsung's art TV, the Frame Pro lets you show artwork on the screen when you're not watching a sports game or binge-watching your favorite show. It supports 4K content, VRR gaming at up to 4K 144Hz and runs on Samsung's NQ4 AI Gen3 processor. Also available at Best Buy. Black Friday FAQs When is Black Friday 2025?

The Nintendo Switch 2 is the console launch of 2025 and it will undoubtedly be at the top of many wish lists for both kids and adults alike. If you were hoping to save a bit on the console during the Black Friday shopping season, you may be disappointed. The Nintendo Black Friday sale was just announced, and unsurprisingly, there aren't a lot of true \"deals\" to be had. This is typical of Nintendo — legit Nintendo Black Friday deals are hard to come by — but there are ways to at least get the best value for your money if you're going to pick up a Switch 2 before the year is out. As has been the case for many years, the marquee Nintendo deals for the holidays come in the form of console bundles. When the Switch 2 launched earlier this year, it was available as just the console only for $449 or bundled with Mario Kart World for $499. Both options are still available now, but there's a new bundle to consider as well — the console with the new Pokémon Legends: Z-A game, which also costs $499. Considering the games by themselves cost $70 each, you do save a bit by picking up a console bundle. you can pick up the console and its bundles at most retailers including Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy and others. Nintendo Switch game deals When it comes to deals on Nintendo Switch 2 games, the Nintendo eShop will have Cyber Deals starting on November 20, running through December 3. The shop will feature \"holiday offers on select games,\" so it appears we'll all just have to go to the online store on November 20 to see the games on offer. Starting on November 23, select retailers will have discounts on some physical Switch games including Princess Peach: Showtime!, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe. Those will each be $40, while other games like Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo Switch Sports, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Splatoon 3 will be $30. Nintendo Switch accessory deals Switch 2 accessories were conspicuously absent from the announced deals, but there's always a chance they'll receive discounts from third-party retailers like Amazon, Walmart and Best Buy. A handful of official Nintendo accessories made it onto our best Switch 2 accessories list, but you can find plenty of good ones from other manufacturers as well. If you're keen on getting a first-party accessory, though, for yourself or as a gift for someone else, here's where you can find some of the most popular ones.

          "title": "Anker Black Friday deals: Save on power banks, wireless chargers, power adapters and other accessories",
          "standfirst": "Loads of Anker gear is on sale for Black Friday, and we rounded up the best deals we could find right here. We decided we like Anker so much, it deserves its own roundup. Afterall, the brand makes some of our favorite accessories for keeping phones, tablets and computers charged up and otherwise connected with excellent wireless chargers, MagSafe power banks, iPad accessories and more. Part of why we love this stuff is the affordability — particularly for what you get — but now these Anker Black Friday deals make these buys an even better value. Don’t hesitate to stock up. Black Friday deals: Anker power banks Power banks revive dead phones, let you work longer while away from an outlet and allow you to play with your tablet/ereader/gamepad while it charges without being tethered to a wall. After testing out brands from a slew of different makers, our picks just keep coming back to Anker. The mix of value, capacity and clever features make Anker batteries just a little bit better than a lot of the brands out there. Anker makes the Laptop Power bank, which our reviewer (me) called the culmination of all the best battery features. The brand is also responsible for our top MagSafe battery pick (the MagGo Qi2) thanks to its clever stand, excellent charging speeds and generous capacity. We also think Anker's Ultra-Slim MagSafe bank is a better deal than Apple's Air MagSafe battery. Many of the other banks we’ve tested and tried are also on sale for Black Friday, so consider this your opportunity to make sure your phone never goes dead on you again. Black Friday deals: Anker wireless chargers A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the loveliest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy solution. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our wireless charger guide and our list of the best multi-device chargers. Now, thanks to Black Friday, you can keep your devices topped off with quality accessories that are an even better value than usual. Black Friday deals: Anker power adapters While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our guide to the best fast chargers and we recommend the brand in a number of our accessories guides. Now that Black Friday is here, a number of Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here. Black Friday deals: Anker Soundcore audio We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. They also make our overall favorite pair of budget earbuds, the Space A40. With Black Friday deals in full effect, these are the best Anker Soundcore deals we could find. More Anker Black Friday deals My personal favorite USB-C cable is made by Anker. It’s rated at 240 watts, has a durable build, plus it’s six-feet long and has a handy right angled connector at one end. Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that show up in our guides to the best accessories again and again. Here are the best Black Friday deals on Anker gear that doesn’t quite fit into the categories above.

We also think Anker's Ultra-Slim MagSafe bank is a better deal than Apple's Air MagSafe battery. Many of the other banks we’ve tested and tried are also on sale for Black Friday, so consider this your opportunity to make sure your phone never goes dead on you again. Black Friday deals: Anker wireless chargers A rats nest of cables on your desk is not the loveliest look. Now that phones, earbuds, smartwatches and even ereaders can refill on a charging coil, wireless chargers are a tidy solution. There are options that’ll let you view your phone while it charges, as well as some that will charge three devices at once. We’ve tested units from dozens of brands for our buying guides and keep putting Anker on our lists of winners. The brand makes some of the top picks in both our wireless charger guide and our list of the best multi-device chargers. Now, thanks to Black Friday, you can keep your devices topped off with quality accessories that are an even better value than usual. Black Friday deals: Anker power adapters While wireless charging is faster than it’s ever been, cords are still the fastest way to charge your phone. Bigger devices like your laptop will reup faster on a high-wattage brick than on a dinky 20-watt adapter and if you want to keep your outlets more streamlined, go for a multi-port power adapter that will let you charge multiple devices at once. Again, after testing many brands, some of our most reliable picks continue to be from Anker. It shows up three times in our guide to the best fast chargers and we recommend the brand in a number of our accessories guides. Now that Black Friday is here, a number of Anker power adapters are on sale — so we rounded them all up here. Black Friday deals: Anker Soundcore audio We mostly think of Anker as a charging accessory brand. But they’ve expanded their scope by getting into audio equipment — and the effort was a success. You might not immediately pick up that these are Anker speakers — Soundcore shows up on the products themselves, but it’s the same company. We recommend a couple Soundcore music makers in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. They also make our overall favorite pair of budget earbuds, the Space A40. With Black Friday deals in full effect, these are the best Anker Soundcore deals we could find. More Anker Black Friday deals My personal favorite USB-C cable is made by Anker. It’s rated at 240 watts, has a durable build, plus it’s six-feet long and has a handy right angled connector at one end. Anker of course also makes plenty of other gear, from webcams to mice — that show up in our guides to the best accessories again and again. Here are the best Black Friday deals on Anker gear that doesn’t quite fit into the categories above.

This model is also available in storage sizes of 128GB and 512GB. This particular model easily made our list of the best microSD cards for the Nintendo Switch 2. It even made our list of the best Switch 2 accessories. It just gets the job done. We loved the speed on offer here. It was the fastest of all the cards we tested when transferring games and loading games. We also found that it performed admirably at just about every test we threw at it. The card was always consistently right near the top, thanks to outstanding sequential read and write performance. This was backed up by benchmark testing with PC tools like CrystalDiskMark. The Switch 2 only works with SD Express cards, so this covers that. Luckily, this card isn't just for Nintendo's latest console. It'll work with just about everything, if you ever find it outstays its usefulness as a storage container for Mario and friends. Elsewhere when it comes to microSD Express cards on sale: PNY's 256GB card is down to $50, as is Lexar's Play Pro 256GB card.

          "standfirst": "Whether you need a new pair of headphones for yourself or as a gift this holiday season, Black Friday deals should save you some cash. Cans from a bunch of brands are on sale now, including Beats. One of the best deals from that brand is on the Beats Studio Pro, which is available for a whopping 51 percent off. Grab a pair while they're down to $170; this matches the cost we've seen for the Studio Pro headphones during other peak shopping times earlier this year. The Beats brand last updated this wireless over-ear headset in 2023, but it's still a solid choice for a workhorse pair of headphones. The current model improved audio quality and added a useful Transparency mode, so that you can listen to your tunes and still be aware of the world around you, which is great for settings such as public transit and the gym. The other option is a more immersive active noise-canceling mode. Beats Studio Pro also support lossless audio when wired on a USB-C cable. The official specs say the battery life for the headphones lasts up to 40 hours, or 24 hours when the active noise canceling mode is engaged. If you need to eke more life out of these Beats, they do offer a fast-charging mode that promises four hours of activity from just ten minutes of recharge. There are several color options for the Beats Studio Pro, so if there's a particular hue you want to be sporting, this might be a deal to hop on quickly before the supplies run out or the deal expires. Also on sale in the Beats realm for Black Friday is the Beats Solo 4, which is 35 percent off and down to $130.

For Black Friday, you can save on Apple's Bluetooth trackers — a four-pack is on sale for $65 right now at Amazon and Walmart, which is just about the lowest price we've seen. Bear in mind that this deal brings the price per AirTag down to $16 if you were to buy them individually, and when not on sale they usually cost $29. If you use Apple devices and are prone to losing stuff, AirTags are the obvious choice of Bluetooth tracker to buy. Adding one to your account requires little more than a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network offering such extensive coverage these days, it’s never been easier to find missing belongings. Tracking down a still nearby misplaced item is as easy as using your iPhone to trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively you can use Precision Finding to pinpoint its location through Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone’s screen, paying attention to its vibrations as you get closer. If you only need a single AirTag, they’re also on sale right now for $18, another record low. It works out a bit better as a deal if you purchase the four-pack, but if you just want to attach one to your keys or backpack, $65 might seem like a stretch. Just remember that AirTags can’t be attached to items right out of the box. You’ll need to add an accessory in order to turn one into a keyring, or even attach it to your pet’s collar.

The still-excellent WH-1000XM5 wireless headphones are down to $250, which is the lowest price we've seen them. Yes, the latest model, the XM6, have technically replaced these in Sony's lineup. But if the latest flagships are out of your price range, these former Engadget favorites are well worth considering at this heavily reduced price. We awarded the WH-1000XM5 a score of 95 in our 2022 review, praising the supremely comfortable redesign, sound quality and powerful ANC. Battery life is also very respectable at 30 hours. We found the punchy bass an improvement over their predecessors, and the overall sound deeper and more immersive than the M4 headphones. As for noise-canceling, Sony’s decision to double the number of microphones and processors used for ANC means an improvement in blocking higher frequency sounds, such as human voices. They aren’t entirely baby scream-proof, but then few headphones are. Naturally, the WH-1000XM6 that this year replaced the M5 as Sony’s flagship model offers even better sound quality and noise cancellation, while remaining extremely comfortable throughout long listening sessions. But they’re also a lot more expensive at $450 — they're on sale now for $398 for Black Friday, so you have the option to upgrade to the latest flagship if you're willing to spend a bit more. However, we still think the XM5 deal is the best value for most people here.

That includes the new Apple Watch SE 3, which you can snag for only $200 right now at Amazon and Walmart. We consider this to be the best budget Apple Watch, and arguably the best smartwatch for folks who have never owned one before. The latest version runs on the same chipset found in the new flagship models, and it has most of the same fitness and workout tracking features you'll find in those more expensive devices as well. The SE 3 also now has an always-on display, making it easier to glance down throughout the day to check the time or see activity stats without moving your wrist, and fast-charging support makes it a more viable sleep tracker. Just plop it down on its charger for a bit at the end of the day and put it back on to monitor your sleep overnight. Also discounted is the flagship Apple Watch Series 11, which is $50 off and down to $349. We consider it to be the best smartwatch, period, thanks to its longer battery life, thin and light design, comprehensive health and fitness tracking features and extra perks like gesture control.

Just plop it down on its charger for a bit at the end of the day and put it back on to monitor your sleep overnight. Also discounted is the flagship Apple Watch Series 11, which is $50 off and down to $349. We consider it to be the best smartwatch, period, thanks to its longer battery life, thin and light design, comprehensive health and fitness tracking features and extra perks like gesture control.

This kitchen gadget, which scored 90 in our review, is guaranteed to make you popular with guests during the holiday season, and at $50 off its regular price of $250 — the lowest price we’ve seen this year for this particular model — now is a great time to buy. While you’ll definitely need a bit of space to accommodate it, the Creami is a more compact ice cream machine than some of its rivals. It works similarly to a food processor, only here you’ll be using strictly frozen liquid ice cream as a base. Once you have that (you’ll need to give the base around 24 hours in the freezer for the desired consistency) you use Ninja’s machine to blend in your chosen flavors. And if you make a mess (and let’s face it, you probably will), rest assured that most of the components are dishwasher-safe. It’s admittedly a fairly loud machine during use, but as long as you’re willing to put up with the noise, you can choose between seven one-touch programs, including milkshake if you’re in the mood for a cold drink. And if you’re hosting people with allergies, they can be reassured that you have total control about what’s going into and coming out of the machine, which is much harder to guarantee when you’re buying dessert in a restaurant. This model also includes two pint containers with lids. If you want the latest and greatest, though, the Ninja Swirl is the ice-cream maker to get. It can make regular and soft-serve ice cream, plus a number of other frozen treats. Right now, QVC has it for the best price we've seen, from $350 to $280.

          "title": "Black Friday VPN deals: Get up to 75 percent off Proton VPN two-year plans",
          "standfirst": "A VPN subscription can make for a good holiday gift. Everyone could do with having a VPN to help protect their online activity from prying eyes (and, perhaps, access more things to watch from their favorite streaming services). It's something useful that a gift recipient may have never realized they needed. Of course, you may be looking for a great deal on a VPN yourself, and the Black Friday discount for Proton VPN is nothing to sniff at. You can get two years of access to the VPN Plus tier of the service for $59.76, which works out to $2.49 per month. That's a discount of 75 percent compared with the regular price of $10 per month. Overall, you'd save $180. Proton VPN is our pick for the best VPN overall because it checks all of the boxes it needs to. There is a free plan with unlimited data, but with that you can only connect to servers in a few countries and the connection might not be fast enough for you to watch anything from your preferred streaming service's library in that locale. The VPN Plus tier unlocks a lot more options, such as the ability to connect to 15,000 servers across more than 120 countries and simultaneous protection for up to 15 devices. The apps are well-designed — Proton has clients for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android — and it's easy to find a feature or setting you're looking for. In our testing, Proton VPN Plus had a relatively small impact on browsing speeds. Our download speeds dropped by 12 percent and uploads by 4 percent, while the global average ping remained below 300 ms (which is especially impressive if you're connecting to a server on the other side of the planet). Perhaps, most importantly, though, it's Proton's commitment to privacy that helps make its VPN an easy recommendation. There's a no-logs policy, meaning it does not log user activity or any identifiable characteristics of devices that connect to the VPN. Proton's servers use full-disk encryption to bolster privacy as well. Proton VPN is not the only service to offer a Black Friday VPN deal this year, of course. There are plenty of others available on services we like. Here are the best of the bunch if you're looking for an alternative to Proton VPN. Surfshark One (24 months + 3 free months) for $59.13 (88 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. NordVPN Plus (24 months + 3 free months) for $105.03 (74 percent off): NordVPN has taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription for Black Friday. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. CyberGhost (24 months + 4 free months) for $56.94 (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Private Internet Access (36 months + 4 free months) for $79.20 (83 percent off): Private Internet Access (PIA) is giving out the best available price right now on a VPN I'd recommend using. With this deal, you can get 40 months of PIA for just under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected.

The Delta Pro 3 topped Yahoo's list of the best portable power stations, and for very good reason. This thing is a beast.

It can be stretched out to two or three days by only running the appliance during daylight hours. There's even a discounted bundle that includes an extra battery for $3,279. It includes four standard 120V AC outlets and a single 240V outlet. It could potentially be a temporary hub of a whole-home battery backup. There are numerous charging options here, including a standard AC outlet, solar panels and, interestingly, a cigarette lighter. The only potential downside here is the Delta Pro 3 really pushes the boundaries of what can be considered portable. It weighs 113 pounds, though it does have wheels and a telescoping handle.

The Karu 2 didn't make our list of the best pizza ovens, but most of the list is populated by Ooni products. The company makes good stuff.

It's intended for outdoor use and it's on the lighter side, at 33 pounds. This should make it easy when moving it around the backyard or when taking it to a friend's house for an impromptu pizza party. To that end, the company sells a luggage-like cover for the oven. The interior reaches temperatures up to 950F. This can cook a pizza in around a minute. The only downside here? This is an oven that's only for outdoor use and, well, winter is coming. Ooni has discounted plenty of its other models for Black Friday, but not the indoor Volt 2 pizza oven. These deals last until December 2.

For Black Friday, you can get 50 percent off our favorite budgeting app, Quicken Simplifi. The Quicken Simplifi app is down to $3 monthly from $6 monthly, adding up to $36 for the year.

The sale starts today and is available until Wednesday, December 3. One of the many things that sets Quicken Simplifi apart from its competitors is its sleek, easy to use interface. The setup is pretty straightforward and it allows for your spouse or financial advisor to act as co-manager of the account. It also clearly shows figures like net worth, recent spending, upcoming recurring payments and more. Plus, there's an option to say if you're expecting a refund. Quicken Simplifi unfortunately doesn't offer a free trial so testing it out with a discount means less money invested if it's not for you.

          "standfirst": "Large language models (LLMs) have astounded the world with their capabilities, yet they remain plagued by unpredictability and hallucinations – confidently outputting incorrect information. In high-stakes domains like finance, medicine or autonomous systems, such unreliability is unacceptable. Enter Lean4, an open-source programming language and interactive theorem prover becoming a key tool to inject rigor and certainty into AI systems. By leveraging formal verification, Lean4 promises to make AI safer, more secure and deterministic in its functionality. Let&#x27;s explore how Lean4 is being adopted by AI leaders and why it could become foundational for building trustworthy AI.What is Lean4 and why it mattersLean4 is both a programming language and a proof assistant designed for formal verification. Every theorem or program written in Lean4 must pass a strict type-checking by Lean’s trusted kernel, yielding a binary verdict: A statement either checks out as correct or it doesn’t. This all-or-nothing verification means there’s no room for ambiguity – a property or result is proven true or it fails. Such rigorous checking “dramatically increases the reliability” of anything formalized in Lean4. In other words, Lean4 provides a framework where correctness is mathematically guaranteed, not just hoped for.This level of certainty is precisely what today’s AI systems lack. Modern AI outputs are generated by complex neural networks with probabilistic behavior. Ask the same question twice and you might get different answers. By contrast, a Lean4 proof or program will behave deterministically – given the same input, it produces the same verified result every time. This determinism and transparency (every inference step can be audited) make Lean4 an appealing antidote to AI’s unpredictability.Key advantages of Lean4’s formal verification:Precision and reliability: Formal proofs avoid ambiguity through strict logic, ensuring each reasoning step is valid and results are correct.Systematic verification: Lean4 can formally verify that a solution meets all specified conditions or axioms, acting as an objective referee for correctness.Transparency and reproducibility: Anyone can independently check a Lean4 proof, and the outcome will be the same – a stark contrast to the opaque reasoning of neural networks.In essence, Lean4 brings the gold standard of mathematical rigor to computing and AI. It enables us to turn an AI’s claim (“I found a solution”) into a formally checkable proof that is indeed correct. This capability is proving to be a game-changer in several aspects of AI development.Lean4 as a safety net for LLMsOne of the most exciting intersections of Lean4 and AI is in improving LLM accuracy and safety. Research groups and startups are now combining LLMs’ natural language prowess with Lean4’s formal checks to create AI systems that reason correctly by construction.Consider the problem of AI hallucinations, when an AI confidently asserts false information. Instead of adding more opaque patches (like heuristic penalties or reinforcement tweaks), why not prevent hallucinations by having the AI prove its statements? That’s exactly what some recent efforts do. For example, a 2025 research framework called Safe uses Lean4 to verify each step of an LLM’s reasoning. The idea is simple but powerful: Each step in the AI’s chain-of-thought (CoT) translates the claim into Lean4’s formal language and the AI (or a proof assistant) provides a proof. If the proof fails, the system knows the reasoning was flawed – a clear indicator of a hallucination. This step-by-step formal audit trail dramatically improves reliability, catching mistakes as they happen and providing checkable evidence for every conclusion. The approach that has shown “significant performance improvement while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence” of correctness.Another prominent example is Harmonic AI, a startup co-founded by Vlad Tenev (of Robinhood fame) that tackles hallucinations in AI. Harmonic’s system, Aristotle, solves math problems by generating Lean4 proofs for its answers and formally verifying them before responding to the user. “[Aristotle] formally verifies the output… we actually do guarantee that there’s no hallucinations,” Harmonic’s CEO explains. In practical terms, Aristotle writes a solution in Lean4’s language and runs the Lean4 checker. Only if the proof checks out as correct does it present the answer. This yields a “hallucination-free” math chatbot – a bold claim, but one backed by Lean4’s deterministic proof checking.Crucially, this method isn’t limited to toy problems. Harmonic reports that Aristotle achieved a gold-medal level performance on the 2025 International Math Olympiad problems, the key difference that its solutions were formally verified, unlike other AI models that merely gave answers in English. In other words, where tech giants Google and OpenAI also reached human-champion level on math questions, Aristotle did so with a proof in hand. The takeaway for AI safety is compelling: When an answer comes with a Lean4 proof, you don’t have to trust the AI – you can check it.This approach could be extended to many domains. We could imagine an LLM assistant for finance that provides an answer only if it can generate a formal proof that it adheres to accounting rules or legal constraints. Or, an AI scientific adviser that outputs a hypothesis alongside a Lean4 proof of consistency with known physics laws. The pattern is the same – Lean4 acts as a rigorous safety net, filtering out incorrect or unverified results. As one AI researcher from Safe put it, “the gold standard for supporting a claim is to provide a proof,” and now AI can attempt exactly that.Building secure and reliable systems with Lean4Lean4’s value isn’t confined to pure reasoning tasks; it’s also poised to revolutionize software security and reliability in the age of AI. Bugs and vulnerabilities in software are essentially small logic errors that slip through human testing. What if AI-assisted programming could eliminate those by using Lean4 to verify code correctness?In formal methods circles, it’s well known that provably correct code can “eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities [and] mitigate critical system failures.” Lean4 enables writing programs with proofs of properties like “this code never crashes or exposes data.” However, historically, writing such verified code has been labor-intensive and required specialized expertise. Now, with LLMs, there’s an opportunity to automate and scale this process. Researchers have begun creating benchmarks like VeriBench to push LLMs to generate Lean4-verified programs from ordinary code. Early results show today’s models are not yet up to the task for arbitrary software – in one evaluation, a state-of-the-art model could fully verify only ~12% of given programming challenges in Lean4. Yet, an experimental AI “agent” approach (iteratively self-correcting with Lean feedback) raised that success rate to nearly 60%. This is a promising leap, hinting that future AI coding assistants might routinely produce machine-checkable, bug-free code.The strategic significance for enterprises is huge. Imagine being able to ask an AI to write a piece of software and receiving not just the code, but a proof that it is secure and correct by design. Such proofs could guarantee no buffer overflows, no race conditions and compliance with security policies. In sectors like banking, healthcare or critical infrastructure, this could drastically reduce risks. It’s telling that formal verification is already standard in high-stakes fields (that is, verifying the firmware of medical devices or avionics systems). Harmonic’s CEO explicitly notes that similar verification technology is used in “medical devices and aviation” for safety – Lean4 is bringing that level of rigor into the AI toolkit.Beyond software bugs, Lean4 can encode and verify domain-specific safety rules. For instance, consider AI systems that design engineering projects. A LessWrong forum discussion on AI safety gives the example of bridge design: An AI could propose a bridge structure, and formal systems like Lean can certify that the design obeys all the mechanical engineering safety criteria. The bridge’s compliance with load tolerances, material strength and design codes becomes a theorem in Lean, which, once proved, serves as an unimpeachable safety certificate. The broader vision is that any AI decision impacting the physical world – from circuit layouts to aerospace trajectories – could be accompanied by a Lean4 proof that it meets specified safety constraints. In effect, Lean4 adds a layer of trust on top of AI outputs: If the AI can’t prove it’s safe or correct, it doesn’t get deployed.From big tech to startups: A growing movementWhat started in academia as a niche tool for mathematicians is rapidly becoming a mainstream pursuit in AI. Over the last few years, major AI labs and startups alike have embraced Lean4 to push the frontier of reliable AI:OpenAI and Meta (2022): Both organizations independently trained AI models to solve high-school olympiad math problems by generating formal proofs in Lean. This was a landmark moment, demonstrating that large models can interface with formal theorem provers and achieve non-trivial results. Meta even made their Lean-enabled model publicly available for researchers. These projects showed that Lean4 can work hand-in-hand with LLMs to tackle problems that demand step-by-step logical rigor.Google DeepMind (2024): DeepMind’s AlphaProof system proved mathematical statements in Lean4 at roughly the level of an International Math Olympiad silver medalist. It was the first AI to reach “medal-worthy” performance on formal math competition problems – essentially confirming that AI can achieve top-tier reasoning skills when aligned with a proof assistant. AlphaProof’s success underscored that Lean4 isn’t just a debugging tool; it’s enabling new heights of automated reasoning.Startup ecosystem: The aforementioned Harmonic AI is a leading example, raising significant funding ($100M in 2025) to build “hallucination-free” AI by using Lean4 as its backbone. Another effort, DeepSeek, has been releasing open-source Lean4 prover models aimed at democratizing this technology. We’re also seeing academic startups and tools – for example, Lean-based verifiers being integrated into coding assistants, and new benchmarks like FormalStep and VeriBench guiding the research community.Community and education: A vibrant community has grown around Lean (the Lean Prover forum, mathlib library), and even famous mathematicians like Terence Tao have started using Lean4 with AI assistance to formalize cutting-edge math results. This melding of human expertise, community knowledge and AI hints at the collaborative future of formal methods in practice.All these developments point to a convergence: AI and formal verification are no longer separate worlds. The techniques and learnings are cross-pollinating. Each success – whether it’s solving a math theorem or catching a software bug – builds confidence that Lean4 can handle more complex, real-world problems in AI safety and reliability.Challenges and the road aheadIt’s important to temper excitement with a dose of reality. Lean4’s integration into AI workflows is still in its early days, and there are hurdles to overcome:Scalability: Formalizing real-world knowledge or large codebases in Lean4 can be labor-intensive. Lean requires precise specification of problems, which isn’t always straightforward for messy, real-world scenarios. Efforts like auto-formalization (where AI converts informal specs into Lean code) are underway, but more progress is needed to make this seamless for everyday use.Model limitations: Current LLMs, even cutting-edge ones, struggle to produce correct Lean4 proofs or programs without guidance. The failure rate on benchmarks like VeriBench shows that generating fully verified solutions is a difficult challenge. Advancing AI’s capabilities to understand and generate formal logic is an active area of research – and success isn’t guaranteed to be quick. However, every improvement in AI reasoning (like better chain-of-thought or specialized training on formal tasks) is likely to boost performance here.User expertise: Utilizing Lean4 verification requires a new mindset for developers and decision-makers. Organizations may need to invest in training or new hires who understand formal methods. The cultural shift to insist on proofs might take time, much like the adoption of automated testing or static analysis did in the past. Early adopters will need to showcase wins to convince the broader industry of the ROI.Despite these challenges, the trajectory is set. As one commentator observed, we are in a race between AI’s expanding capabilities and our ability to harness those capabilities safely. Formal verification tools like Lean4 are among the most promising means to tilt the balance toward safety. They provide a principled way to ensure AI systems do exactly what we intend, no more and no less, with proofs to show it.Toward provably safe AIIn an era when AI systems are increasingly making decisions that affect lives and critical infrastructure, trust is the scarcest resource. Lean4 offers a path to earn that trust not through promises, but through proof. By bringing formal mathematical certainty into AI development, we can build systems that are verifiably correct, secure, and aligned with our objectives.From enabling LLMs to solve problems with guaranteed accuracy, to generating software free of exploitable bugs, Lean4’s role in AI is expanding from a research curiosity to a strategic necessity. Tech giants and startups alike are investing in this approach, pointing to a future where saying “the AI seems to be correct” is not enough – we will demand “the AI can show it’s correct.”For enterprise decision-makers, the message is clear: It’s time to watch this space closely. Incorporating formal verification via Lean4 could become a competitive advantage in delivering AI products that customers and regulators trust. We are witnessing the early steps of AI’s evolution from an intuitive apprentice to a formally validated expert. Lean4 is not a magic bullet for all AI safety concerns, but it is a powerful ingredient in the recipe for safe, deterministic AI that actually does what it’s supposed to do – nothing more, nothing less, nothing incorrect.As AI continues to advance, those who combine its power with the rigor of formal proof will lead the way in deploying systems that are not only intelligent, but provably reliable.Dhyey Mavani is accelerating generative AI at LinkedIn.

          "content": "Large language models (LLMs) have astounded the world with their capabilities, yet they remain plagued by unpredictability and hallucinations – confidently outputting incorrect information. In high-stakes domains like finance, medicine or autonomous systems, such unreliability is unacceptable. Enter Lean4, an open-source programming language and interactive theorem prover becoming a key tool to inject rigor and certainty into AI systems. By leveraging formal verification, Lean4 promises to make AI safer, more secure and deterministic in its functionality. Let&#x27;s explore how Lean4 is being adopted by AI leaders and why it could become foundational for building trustworthy AI.What is Lean4 and why it mattersLean4 is both a programming language and a proof assistant designed for formal verification. Every theorem or program written in Lean4 must pass a strict type-checking by Lean’s trusted kernel, yielding a binary verdict: A statement either checks out as correct or it doesn’t. This all-or-nothing verification means there’s no room for ambiguity – a property or result is proven true or it fails. Such rigorous checking “dramatically increases the reliability” of anything formalized in Lean4.

          "content": "Hacker conferences—like all conventions—are notorious for giving attendees a parting gift of mystery illness. To combat “con crud,” New Zealand’s premier hacker conference, Kawaiicon, quietly launched a real-time, room-by-room carbon dioxide monitoring system for attendees. To get the system up and running, event organizers installed DIY CO2 monitors throughout the Michael Fowler Centre venue before conference doors opened on November 6. Attendees were able to check a public online dashboard for clean air readings for session rooms, kids’ areas, the front desk, and more, all before even showing up. “It’s ALMOST like we are all nerds in a risk-based industry,” the organizers wrote on the convention’s website. “What they did is fantastic,” Jeff Moss, founder of the Defcon and Black Hat security conferences, told WIRED. “CO2 is being used as an approximation for so many things, but there are no easy, inexpensive network monitoring solutions available. Kawaiicon building something to do this is the true spirit of hacking.”Read full article Comments",
