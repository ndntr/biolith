If you don’t want to wait until Black Friday to score a discount, the current promo is a great opportunity to save, as Amazon is offering steep discounts on a variety of last-gen Apple devices. The Apple Watch Series 10, for example, is down to $279, matching the low price we saw in July. It’s not just older devices on sale, either. Amazon is offering discounts on accessories for the new iPhone Air, as well as current-gen gadgets like the latest iPad Mini. To make sorting through the deluge of deals a little easier, we’ve rounded up all the best Apple discounts available, along with links to competing retailers who happen to be matching Amazon’s pricing. You may not need to sign up for a Prime membership just to save a few bucks, either, which is always a plus in our book.

While not a laptop, there’s no denying how good the M4 Mac Mini is — especially on sale for $499 ($100 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. It was $30 cheaper in the summer, but if you already have a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to use, there’s no better value for a powerful little desktop. Read our review.

          "standfirst": "If you need some new tech, but want to spend less than $25, this list is for you. Thanks to Amazon’s October Prime Day, we’re seeing plenty of useful tech that’s surprisingly affordable. Of course, plenty of things on sale for Prime Day are not good buys — but here we’ve found the tech that’s both on sale and worthy of your attention. These speakers, accessories, mice, chargers and more are all from brands we’ve actually reviewed and recommend. We’re seeing deals from Anker, Amazon Echo, Roku, TP-Link and more, on gear found in our many buying guides and reviews. So dive in with your $25 and come away with some decent tech thanks to the best Prime Day tech deals under $25. Prime Day tech deals under $25 Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): If you lose stuff, stop it with a Bluetooth tracker like this. The Pop is our current top pick in our guide. It works with either Apple’s Find My app or Google’s Find Hub app, calling on iPhone or Android phone users respectively to anonymously ping your lost stuff so you can find it. Blink Mini 2 security camera for $20 ($20 off): This is the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener. Kasa TP-Link Smart Wi-FI outdoor plug for $15 ($7 off with Prime): We tested a similar plug for our buying guide to smart plugs and named it the best outdoor pick for HomeKit users — but this model only works with Alexa and the Google Assistant. The range was decent and setup was easy, like most TP-Link plugs. Grab this now and have automatic control of your holiday lights. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $23 ($12 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for a Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. Belkin Apple AirTag holder for $15 ($5 off with Prime): The best thing about Apple’s AirTags are their ability to rope in most any nearby iPhone to anonymously hunt for lost trackers. The worst thing is probably the tiny, slippery disk shape that can’t attach to anything without some help. This is the solution we suggest in our iPhone accessories guide. Anker Nano Charger, USB-C 30W charger for $13 ($4 off with Prime): Here’s a tiny but mighty wall adapter that we like for iPhones (but it would work for an iPad too). It can pass on 30 watts of power to your device and looks nice doing it in five different pearlescent shades. Anker Nano portable charger for $20 ($10 off with Prime): It looks like an oldey timey lipstick case and can deliver a partial refill to any small device with a USB-C port. We named it a good pick after testing it for our battery guide. Roku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $24 ($16 off): This is our top pick for the best streaming device for accessing free and live content. The dongle supports 4K video and HDR and doesn’t need to be plugged into the wall for power. It’s a great way to access any streaming service you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more. Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (10FT,100W) for $9 ($3 off with Prime): Having a bad cable is almost as bad as not having a cable at all. We’re big fans of Anker’s cords. This one is a generous 10 feet and can deliver up to 100W of power. While it can transfer data, it does so slowly, so don’t grab this one for that purpose. This is $1 more than it sold for as a Prime-exclusive in July. Anker Right-Angle USB-C braided charging cable (two-pack) for $9 ($7 off with Prime): This is the cable I used to turn an old iPad into a digital picture frame. The right-angle looks much neater than a straight cable, plus this one can shuttle up to 240 watts of power during charging. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (128GB) for $13 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. The larger-capacity 256GB model is on sale for $23, but the 128GB is a better gigs-to-dollars deal. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Pebblebee Clip Universal for $25 ($10 off with Prime): This is our runner up pick for a rechargeable Bluetooth tracker. It’s ear-splittingly loud, has bright flashing LEDs and works with either Google or Apple’s finding networks. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS that we liked in our guide with this device. The best thing about Roku devices is the access to all the free content — and this is an affordable way to get it. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off): Here’s what we named the best budget streaming stick. At a price this low and only an HD resolution, you shouldn’t expect a premium picture, but if you just want a quick way to get your streaming apps up and running on a basic screen, this will do the thing. Ring Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events. Echo Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year. JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17 ($13 off with Prime): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): We named this thumbdrive one of the best SSDs you can buy. This configuration has 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Thermacell E55 Rechargeable Repeller for $19 ($16 off): The mosquitos aren’t going anywhere. Even places that didn’t used to have these evil bloodsuckers are now overrun. If you would like some reprieve from the bites, this is the repeller we recommend in our guide to outdoor tech.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/amazon-prime-day-tech-deals-under-25-save-on-blink-anker-roku-and-fire-tv-084136589.html?src=rss",
          "content": "If you need some new tech, but want to spend less than $25, this list is for you. Thanks to Amazon’s October Prime Day, we’re seeing plenty of useful tech that’s surprisingly affordable. Of course, plenty of things on sale for Prime Day are not good buys — but here we’ve found the tech that’s both on sale and worthy of your attention. These speakers, accessories, mice, chargers and more are all from brands we’ve actually reviewed and recommend. We’re seeing deals from Anker, Amazon Echo, Roku, TP-Link and more, on gear found in our many buying guides and reviews. So dive in with your $25 and come away with some decent tech thanks to the best Prime Day tech deals under $25. Prime Day tech deals under $25 Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): If you lose stuff, stop it with a Bluetooth tracker like this. The Pop is our current top pick in our guide. It works with either Apple’s Find My app or Google’s Find Hub app, calling on iPhone or Android phone users respectively to anonymously ping your lost stuff so you can find it. Blink Mini 2 security camera for $20 ($20 off): This is the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside. Audible (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener. Kasa TP-Link Smart Wi-FI outdoor plug for $15 ($7 off with Prime): We tested a similar plug for our buying guide to smart plugs and named it the best outdoor pick for HomeKit users — but this model only works with Alexa and the Google Assistant. The range was decent and setup was easy, like most TP-Link plugs. Grab this now and have automatic control of your holiday lights. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $23 ($12 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for a Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. Belkin Apple AirTag holder for $15 ($5 off with Prime): The best thing about Apple’s AirTags are their ability to rope in most any nearby iPhone to anonymously hunt for lost trackers. The worst thing is probably the tiny, slippery disk shape that can’t attach to anything without some help. This is the solution we suggest in our iPhone accessories guide. Anker Nano Charger, USB-C 30W charger for $13 ($4 off with Prime): Here’s a tiny but mighty wall adapter that we like for iPhones (but it would work for an iPad too). It can pass on 30 watts of power to your device and looks nice doing it in five different pearlescent shades. Anker Nano portable charger for $20 ($10 off with Prime): It looks like an oldey timey lipstick case and can deliver a partial refill to any small device with a USB-C port. We named it a good pick after testing it for our battery guide. Roku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $24 ($16 off): This is our top pick for the best streaming device for accessing free and live content. The dongle supports 4K video and HDR and doesn’t need to be plugged into the wall for power. It’s a great way to access any streaming service you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more. Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (10FT,100W) for $9 ($3 off with Prime): Having a bad cable is almost as bad as not having a cable at all. We’re big fans of Anker’s cords. This one is a generous 10 feet and can deliver up to 100W of power. While it can transfer data, it does so slowly, so don’t grab this one for that purpose. This is $1 more than it sold for as a Prime-exclusive in July. Anker Right-Angle USB-C braided charging cable (two-pack) for $9 ($7 off with Prime): This is the cable I used to turn an old iPad into a digital picture frame. The right-angle looks much neater than a straight cable, plus this one can shuttle up to 240 watts of power during charging. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (128GB) for $13 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. The larger-capacity 256GB model is on sale for $23, but the 128GB is a better gigs-to-dollars deal. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Pebblebee Clip Universal for $25 ($10 off with Prime): This is our runner up pick for a rechargeable Bluetooth tracker. It’s ear-splittingly loud, has bright flashing LEDs and works with either Google or Apple’s finding networks. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS that we liked in our guide with this device. The best thing about Roku devices is the access to all the free content — and this is an affordable way to get it. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off): Here’s what we named the best budget streaming stick. At a price this low and only an HD resolution, you shouldn’t expect a premium picture, but if you just want a quick way to get your streaming apps up and running on a basic screen, this will do the thing. Ring Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events. Echo Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year.

The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours.

          "standfirst": "You may not be looking to spend big on tech this October Prime Day, but it's still a good idea to look for tech essentials during the shopping event while you can get some at good discounts. Anker makes some of our favorite charging gear and I always end up picking up an accessory or two during Prime Day to ensure I have what I need when I need it most, and I feel better knowing I didn't spend full price on it. For example, in sales past, I picked up a couple of extra USB-C charging cables so I could keep one in my carry-on luggage so I always have one when I travel. My partner will likely be upgrading to an iPhone 17 this year, so we'll have to get a few more USB-C cables now that Lightning is officially banished from our home. Also, every year it seems I need yet another surge protector, so even though I picked one up the year before — but one can never have too many. Here, we've collected all of the best October Prime Day deals on Anker devices and other charging gear we could find, and we'll update this post as the event goes on with the latest offerings. Anker Prime Day deals: Power banks Power banks are not as straightforward as you might think. They come in all shapes, sizes and capacities and can have extra features like magnetic alignment, built-in kickstands, extra ports and more. It's worth considering how you'll use a power bank before you decide on the right one to buy. Smartphones don’t need huge-capacity bricks to power up a couple of times over; a 5K or 10K portable charger should be plenty if that’s all you’re looking to support. If you want a more versatile accessory that can charge a tablet, laptop or gaming handheld, consider a brick with a higher capacity — and more ports so you can charge multiple devices simultaneously. Anker Prime Day deals: Wireless chargers A good wireless charger can lighten your cable load. While wired charging remains faster and more efficient, wireless chargers can clean up your space by eliminating a few of those cables that constantly trip you up. We recommend thinking about where you'll use a wireless charger before buying one. Those outfitting a home office with new tech may want a wireless charging stand that puts their phone in an upright position that’s easier to see while it’s powering up, while those who want a wireless charger for their nightstand might prefer a lay-flat design or a power station that can charge a smartphone, smartwatch and pair of earbuds all at once. Anker Prime Day deals: Charging gear Plenty of other charging gear is on sale for Prime Day. It’s never a bad idea to pick up a few 30W USB-C adapters so you always have what you need to reliably power up your phone. Same goes for extra USB-C (or USB-A) cables that can live in your car, in your office at work or by the couch.

          "standfirst": "Regardless of if you need a new laptop for work or play, October Prime Day may have just what you’re looking for at a good price. Amongst the clothing, shoes, household essentials and other tech gear are some decent laptop deals that you can snag if you’re a Prime member — and even some that you can grab without a Prime subscription. But deciphering what constitutes a “good deal” on a laptop during Prime Day can be a bit challenging. That’s due in part to the manic nature of laptop prices on Amazon in particular: they fluctuate often depending on model, brand, configuration, seller and more. But Engadget can help by collecting all of the best October Prime Day laptop deals here so you don’t have to go searching for them. Best Prime Day laptop deals: MacBooks Apple’s latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, and we recommend getting those if you want a device that’s as future-proof as possible at the moment. You’ll find decent MacBook deals on Amazon throughout the year, and most of them will be on the base configurations. In a welcomed update earlier this year, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as you’ll find on the base-level Pros). Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $979 (18 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4) for $1,399 (13 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M4) for $2,249 (10 percent off) Best Prime day laptop deals: Windows laptops You’ve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 16GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If you’re looking for a new gaming laptop, you’ll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot. HP Ultrabook 14 (14-inch, Intel N100) for $280 (20 percent off) Lenovo IdeaPad 1i (Windows 11, 15-inch, Intel Celeron) for $280 (30 percent off) Acer Nitro V gaming laptop (15-inch, Intel Core i5) for $600 (20 percent off) Dell 15 3530 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15-inch, Intel Core i5) for $659 (27 percent off) Alienware 16 Aurora gaming laptop (16-inch, Intel Core 7) for $1,050 (25 percent off) Best Prime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks Most Chromebooks are already pretty cheap, but that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day. However, there are a ton of premium Chromebooks available today that didn’t exist even three years ago, so now is a great time to look out for discounts on those models. In general, we recommend looking for at least 4 to 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of SDD storage in a Chromebook that you plan on using as your daily driver.

          "standfirst": "If the Engadget reviews team agrees on one thing, it's that audio matters. The best soundbars put the \"theater\" in \"home theater.\" The best smart speakers let you turn a space into your favorite soundscape without using your hands. And the best portable bluetooth speakers don't just transform any space into a party — they can actually enhance your listening experience instead of merely substituting for non-portable speakers. October Prime Day is your best chance to experience what's truly different about really good audio. For two days, you'll be able to get the products below at prices you likely won't see again (even when the next Prime Day rolls around). Best Prime Day bluetooth speaker deals JBL Xtreme 2 for $297 ($53 off): This deal isn't just the best way to get ahold of the JBL Xtreme 2, an old favorite from 2018 we still love — it actually ships two Xtreme 2 units. If you place both strategically, you'll get a deep surround sound experience. Each Xtreme 2 can get louder than you'd expect from a portable speaker, putting out 40 watts at maximum, and stays charged for around 15 hours. JBL Xtreme 3 for $209 (37 percent off): The JBL Xtreme 3 is a hefty bluetooth speaker with a 15-hour battery life and the ability to chain together with other JBL speakers. But don't fret if you've only got one — even on its own, we've found the Xtreme 3's 100-watt output manages to sound both crisp and deep in any space. At 4.3 pounds, it's tough enough to travel but not too heavy to carry. JBL Flip 6 for $100 ($30 off): The JBL Flip 6 is a solid choice for an all-around bluetooth speaker, performing well in any room or on the go. It sounds good at almost any frequency and volume, runs for 12 hours on a single charge and is nearly impossible to damage with falls, dust or water. JBL Go 3 for $45 (10 percent off): The JBL Go 3 is a decent and highly affordable carabiner speaker for all your outdoor adventures — as is its sister product, the Go 3 Eco, which is made from recycled materials. It's obviously not the most powerful speaker at 4.2 watts, but it has a surprisingly good functional range. Plus, the design looks good on any belt or backpack. Ultimate Ears Miniroll for $47 (41 percent off): Miniroll is the smallest speaker from Ultimate Ears, but it punches far above its weight, starting with UE's trademark massive volume buttons. While small enough to fit in a jeans pocket, its combination of a driver and radiator manages about 85 decibels. A Miniroll can run for about 12 hours on a single charge. Ultimate Ears Boom 4 for $95 (37 percent off): The UE Boom 4 is a balanced speaker that does well anywhere. Take it camping (it's waterproof and a charge lasts for 15 hours), to a party (it puts out loud 360 degree sound) or make it part of a permanent home system by chaining it with other UE speakers — one of these plus two Minirolls or Wonderbooms would come pretty close to full surround sound. Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 for $66 (34 percent off): The Wonderboom 4 may be our favorite UE product. At just 1.2 pounds, it can pump out mighty sound on its own, or chain with other UE speakers for a deeper full-range experience. USB charging is simple and lasts for 14 hours between top-ups. Ultimate Ears Everboom for $231 ($40 off): The Everboom is the middle ground of the UE line, with more powerful output than the Wonderboom and more portability than the Hyperboom. Its 360 degree sound pairs with an Outdoor Boost feature to work better outside, though it isn't quite as impressive in the middle ranges. Bose SoundLink Flex for $99 (34 percent off): We've rarely seen the Bose SoundLink Flex this cheap, so now is the time to snap up this high-fidelity outdoor speaker. It's small enough to carry in one hand and can be operated from up to 30 feet away via the Bose Connect app. We've also found it simple and fun to use for hands-free phone calls during breaks in the music. Bose SoundLink Revolve+ for $179 (40 percent off): The SoundLink Revolve+ line, Bose's original upright 360-degree speakers, continue to pack a punch. This current model features a 17-hour battery life, IP55 water resistance and the ability to connect to a smart speaker to extend your virtual assistant's range. Bose SoundLink Max for $299 ($100 off): The Bose SoundLink Max may put you in mind of a classic boombox, with its detachable handle and thudding base. But inside it's all modern, with a 50-watt output, an effective range of 52.6Hz and a 20-hour rechargeable battery. It even comes with a 3.5mm AUX input to connect to a turntable, if you really want to embrace your inner 90s DJ. Anker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): This larger speaker doesn't look like much, but it's tough, water-resistant and versatile. It's got a broad range of optimal pitch, effective across 70 Hz from bass to treble, and 12 watts of output. While it's portable and sounds good outdoors, its wide design means it can also substitute for a soundbar in your home theater. Soundcore Select 4 Go for $18 (20 percent off): The Soundcore Select 4 Go weighs only 9.3 ounces, which makes the rest of its specs even more impressive: 20 hours of battery life, IP67 waterproofing and sound that fills rooms. It even sounds pretty good in compact outdoor spaces, more than capable of serenading an outdoor desk or livening up a pool party. Soundcore Motion 300 for $56 (30 percent off): The Soundcore Motion 300 is a full-frequency champ, with clean sound in the higher ranges and reasonably heavy bass. Its adaptive audio feature changes output depending on whether the speaker is currently lying down, standing on end or hanging from your belt loop. It's also small and light enough to carry in your pocket or clip to your backpack. Marshall Emberton II for $100 (44 percent off): Marshall, the old warhorse of the audio world, continues to crush it with the portable and bluetooth-ready Emberton II. Although it looks like an antique, it's anything but, with 360-degree sound and over 30 hours of battery life from a single charge — all weighing a little more than a quarter of a pound. Best Prime Day smart speaker deals Amazon Echo Pop for $25 (38 percent off): The Echo Pop is Amazon's smallest and cheapest smart speaker, resembling an Echo Dot sliced in half. It's a little quiet, and probably best for extending Alexa's range rather than serving as the primary host for your virtual assistant. In a smaller room, though, this is as convenient and clear-sounding as any other Echo you'll use. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 (44 percent off): Other than perhaps the Pop, no Amazon Echo fits better on a bedside table than the Spot. Its user-friendly design incorporates both a speaker and a digital display — so it's recognizable as a classic alarm clock, but with much more information on the screen and far better sound quality. This is the lowest price we've ever seen it sell for. Sonos Era 100 for $180 ($20 off): The Sonos Era 100 is a fantastic smart speaker for an even better price. It's not only loud — it also sounds good at any volume, no matter what platform you're streaming audio from. It can connect via bluetooth or physical lines, and uses TruePlay to tune the sound to your current location using included mics. Sonos Era 300 for $379 ($100 off): In our full review of the Sonos Era 300, we found that it's easy to set up and sounds incredible. It includes the exciting spatial audio feature that makes music sound like it's coming from everywhere — while it doesn't always work, it's exhilarating when it hits. The Era 300 can even automatically tune sound to your location, and you no longer need an iPhone for this feature to work. Best Prime Day soundbar deals JBL Bar 300 for $250 (38 percent off): The Bar 300, part of JBL's 2023 soundbar explosion, is a mighty yet cheap soundbar with an integrated subwoofer. Despite being small, it manages to create a theatrical experience by working both Dolby Atmos and MultiBeam. Its voice sharpening algorithm is especially good at making dialogue clearer (for those of us who always have to put on the subtitles). Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus for $150 (40 percent off): One of the cheapest soundbars you'll ever see, the Fire TV Soundbar Plus provides a noticeable boost to your TV's audio quality, even if it doesn't reach Dolby Atmos heights. It's simple, but that makes it a breeze to set up — all you have to do is plug in one HDMI cable. Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 for $498 ($202 off): The Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6 is part of Sony's Dolby Atmos soundbar lineup. It stands out from that line as a great entry point, balancing theatrical sound with defined dialogue by adjusting outputs through machine learning. It's capable of transforming normal stereo into surround sound through automatic up-mixing. Roku Streambar for $69 (31 percent off): The Roku Streambar is already affordable, but this deal puts it within anyone's reach. It's also economical in terms of space — as we noted in our full review, it's about the size of an egg carton, but still manages to give off near-surround sound.

          "content": "If the Engadget reviews team agrees on one thing, it's that audio matters. The best soundbars put the \"theater\" in \"home theater.\" The best smart speakers let you turn a space into your favorite soundscape without using your hands. And the best portable bluetooth speakers don't just transform any space into a party — they can actually enhance your listening experience instead of merely substituting for non-portable speakers. October Prime Day is your best chance to experience what's truly different about really good audio. For two days, you'll be able to get the products below at prices you likely won't see again (even when the next Prime Day rolls around). Best Prime Day bluetooth speaker deals JBL Xtreme 2 for $297 ($53 off): This deal isn't just the best way to get ahold of the JBL Xtreme 2, an old favorite from 2018 we still love — it actually ships two Xtreme 2 units. If you place both strategically, you'll get a deep surround sound experience. Each Xtreme 2 can get louder than you'd expect from a portable speaker, putting out 40 watts at maximum, and stays charged for around 15 hours. JBL Xtreme 3 for $209 (37 percent off): The JBL Xtreme 3 is a hefty bluetooth speaker with a 15-hour battery life and the ability to chain together with other JBL speakers. But don't fret if you've only got one — even on its own, we've found the Xtreme 3's 100-watt output manages to sound both crisp and deep in any space. At 4.3 pounds, it's tough enough to travel but not too heavy to carry. JBL Flip 6 for $100 ($30 off): The JBL Flip 6 is a solid choice for an all-around bluetooth speaker, performing well in any room or on the go. It sounds good at almost any frequency and volume, runs for 12 hours on a single charge and is nearly impossible to damage with falls, dust or water. JBL Go 3 for $45 (10 percent off): The JBL Go 3 is a decent and highly affordable carabiner speaker for all your outdoor adventures — as is its sister product, the Go 3 Eco, which is made from recycled materials. It's obviously not the most powerful speaker at 4.2 watts, but it has a surprisingly good functional range. Plus, the design looks good on any belt or backpack. Ultimate Ears Miniroll for $47 (41 percent off): Miniroll is the smallest speaker from Ultimate Ears, but it punches far above its weight, starting with UE's trademark massive volume buttons. While small enough to fit in a jeans pocket, its combination of a driver and radiator manages about 85 decibels. A Miniroll can run for about 12 hours on a single charge. Ultimate Ears Boom 4 for $95 (37 percent off): The UE Boom 4 is a balanced speaker that does well anywhere. Take it camping (it's waterproof and a charge lasts for 15 hours), to a party (it puts out loud 360 degree sound) or make it part of a permanent home system by chaining it with other UE speakers — one of these plus two Minirolls or Wonderbooms would come pretty close to full surround sound. Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 for $66 (34 percent off): The Wonderboom 4 may be our favorite UE product. At just 1.2 pounds, it can pump out mighty sound on its own, or chain with other UE speakers for a deeper full-range experience. USB charging is simple and lasts for 14 hours between top-ups. Ultimate Ears Everboom for $231 ($40 off): The Everboom is the middle ground of the UE line, with more powerful output than the Wonderboom and more portability than the Hyperboom. Its 360 degree sound pairs with an Outdoor Boost feature to work better outside, though it isn't quite as impressive in the middle ranges. Bose SoundLink Flex for $99 (34 percent off): We've rarely seen the Bose SoundLink Flex this cheap, so now is the time to snap up this high-fidelity outdoor speaker. It's small enough to carry in one hand and can be operated from up to 30 feet away via the Bose Connect app. We've also found it simple and fun to use for hands-free phone calls during breaks in the music. Bose SoundLink Revolve+ for $179 (40 percent off): The SoundLink Revolve+ line, Bose's original upright 360-degree speakers, continue to pack a punch. This current model features a 17-hour battery life, IP55 water resistance and the ability to connect to a smart speaker to extend your virtual assistant's range. Bose SoundLink Max for $299 ($100 off): The Bose SoundLink Max may put you in mind of a classic boombox, with its detachable handle and thudding base. But inside it's all modern, with a 50-watt output, an effective range of 52.6Hz and a 20-hour rechargeable battery. It even comes with a 3.5mm AUX input to connect to a turntable, if you really want to embrace your inner 90s DJ. Anker Soundcore 2 for $28 (38 percent off): This larger speaker doesn't look like much, but it's tough, water-resistant and versatile. It's got a broad range of optimal pitch, effective across 70 Hz from bass to treble, and 12 watts of output. While it's portable and sounds good outdoors, its wide design means it can also substitute for a soundbar in your home theater. Soundcore Select 4 Go for $18 (20 percent off): The Soundcore Select 4 Go weighs only 9.3 ounces, which makes the rest of its specs even more impressive: 20 hours of battery life, IP67 waterproofing and sound that fills rooms. It even sounds pretty good in compact outdoor spaces, more than capable of serenading an outdoor desk or livening up a pool party. Soundcore Motion 300 for $56 (30 percent off): The Soundcore Motion 300 is a full-frequency champ, with clean sound in the higher ranges and reasonably heavy bass. Its adaptive audio feature changes output depending on whether the speaker is currently lying down, standing on end or hanging from your belt loop. It's also small and light enough to carry in your pocket or clip to your backpack. Marshall Emberton II for $100 (44 percent off): Marshall, the old warhorse of the audio world, continues to crush it with the portable and bluetooth-ready Emberton II. Although it looks like an antique, it's anything but, with 360-degree sound and over 30 hours of battery life from a single charge — all weighing a little more than a quarter of a pound. Best Prime Day smart speaker deals Amazon Echo Pop for $25 (38 percent off): The Echo Pop is Amazon's smallest and cheapest smart speaker, resembling an Echo Dot sliced in half. It's a little quiet, and probably best for extending Alexa's range rather than serving as the primary host for your virtual assistant.

          "standfirst": "Robot vacuums are more than just a gimmick. Sure, we all enjoy anthropomorphizing a Roomba from time to time, but they're not gadgets for the sake of gadgetry — keeping your living space clean is an incredibly rewarding task to automate. The only problem is that robot vacuums, and frankly all decent vacuums, are expensive. Fortunately, the steep discounts offered on Amazon this October Prime Day make the purchase a lot more justifiable, whether you want a robot buddy or a traditional vacuum cleaner. In this article, we're sharing a constantly updated list of vacuum discounts worth taking advantage of. Best Prime Day robot vacuum deals Shark AV2501AE AI Robot Vacuum for $600 ($50 off): If you like the look of the AV2501S but have even more space to clean, the AV2501AE is also on sale. Its self-empty base can go a full 60 days before you have to dump it out, so it's ideal for large spaces, complex homes or areas that see heavy use. It's got the same features otherwise, including LiDAR mapping and two hours of autonomous work. Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch for $450 (36 percent off): This robotic mop/vacuum combo is engineering so you'll almost never need to revisit it after you set it up. It can clean its own mop, refill its own water tank and empty its own dustbin for up to 30 days at a time. It's also equipped with air jets that blast dirt out of corners the vacuum can't fit into. Dreame X40 Ultra Robotic Vacuum for $665 (45 percent off): Yes, it's on the expensive side, but the Dreame X40's performance earns every penny. It's another two-in-one combo, mixing a powerful vacuum cleaner with a precise mop to diligently scrub stains. Its inner workings are engineered to keep the wet and dry messes from touching, which can cause gross leaks in lesser vacuums. Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): The Shark Matrix Plus takes the robot vacuum concept even further by working a mop into the design for hands-off wet cleaning. This model is self-cleaning, self-emptying, self-charging and capable of tackling ground-in stains on hard floors. iRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 ($100 off, Prime exclusive): This entry-level Roomba is a good pick for anyone who's new to owning a robot vacuum. It features a multi-surface brush and an edge-sweeping brush to clean all types of flooring, and it uses LiDAR navigation to avoid obstacles as it goes. The iRobot mobile app lets you control the robot, set cleaning schedules and more. iRobot Roomba Plus 504 for $380 ($210 off): For those looking to upgrade to a more advanced robot vacuum, the Roomba Plus 504 is a great next step. It can clean almost anything that might land on a home floor, and if it can't clean it, it can steer around it. Two brushes and strong suction get at tougher stains, and it even includes an app you can use to set cleaning zones and change suction force remotely. Roborock Q10 S5+ Robot Vacuum and Mop for $300 ($100 off): The Roborock Q10 S5+ is another great option for a vacuum-mop combo. It's skilled at knowing what type of floor it's on and deploying or retracting the mop appropriately, and comes with precision LiDAR mapping. You can change its settings remotely from a paired app. Roborock Qrevo Edge S5A Robot Vacuum and Mop for $650 ($350 off): The higher-end Roborock choice has two brushes positioned to keep hair from tangling in either roll. The Qrevo Edge features strong suction, hot-water mopping and 60 days of completely hands-off cleaning. It can even mop and vacuum in the same cleaning session by lifting the mop whenever it notices a carpet. Ecovacs Deebot X9 Pro Omni Robot Vacuum and Mop for $900 ($500): Evocacs is a high-end robot vacuum provider to be sure, but this deal makes the X9 Pro accessible. It cleans its mop in real time so dirty water never touches your floor and comes with a lift system that lets it mop and vacuum simultaneously. The X9 also has 16,600Pa of suction in case you've got some really ground-on stains. Best Prime Day vacuum deals Levoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $220 (37 percent off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge. Shark NV352 Navigator Lift-Away for $130 ($70 off): If you want the excellent steering and modular design of the Navigator Lift-Away but don't need as much storage in the chamber as the Deluxe offers, the basic NV352 is cheaper and just as thorough. This slightly smaller unit still comes with a HEPA filter, swivel steering and a detachable handheld vacuum, plus toggleable carpet and hardwood settings. Shark CarpetXpert HairPro for $280 ($90 off): Not all vacuums need to reinvent the wheel. The Shark CarpetXpert HairPro is the perfect midrange option, with a large brushroll for getting pet hair and other allergens out of your carpets. It's designed internally to suction and store hair without clogging, making it an even better fit for homes with pets. Shark Cordless Vacuum Cleaner for $200 (43 percent off): If you're looking for a lighter vacuum that's more maneuverable, the Shark Cordless Vacuum Cleaner might fit the bill. It's easy to steer with a self-cleaning brushroll and surprisingly strong suction. Being slimmer makes it good for fitting under furniture and around tight corners. Dyson Ball Animal Total Clean Upright Vacuum for $400 (39 percent off): Dyson is still the king of reinventing vacuums, and the bagless, hyper-maneuverable Ball Animal is a blast to use. The Ball design is based on ease of steering, but the hidden MVP is the sealing — from the head to the canister, not a hair is getting out of this one once it's in. Dyson V11 Origin Cordless Vacuum for $400 ($230 off): Dyson's take on the now-classic cordless vacuum design is another winner, with three power settings, a built-in HEPA filter and about an hour of continuous operation per charge. You can also detach the shaft and use it as a handheld vacuum as needed. Dyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 (33 percent off): Our top pick for the best cordless vacuum on the market right now, the V15 Detect has some of the strongest suction power you'll find in a stick vacuum, plus a lightweight design and a dustbin that can hold more dirt and debris than it might seem. This model comes with five cleaning attachments, including the Fluffy Optic cleaner head that has LEDs to illuminate the floor as you're vacuuming so you can better see where all the dust bunnies are.

          "standfirst": "If you've never considered adding a solid-state drive (SSD) to your PC or game console, October Prime Day is a great time to start — and if you already know what a difference extra storage can make, October Prime Day is the perfect time to outfit your build. For those who haven't heard of SSDs, they're physical upgrades that stack on top of a device's storage to make more files accessible at once. The more data a console or PC can hold at a time, the quicker it can retrieve and process that data, which makes everything run faster. Here are the best SSD deals we've managed to find on Amazon. Best Prime Day SSD deals Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA 2.5-inch Internal SSD for $69 ($25 off): The BX500 is Crucial's budget-conscious SSD option, but that doesn't mean it disappoints. This internal solid state drive cuts down on battery consumption and improves processing with read speeds reaching 540MB/s. It comes with a three-year warranty, too. Crucial P310 2TB for $112 ($38 off): The 2TB level of the Crucial P310 is a compact drive that works great in small laptops or Steam Decks — especially the latter, given Valve's warning against cramming in large SSDs. For this small size and great price, you get read speeds of over 7,000MB/s, plus a built-in heatsink and more efficient use of the device battery. Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB for $60 (43 percent off): This is an incredible deal on an internal SSD from a reliable brand. All capacities of the Samsung 990 Evo Plus are currently on sale, but even the 1TB option can visibly boost your performance with top read speeds of 7,250MB/s. There's no heatsink, but nickel plating on the controller reduces both heat output and energy use. Samsung 990 PRO 2 TB for $140 (33 percent off): Samsung's 990 Pro series represents a massive leap forward for the brand, cutting energy costs by around half while boosting speeds up to at least 7,000MB/s write and 5,000MB/s read. This version comes with 2TB of storage and its own built-in heatsink. Samsung SSD 9100 PRO 4TB for $370 (35 percent off): The 9100 Pro series comes with speeds and capacities that dwarf even the 990 Pro. If you need to improve your speeds while training large AI models or simply playing massive games, this is about the most power commercially available right now. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): The Samsung Fit Plus isn't just the best thumb drive on the market right now — it's one of the best SSDs, period. This deal gets you 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s for almost unfathomably cheap. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Kingston Fury Renegade G5 for $170 (48 percent off): For those who need the most power available — especially on machines working with AI — Kingston Fury Renegade is an affordable way to access fifth-gen PCle power. With working speeds over 14,000MB/s and backward compatibility, you'll be well-prepared for the next generation of processing. WD_BLACK 2TB SN7100 for $130 ($30 off): The SN7100 is a strong entry point to WD_BLACK's extremely powerful Gen 4 SSDs. It's built for gaming, with read speeds of up to 7,250MB/s and write speeds of 6,900. The 2TB edition has the best markdown, but 1TB is more affordable overall if you're on a tight budget — and both can easily run a whole operating system in parallel. Best Prime Day portable SSD deals SanDisk 2TB Extreme Portable SSD for $150 ($60 off): The SanDisk Extreme line of portable SSDs provides a great middle ground in both price and performance. Read speeds of 1,050MB/s are enough for transferring most files you'll encounter day-to-day. Its external design holds up too, with a large carabiner loop, IP65 waterproofing and dustproofing and drop protection as high as three meters. Kingston SX1000 1TB High Performance for $75 (35 percent off): If you can't swing a Crucial X9 or X10 right now, Kingston offers a much more affordable alternative. The SX1000 can handle both PC backups and gaming storage with ease, nearly matching the X9 in our speed tests. It's also easy to carry around, though keep a tight grip as it's not officially rated for any drop height. Seagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB for $200 (44 percent off): This Seagate SSD is specifically for expanding storage on the Xbox Series X and S, and it's designed to meet Xbox specs exactly. You'll get exactly the same performance booting a game from this card as you would from internal Xbox storage, which makes data management infinitely easier. Best Prime Day microSD card deals Samsung PRO Plus microSD Memory Card for $75 (35 percent off): The Samsung PRO Plus was a strong runner-up in our testing of the best microSD cards, with speeds only beaten out by an even higher-end card from Samsung. This excellent deal should be plenty of speed and space for most normal tasks, though, from photography to gaming. SanDisk 1TB MicroSD Card for $100 (33 percent off): For those of you who haven't managed to snag a Switch 2 yet, SanDisk is offering a near-best price on the best storage card for the original Switch. With 1TB, you'd need to download a mind-boggling number of games to get anywhere near filling it. Plus, 90MB/s write speeds mean games download fast.

          "content": "If you've never considered adding a solid-state drive (SSD) to your PC or game console, October Prime Day is a great time to start — and if you already know what a difference extra storage can make, October Prime Day is the perfect time to outfit your build. For those who haven't heard of SSDs, they're physical upgrades that stack on top of a device's storage to make more files accessible at once. The more data a console or PC can hold at a time, the quicker it can retrieve and process that data, which makes everything run faster. Here are the best SSD deals we've managed to find on Amazon. Best Prime Day SSD deals Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA 2.5-inch Internal SSD for $69 ($25 off): The BX500 is Crucial's budget-conscious SSD option, but that doesn't mean it disappoints. This internal solid state drive cuts down on battery consumption and improves processing with read speeds reaching 540MB/s. It comes with a three-year warranty, too. Crucial P310 2TB for $112 ($38 off): The 2TB level of the Crucial P310 is a compact drive that works great in small laptops or Steam Decks — especially the latter, given Valve's warning against cramming in large SSDs. For this small size and great price, you get read speeds of over 7,000MB/s, plus a built-in heatsink and more efficient use of the device battery. Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB for $60 (43 percent off): This is an incredible deal on an internal SSD from a reliable brand. All capacities of the Samsung 990 Evo Plus are currently on sale, but even the 1TB option can visibly boost your performance with top read speeds of 7,250MB/s. There's no heatsink, but nickel plating on the controller reduces both heat output and energy use. Samsung 990 PRO 2 TB for $140 (33 percent off): Samsung's 990 Pro series represents a massive leap forward for the brand, cutting energy costs by around half while boosting speeds up to at least 7,000MB/s write and 5,000MB/s read. This version comes with 2TB of storage and its own built-in heatsink. Samsung SSD 9100 PRO 4TB for $370 (35 percent off): The 9100 Pro series comes with speeds and capacities that dwarf even the 990 Pro. If you need to improve your speeds while training large AI models or simply playing massive games, this is about the most power commercially available right now. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): The Samsung Fit Plus isn't just the best thumb drive on the market right now — it's one of the best SSDs, period. This deal gets you 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s for almost unfathomably cheap. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Kingston Fury Renegade G5 for $170 (48 percent off): For those who need the most power available — especially on machines working with AI — Kingston Fury Renegade is an affordable way to access fifth-gen PCle power. With working speeds over 14,000MB/s and backward compatibility, you'll be well-prepared for the next generation of processing. WD_BLACK 2TB SN7100 for $130 ($30 off): The SN7100 is a strong entry point to WD_BLACK's extremely powerful Gen 4 SSDs. It's built for gaming, with read speeds of up to 7,250MB/s and write speeds of 6,900. The 2TB edition has the best markdown, but 1TB is more affordable overall if you're on a tight budget — and both can easily run a whole operating system in parallel. Best Prime Day portable SSD deals SanDisk 2TB Extreme Portable SSD for $150 ($60 off): The SanDisk Extreme line of portable SSDs provides a great middle ground in both price and performance. Read speeds of 1,050MB/s are enough for transferring most files you'll encounter day-to-day. Its external design holds up too, with a large carabiner loop, IP65 waterproofing and dustproofing and drop protection as high as three meters. Kingston SX1000 1TB High Performance for $75 (35 percent off): If you can't swing a Crucial X9 or X10 right now, Kingston offers a much more affordable alternative.

          "standfirst": "Whether you call it October Prime Day or use Amazon’s official title, Prime Big Deal days, the sale represents some of the lowest prices of the year in nearly every department — and that includes kitchen gear. We have a slew of food enthusiasts on staff who have tested plenty of excellent kitchen tech, as seen in our reviews and buying guides. We’ve covered everything from air fryers to sous vide machines and now, many of those gadgets are on sale. Here are the best Prime Day deals on kitchen tech we recommend, along with links to our testing so you can see why we vouch for it. The best Prime Day kitchen deals KitchenAid Artisan Series Stand Mixer for $379 ($121 off): There’s a reason this is so popular among home bakers and chefs. The Artisan KitchenAid is sort of the gold standard stand mixer, as we point out in our guide to the best kitchen tech. This isn’t an all-time low (it was $350 as recently as May), but matches the July Prime Day price. Ninja Slushi for $300 ($50 off): We haven’t officially tested this one just yet, but given our love of both the Creami and the Creami Swirl, it’s a fair bet that this one will do good things with cold stuff too. This is the lowest price of the year so far. Cosori 9-in-1 TurboBlaze Air Fryer for $90 ($30 off with Prime): This is the runner up pick in our air fryer buying guide. We appreciate the roomy basket and easy-to-use touchscreen. It’s missing the clear front window that our top pick from Instant has but, unlike that one, the Cosori has a release button on the basket which is a welcome safety feature. Vitamix 2-Speed Immersion Blender for $90 ($40 off with Prime): For quick sauces and soups, we like this nifty two-speed hand blender from Vitamix, and said so in our guide to cheap kitchen gadgets. It even comes with a whisk for making your own whipped cream. Ninja Dual Foodie Zone Air Fryer (DZ302) for $160 ($70 off): If you want to air fry two different things at the same time, this is the one to get. This is the same in specs, capacity and wattage as our top pick for a dual-zone air fryer, just with a different model number. It even has a feature that makes sure the two different foods are ready at the same time. Vitamix 5-Speed Immersion Blender for $200 ($100 off with Prime): If you want a little extra oomph from your hand blender, grab this one. We named it the best counter top replacement model in our guide to the best immersion blenders. The 625 watt motor is more powerful than most and the blender head is intelligently designed to reduce suction and prevent scratches plus it fits inside a wide mouth mason jar. Ninja Creami ice cream maker $180 ($50 off): This is one of our favorite pieces of kitchen tech and we called it a frozen fantasy-maker in our review. Note that the Creami dipped down to $160 last Black Friday but this matches the lowest price we've seen this year. Instant Pot Vortex Plus with Clear Cook for $80 ($20 off with Prime): This Vortex air fryer model is similar to our top airfryer pick, but is missing the Odor Ease feature. It still has the Clear Cook window that lets you keep an eye on your food as it crisps and the Vortex cooking tech heats up remarkably fast, with almost no pre-heating time. Meater Pro wireless thermometer for $99 ($31 off): This was previously called the Meater 2 Plus, but the company changed the name. We gave it high praise in our review, and like the extended range, strong battery life, durability and precision. Fellow Stagg EKG Pro Electric Gooseneck Kettle for $144 ($36 off with Prime): This is one of the appliances we recommend in our guide for tea gifts. I bought one based on that suggestion and have been impressed with this little kettle’s speed and good looks ever since. Instant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $65 ($65 off with Prime): Here’s a smaller version of our best overall air fryer. This one has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly thanks to a 1600-watt output. Instant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn’t take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen. KitchenAid Variable Speed Corded Hand Blender for $55 ($15 off): We recommend the cordless version of this immersion blender in our guide to those appliances. This corded version has the same variable speed trigger which makes it easy to control your recipes. Note that this sold for $5 less as recently as May. Breville InFizz Fusion beverage maker for $200 ($50 off): We called this fizz-maker the bubble master in our review. True, it’s pricier than rivals in the same space, but the upscale design — that actually looks good on a countertop — somewhat makes up for the price premium. We also appreciate the Fusion Cap that helps prevent messy eruptions when you’re bubbling up your drinks. Hamilton Beach Digital Rice Cooker for $37 ($13 off with Prime): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is great for small kitchens (but probably not for big families). We thought it outperformed other cookers that are four times the price, though it’s not the best for all-day warming of rice as the bottom bigs got a little overdone. Cosori Air Fryer Pro Compact for $85 ($15 off with Prime): One of our concerns with the Cosori 9-in-1 was that it was a little on the wide side, taking up extra countertop space. The Pro Compact has a more space-saving design while still packing a five-quart basket. Instant Pot 4QT Vortex mini air fryer for $55 ($35 off with Prime): This model’s four-quart capacity falls between our top Instant Pot air fryer pick and the budget model. It has the Clear Cook window feature, six presets and it comes in pink in addition to the standard white and black. Instant Pot Duo Plus for $70 ($70 off with Prime): We named this the best multicooker in our guide to the best kitchen tech we’ve tested. It can cook a dizzying array of foods from basic beans and rice to homemade yogurt. We like this one because it’s simple to use, and has quick-cooking modes for soup, eggs and grains. There’s even a sous vide cooking function. Breville Bambino Plus for $400 ($100 off): In our gift guide for coffee lovers, this espresso machine earned our respect for its compact size and the fact that it doesn’t cost a grand, like some machines do. Plus the controls are easy for beginners to learn but makes silky milkfoam for pro-level latte artists. Breville Juice Fountain Plus for $130 ($20 off): This went as low as $110 back in January, but it’s still a decent discount on a high-powered juice extractor. We were won over by its impressive juicing abilities and despite how it looks, it's surprisingly easy to clean — as long as you do it right away. Ninja 5.5-quart Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) for $130 ($50 off with Prime): This one earned an honorable mention in our guide to air fryers. It’s double the capacity of our budget pick and has a dehydrate preset. While we found the round basket a little cramped, we liked how the fryer’s vertical design saved counter space. Just note that this went as low as $90 in July. Vitamix Explorian E310 Blender for $330 ($50 off): This isn’t the best deal we’ve seen this year — this Vitamix dropped to $300 as recently as May. But if you’re in the market for a blender that can turn the most recalcitrant nut into the creamiest butter, we think this won’t let you down.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-kitchen-deals-include-up-to-50-percent-off-our-favorite-instant-pots-blenders-and-more-193009814.html?src=rss",

          "title": "The best October Prime Day gaming deals: Save on PS5 games, headsets, controllers and more",
          "standfirst": "Amazon’s October Prime Day sale tends to be a decent source of discounts for gaming gear, and the latest iteration of its “Prime Big Deal Days” event seems to be no exception. A number of games, headsets, mice, controllers and other accessories we like are currently on sale, so if you just can’t wait until Black Friday, we’ve rounded up the best Prime Day deals on gaming devices below. We’ll update this post as we find more; just remember that you need to be a Prime member to access some of the offers. Split Fiction (Xbox) for $25 ($25 off MSRP): A pick from our guide to the best couch co-op games, Split Fiction is a imaginative crowd-pleaser that’s designed from the ground up to be played with another person. As in, you literally need a second person to play it. Like It Takes Two before it, it overcomes some hacky writing with brisk action, a lighthearted tone and a Nintendo-like commitment to presenting new methods of play. This deal for the Xbox copy represents the lowest price we’ve tracked, though the PS5 version is also on sale for $40 if you’d rather play there. Elden Ring (PS5) for $30 ($20 off): You’ve probably heard about it by now, but the action-RPG Elden Ring is both challenging and darkly funny, with a world that runs incredibly deep and feels lived-in a way few games have. It’s unafraid to test your resolve, yet it always grants you the freedom to simply turn around and find another path forward. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5) for $35 ($15 off): Engadget’s Mat Smith gave this grandiose action-RPG a favorable review last year. You need to have played its predecessor — and ideally, the original PS1 game — to get the most out of it, but it’s positively stuffed with things to do, and its combat system is still a tactical rush at its best. Gran Turismo 7 for $30 ($40 off): Gran Turismo 7 is the PS5’s premier sim racer, and a love letter to automobiles as a whole. Like the rest of the GT series, it revels in the patience and precision required to figure out how a given car meshes with a given course. Learning the intricacies of each combination is both intense and rewarding, and there’s a singular style to it all that just doesn’t exist with most sports games. Returnal for $30 ($70 off): Returnal is a third-person shooter roguelike that’s at once a technical showcase, a stiff challenge and an achingly beautiful reflection on the nature of grief. It is not for the faint of heart, but its bullet-hell battles are wonderfully fierce, and just about everything in it contributes to its overarching story. It’s also worth checking out if you’re eager to developer Housemarque’s next game, Saros, which seems to borrow many of the elements introduced here. The Last of Us Part I for $30 ($40 off): The PS5 remake of Sony’s zombie drama is one of the most unnecessary remakes ever made, but if you’ve never played one of the earlier versions, this is the best way to rectify that. If you’re looking to play the (even moodier) sequel, the PS5 version of that one is similarly discounted. God of War Ragnarok for $30 ($40 off): Ragnarok is another Sony sequel that’s more about increasing scope than radically reinventing itself, but its Norse world is beautifully varied and detailed, smashing baddies with a magic axe feels great, and the whole thing is excessive in the way you’d expect a God of War game to be without going overboard. Horizon Forbidden West for $30 ($40 off): Engadget’s Jess Conditt called Horizon Forbidden West the “total package” in her review a few years back, praising its frenzied combat, gorgeous art direction and complex narrative. It still has one of the more distinctive post-apocalypses in gaming, blending robot beasts with stunning vistas. That helps paper over some less-than-inspired side content and bits of sluggish pacing. Final Fantasy XVI (PS5) for $23 ($7 off): Final Fantasy XVI is a more straightforward action-RPG than something like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth: You don’t need to come in with prior knowledge of any other story, and its hack-and-slash combat is simple to pick up. It can get bogged down in pointless side quests, but its main concern is having you watch giant demigods melodramatically smack each other, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon for $20 ($10 off): Armored Core VI is a big loud action game about building a mech and using it to blow up everything in sight. It rules. But it’s not mindless: Its many boss fights are genuine duels, and it’s deeply flexible in how it lets you tweak your death machine to tackle stages in different ways. This ties the best price we've seen for the PS5 version. Metaphor: ReFantazio (Xbox) for $16 ($54 off): It’s about as subtle as you’d expect a game named “Metaphor” to be, but the latest from the minds behind Persona 5 is a fantasy JRPG through and through: bombastic, stylish and deeply earnest. (And long.) This deal represents a new low, though it only applies to the Xbox copy. Madden NFL 26 for $37 ($33 off): It always feels like Madden could use a creative reset, but at the end of the day, it’s Madden, and it works fine enough if you just want to scratch the pro football game itch. This is the largest discount we’ve seen for the latest entry, and it applies to the PS5, Xbox and Switch 2 copies. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (3-month) for $57 ($33 off): It hasn’t exactly been a great stretch for Xbox lately, what with Microsoft jacking up console prices, laying off huge swaths of employees and massively hiking the cost of its Game Pass service to $30 per month. But if you aren’t looking to cancel your Game Pass subscription as a result, you can still grab three months of the top-end Ultimate tier for a little less than its old going rate. While the service itself may end up being too pricey in the long term, it’s still home to a wide range of games worth checking out, so this offer might be useful if you have some free time coming up and want to blast through a few titles you’ve been meaning to get around to. Astro A50 X gaming headset for $315 ($75 off): The A50 X is an upgrade pick in our guide to the best gaming headsets. It should specifically appeal to those who own multiple gaming systems, as its base station lets you connect and swap between PC, PS5 and Xbox audio with the press of a button. It’s among the better-sounding wireless headsets we’ve tried as well, and its mic is fantastic. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it’s the largest drop we’ve seen since February. The standard Astro A50 is also on sale for $237; that one works just as well if you only play on one device, but it lacks HDMI switching functionality. 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller for $48 ($12 off): The Ultimate 2 is a versatile wireless gamepad for Windows PCs and mobile devices. It can connect over Bluetooth, a wireless dongle or a USB cable, and its magnetic TMR joysticks should be far less susceptible to “joystick drift” than typical controllers. Those with large hands may find it a touch too small, but it’s built well, it comes with a handy charging dock and it gets a solid 20 or so hours of battery life. 8BitDo’s companion software includes a variety of useful customizations beyond that. This isn’t an all-time low, but it’s still a few bucks below the pad’s typical street price. Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite MMO gaming mouse for $55 ($25 off): We recommend the Scimitar RGB Elite to MMO and MOBA players in our guide to the best gaming mice. It’s not the lightest or most technically advanced model, but it comes with 12 comfortable and easy-to-reach side buttons, which make it easier to pull off more complex actions in games like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XIV. We’ve seen it fall below $50 a few times before, but this deal matches the lowest price we’ve tracked since May. A newer wireless model called the Scimitar Elite Wireless SE is also on sale for a low of $80. Razer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $30 ($40 off): We recommend the Basilisk V3 in our gaming mouse guide for those who don’t mind using a cable and prefer a more ergonomic right-handed shape. This is its lowest price to date. Note that Razer now sells a newer version with an improved sensor, but that one costs $49 more and isn’t a massive upgrade in real-world use. Razer DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed gaming mouse for $71 ($29 off): The wireless DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed is another recommendation from our gaming mouse buying guide. For less than $100, it gets you a sturdy yet superlight design that weighs just 55 grams — making it easy to flick around in fast-paced games — and doesn’t have any annoying cutouts in its outer shell. Its contoured shape should fit most small- to medium-sized hands comfortably, and it performs reliably for competitive play. This deal is an all-time low. ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless mechanical keyboard for $151 ($59 off): We speak positively about this model in our guide to the best gaming keyboards. Its sturdy case, crisp keycaps and battery life all impress, while the thocky NX Snow switches in this model feel and sound delightful. Its companion software is a bit of a mess, and its 96 percent layout may feel a little cramped to some, but it’s a nice buy if you want a higher-class pre-built keyboard. This is the lowest price we've seen since March. ASUS ROG Azoth mechanical keyboard for $155 ($120 off): It’s a couple years old at this point, but the ROG Azoth remains an exceptionally well-built mechanical keyboard for enthusiasts. Its gasket-mounted design and layers of foam give each key press a soft landing, while its pre-lubed switches feel nice and smooth. It even comes with a toolkit for manually lubing the switches down the road, and the PCB is hot-swappable if you ever want to switch things up. There’s a useful control knob and programmable OLED display for quickly adjusting settings and checking the battery level beyond that. ASUS' Armoury Crate software is still fairly sloppy, however. This deal comes within a couple bucks of the lowest price we've seen for a model with the linear NX Snow switches. Crucial X9 Pro (1TB) portable SSD for $75 ($26 off): If you’re looking to offload some games to external storage, we consider the Crucial X9 Pro the best portable SSD for most people, as it offers fast enough transfer speeds in a rugged and compact design. This isn’t the best price ever for the 1TB model but it matches the largest discount we’ve seen since April. Other size options are also on sale. Crucial P310 (1TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $80 ($55 off): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can use to add storage to a handheld PC like the Steam Deck or ASUS ROG Ally. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but reviews say that it performs well anyway. This deal ties the best price we’ve seen for the 1TB version since April.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-october-prime-day-gaming-deals-save-on-ps5-games-headsets-controllers-and-more-082623558.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Amazon’s October Prime Day sale tends to be a decent source of discounts for gaming gear, and the latest iteration of its “Prime Big Deal Days” event seems to be no exception. A number of games, headsets, mice, controllers and other accessories we like are currently on sale, so if you just can’t wait until Black Friday, we’ve rounded up the best Prime Day deals on gaming devices below. We’ll update this post as we find more; just remember that you need to be a Prime member to access some of the offers. Split Fiction (Xbox) for $25 ($25 off MSRP): A pick from our guide to the best couch co-op games, Split Fiction is a imaginative crowd-pleaser that’s designed from the ground up to be played with another person. As in, you literally need a second person to play it. Like It Takes Two before it, it overcomes some hacky writing with brisk action, a lighthearted tone and a Nintendo-like commitment to presenting new methods of play. This deal for the Xbox copy represents the lowest price we’ve tracked, though the PS5 version is also on sale for $40 if you’d rather play there. Elden Ring (PS5) for $30 ($20 off): You’ve probably heard about it by now, but the action-RPG Elden Ring is both challenging and darkly funny, with a world that runs incredibly deep and feels lived-in a way few games have. It’s unafraid to test your resolve, yet it always grants you the freedom to simply turn around and find another path forward. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5) for $35 ($15 off): Engadget’s Mat Smith gave this grandiose action-RPG a favorable review last year. You need to have played its predecessor — and ideally, the original PS1 game — to get the most out of it, but it’s positively stuffed with things to do, and its combat system is still a tactical rush at its best. Gran Turismo 7 for $30 ($40 off): Gran Turismo 7 is the PS5’s premier sim racer, and a love letter to automobiles as a whole. Like the rest of the GT series, it revels in the patience and precision required to figure out how a given car meshes with a given course. Learning the intricacies of each combination is both intense and rewarding, and there’s a singular style to it all that just doesn’t exist with most sports games. Returnal for $30 ($70 off): Returnal is a third-person shooter roguelike that’s at once a technical showcase, a stiff challenge and an achingly beautiful reflection on the nature of grief. It is not for the faint of heart, but its bullet-hell battles are wonderfully fierce, and just about everything in it contributes to its overarching story. It’s also worth checking out if you’re eager to developer Housemarque’s next game, Saros, which seems to borrow many of the elements introduced here. The Last of Us Part I for $30 ($40 off): The PS5 remake of Sony’s zombie drama is one of the most unnecessary remakes ever made, but if you’ve never played one of the earlier versions, this is the best way to rectify that. If you’re looking to play the (even moodier) sequel, the PS5 version of that one is similarly discounted. God of War Ragnarok for $30 ($40 off): Ragnarok is another Sony sequel that’s more about increasing scope than radically reinventing itself, but its Norse world is beautifully varied and detailed, smashing baddies with a magic axe feels great, and the whole thing is excessive in the way you’d expect a God of War game to be without going overboard. Horizon Forbidden West for $30 ($40 off): Engadget’s Jess Conditt called Horizon Forbidden West the “total package” in her review a few years back, praising its frenzied combat, gorgeous art direction and complex narrative. It still has one of the more distinctive post-apocalypses in gaming, blending robot beasts with stunning vistas. That helps paper over some less-than-inspired side content and bits of sluggish pacing. Final Fantasy XVI (PS5) for $23 ($7 off): Final Fantasy XVI is a more straightforward action-RPG than something like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth: You don’t need to come in with prior knowledge of any other story, and its hack-and-slash combat is simple to pick up. It can get bogged down in pointless side quests, but its main concern is having you watch giant demigods melodramatically smack each other, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon for $20 ($10 off): Armored Core VI is a big loud action game about building a mech and using it to blow up everything in sight. It rules. But it’s not mindless: Its many boss fights are genuine duels, and it’s deeply flexible in how it lets you tweak your death machine to tackle stages in different ways. This ties the best price we've seen for the PS5 version. Metaphor: ReFantazio (Xbox) for $16 ($54 off): It’s about as subtle as you’d expect a game named “Metaphor” to be, but the latest from the minds behind Persona 5 is a fantasy JRPG through and through: bombastic, stylish and deeply earnest. (And long.) This deal represents a new low, though it only applies to the Xbox copy. Madden NFL 26 for $37 ($33 off): It always feels like Madden could use a creative reset, but at the end of the day, it’s Madden, and it works fine enough if you just want to scratch the pro football game itch. This is the largest discount we’ve seen for the latest entry, and it applies to the PS5, Xbox and Switch 2 copies. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (3-month) for $57 ($33 off): It hasn’t exactly been a great stretch for Xbox lately, what with Microsoft jacking up console prices, laying off huge swaths of employees and massively hiking the cost of its Game Pass service to $30 per month. But if you aren’t looking to cancel your Game Pass subscription as a result, you can still grab three months of the top-end Ultimate tier for a little less than its old going rate. While the service itself may end up being too pricey in the long term, it’s still home to a wide range of games worth checking out, so this offer might be useful if you have some free time coming up and want to blast through a few titles you’ve been meaning to get around to. Astro A50 X gaming headset for $315 ($75 off): The A50 X is an upgrade pick in our guide to the best gaming headsets. It should specifically appeal to those who own multiple gaming systems, as its base station lets you connect and swap between PC, PS5 and Xbox audio with the press of a button. It’s among the better-sounding wireless headsets we’ve tried as well, and its mic is fantastic. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it’s the largest drop we’ve seen since February. The standard Astro A50 is also on sale for $237; that one works just as well if you only play on one device, but it lacks HDMI switching functionality. 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller for $48 ($12 off): The Ultimate 2 is a versatile wireless gamepad for Windows PCs and mobile devices. It can connect over Bluetooth, a wireless dongle or a USB cable, and its magnetic TMR joysticks should be far less susceptible to “joystick drift” than typical controllers. Those with large hands may find it a touch too small, but it’s built well, it comes with a handy charging dock and it gets a solid 20 or so hours of battery life. 8BitDo’s companion software includes a variety of useful customizations beyond that. This isn’t an all-time low, but it’s still a few bucks below the pad’s typical street price. Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite MMO gaming mouse for $55 ($25 off): We recommend the Scimitar RGB Elite to MMO and MOBA players in our guide to the best gaming mice. It’s not the lightest or most technically advanced model, but it comes with 12 comfortable and easy-to-reach side buttons, which make it easier to pull off more complex actions in games like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XIV.

This is its lowest price to date. Note that Razer now sells a newer version with an improved sensor, but that one costs $49 more and isn’t a massive upgrade in real-world use.

For less than $100, it gets you a sturdy yet superlight design that weighs just 55 grams — making it easy to flick around in fast-paced games — and doesn’t have any annoying cutouts in its outer shell. Its contoured shape should fit most small- to medium-sized hands comfortably, and it performs reliably for competitive play. This deal is an all-time low. ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless mechanical keyboard for $151 ($59 off): We speak positively about this model in our guide to the best gaming keyboards. Its sturdy case, crisp keycaps and battery life all impress, while the thocky NX Snow switches in this model feel and sound delightful.

          "standfirst": "No gaming mouse will magically stop you from getting destroyed in Counter-Strike or Call of Duty, but the right pick can give you a greater sense of control while making your downtime more comfortable. In truth, which one is “best” for you comes down to preference: Shape is king, as the mouse nerd adage goes, and everyone’s hands are different. But to make things a little easier, we’ve tested dozens of well-regarded gaming mice over the past couple of years and picked out a few options that have glided above the rest. After playing countless hours of CS2, Overwatch 2, Halo Infinite, Final Fantasy XIV and more PC games, here are our picks for the best gaming mice you can buy, broken down by shape and use case. We’ve also included some general advice to keep in mind during your search. The best gaming mice Other gaming mice we've tested The Lamzu Maya X. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Note: The following is a selection of especially noteworthy mice we've tested, not a comprehensive list of every single model we’ve ever put through its paces. Lamzu Maya X The Lamzu Maya X is a great symmetrical mouse and a close competitor to the Razer Viper V3 Pro. It’d be next in line for an honorable mention, as it has most of the things we like about the Hitscan Hyperlight and Pulsar X2 CrazyLight: a smooth matte finish, a sturdy frame, easy-gliding feet, accurate performance, a tight scroll wheel and a lightweight design (46g). It’s close in size to the Viper V3 Pro, but it’s cheaper at $120, plus it uses the superior Omron optical switches we praised for the Hyperlight above. Its configuration software is also entirely accessible over the web (for Chromium-based browsers at least), so you don’t have to download anything extra to your PC. However, we think the Viper’s longer frame and ever-so-slightly more concave sides keep it just a little comfier for larger hands and palm grips. Its side buttons are still more satisfying to press and its finish provides more grip. The Maya also follows the “leave the entire bottom of your mouse exposed” trend to reach its lower weight. And though the software being web-based is great, it is very much a Chinese Gaming App with grammatical errors and weird formatting quirks. The reality is that fine margins separate high-end gaming mice nowadays — the Maya X is good, but we prefer the Viper at this size, while the Hitscan and CrazyLight are better for smaller hands. Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 The Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 is a close rival to the Razer Viper V3 Pro for those who want a no-frills, high-end wireless gaming mouse. It has a similar “potato”-style shape, its tracking is similarly tremendous and its optical-mechanical switches have a distinct feel. Unlike the first Superlight, it also charges over USB-C. But the Viper’s main clicks are crisper and more pleasant-sounding, its side buttons aren't as mushy and its scroll wheel is both firmer and grippier. It’s also slightly lighter. The Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 DEX The G Pro X Superlight 2 DEX is the ergonomic version of the Superlight 2, packing the same sensor and hybrid switches in a chunkier, right-handed shape. We found its right side to flare out a little too much, though, often leaving our pinky finger in a less-than-comfortable position. Those with average-sized hands may find its center hump to be too aggressive for consistent aiming as well. The DeathAdder V4 Pro’s main buttons are still more invitingly curved and consistent to press beyond that, while its coating isn’t as slippery. The DEX’s scroll wheel is tighter, and all of its internal tech is great, so by no means is this a poor choice. But at $180 after a tariff-related price hike, there are better values out there. Razer Viper V3 HyperSpeed Much like the DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed, Razer’s Viper V3 HyperSpeed is a lower-cost variant of the top-end Viper V3 Pro. (Confusing, we know.) At $70, it’s a solid value. Its symmetrical shape and soft-touch finish are virtually identical to the more premium model, and though it technically has a worse sensor, the drop-off is hardly noticeable. The main trade-off is that it’s heavier (about 82g), as it requires a AA battery for power. That doesn’t make it outright hefty, but you can feel the difference in twitchier games. It uses older mechanical switches and smaller PTFE feet, too, plus it lacks a port for connecting a cable. So it’s not as close to its big sibling as the mid-tier DeathAdder. Some may prefer that its DPI button is located on the top of the mouse, though, and its simpler on-off switch is nice. Razer Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed The Razer Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed is a more affordable wireless version of the Basilisk V3 with the same comfortable shape and layout, plus a quieter scroll wheel. Because it requires a AA battery for power, though, it weighs around 115g. That's not great for fast-paced games. The scroll wheel can’t tilt left or right, either, nor can it switch between a ratcheted and free-spin mode. It also uses less durable mechanical switches and only supports one onboard profile. All that said, it’s a decent value at $70. Left to right: the Logitech G309 Lightspeed, the Razer Viper V3 HyperSpeed and the Pulsar X2 V2. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Pulsar X2 V2 The $100 Pulsar X2 V2 is another decent option if you want a high-performing symmetrical mouse for less than the Viper V3 Pro. It’s available in mini and standard sizes: The former is a technically weightier (51 grams) version of the X2 CrazyLight, while the latter is that but bigger. Both have sturdy plastic frames, though they’re still meant for claw or fingertip grips first. They also have cutouts across their undersides. As with the Xlite V3, Pulsar now sells a newer model called the X2 V3, though that’s a minor refresh with an updated sensor and 8K polling rate support. The latest model is worth getting instead when the X2 V2 isn’t discounted, but we prefer the Hitscan Hyperlight and its more pleasing clicks to both in this price range. Pwnage Stormbreaker The Pwnage Stormbreaker is a superlight (51g), exceptionally sturdy and premium-feeling wireless mouse that’s largely made from magnesium alloy instead of plastic. It performs about on par with our top picks, which is excellent, while its right-handed, medium-sized shape should suit palm and claw grippers well. (If you know BenQ’s Zowie EC line, the shape is basically that.) However, the extensive cutouts all over the sides and top shell are noticeable in the hand and make the device more susceptible to debris buildup than the DeathAdder V4 Pro. While the buttons and scroll wheel are impressively tight, the main clicks are a bit too stiff and high-pitched for our liking. We also noticed more connection stutters than usual on our test PC, and its $169 MSRP is expensive. BenQ Zowie U2 Speaking of BenQ, its Zowie U2 is a perfectly decent alternative to the Viper V3 Pro that costs about $30 less. It tracks great, it’s lightweight (60g) and its mechanical clicks feel fine. It also comes with two receivers, one of which doubles as a handy charging dock. It has a symmetrical shape with sides that curve inwards and a decently-sized hump at the back; BenQ says it’s designed for claw grips, and it is indeed good for that, but it should also work for fingertip grippers with larger hands or palm grippers with smaller ones. Alas, the scroll wheel is gratingly loud, and the plastic coating picks up smudges and hand oils like it’s its job. There’s also no configuration software, which can make adjusting settings a little cumbersome, though some may prefer not having to install any extra bloat on their PC. This mouse also maxes out at a 1,000Hz polling rate — that’s not a big deal in practice, but it's technically behind many other mice in this price range. The Pwnage Stormbreaker (left) and BenQ Zowie U2 (right). Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Logitech G309 Lightspeed There isn’t much wrong with the Logitech G309 Lightspeed in a vacuum. It’s built like a tank, its sensor is accurate and its egg-like shape should feel OK, if not superlative, in most hand sizes and grip types. It uses the same hybrid switches as the G Pro X Superlight 2, so the clicks don’t sound great but are fast. It also has a supercapacitor inside, which gives it effectively infinite battery life if you own Logitech’s (costly) PowerPlay charging mat. That’s neat! Most people, though, will need to pop in a AA battery, which pushes the weight up around 85 grams. As most of that weight is felt toward the back, the mouse can feel relatively clunky to fling around in FPS games. We’re not fans of the ugly recess across the middle of the device, either, as it creates a space for dust to collect. At a $90 MSRP after a recent price hike, the G309 is still OK for casual types who’ll only buy from a name brand. But unless you use PowerPlay, it doesn’t do much to stand out from other options around the same price. HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 The HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 is a decent wired model for those who want a flatter ambidextrous shape. It performs well for competitive play, and it’s plenty light (53g) thanks to a clever design with cutouts on the bottom that are covered by the mouse’s label. But the Endgame Gear OP1 8K V2 is better-built and more comfortable, so we think it’s worth the extra cash. The Razer Viper 8KHz was another solid (albeit heavier) option with a similar shape, but that mouse has been discontinued. A few more gaming mice we've tested. Left to right: the Glorious Model I 2 Wireless, the Razer Cobra Pro, the Razer Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed and the HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Core Wireless The HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Core Wireless is a budget-friendly wireless variant of the Haste 2. It may be OK if you must go wireless and only have $50 to spend, as its shell feels sturdy and its low-profile shape is well-suited to claw or fingertip grips. It’s a little weightier than the wired Haste 2 (about 70g) since it runs on a AAA battery, but that’s nowhere near heavy. That said, its main buttons feel somewhat mushy, and we observed a few sensor hiccups and inconsistencies, particularly when we had HyperX’s Ngenuity software open. HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Pro We had persistent, debilitating connection issues with the HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Pro on both Windows 11 and macOS over multiple days, so we can’t recommend it. Logitech G502 X The Logitech G502 X has a generally similar shape as the Razer Basilisk V3, with a lower weight (84g) and more side buttons. However, its main buttons are noisier, it’s a slightly more awkward fit for most hands and its rubber cable isn’t as flexible. It's also more expensive after Logitech's round of price increases earlier this year, plus it lacks RGB. The HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Pro. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Logitech G203 Lightsync The Logitech G203 Lightsync is our former budget pick. It’s often available in the $20 to $30 range these days, and at that price it’s still fine if you want a competent gaming mouse for as little money as possible. You can feel the cost cutting in its rubbery cable and mushy scroll wheel, however, and its shape is a bit too small and flat for larger hands. The Logitech G305 Lightspeed is a wireless model with more or less the same shape, but it requires a AA battery to work and thus weighs just over 100g. It, too, feels somewhat outdated in 2025. Razer Cobra The Razer Cobra is another value-oriented wired mouse with a compact shape. It’s much lighter (58g) than the Logitech G203, with a more flexible cable and optical switches instead of mechanical ones. It's usually priced between $35 and $40, though, so the G203 typically costs less. The Endgame Gear OP1 8K V2 still feels higher-quality across the board, but if you have smaller hands, use a fingertip grip and want a cheaper symmetrical mouse, go for it. The Logitech G203 Lightsync Jeff Dunn / Engadget Alienware Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse The Alienware Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse tracks well, glides smoothly and weighs just under 60 grams without having any holes in its outer shell. It’s shaped like a Logitech G Pro X Lightspeed 2 with wider sides, so it should be comfortable for palm or claw grippers with large or medium-sized hands. Its matte finish is a touch too slippery, however, and its main buttons aren’t as consistent or satisfying to press as our top picks (despite using Omron optical switches). Clicking them toward the top is too soft, clicking them toward the back is too stiff. The back side button sounds hollow beyond that, and Alienware’s configuration software chews up far too much memory. All of this is overpriced at $150. Glorious Model I 2 Wireless There’s a fair amount to like about the Glorious Model I 2 Wireless: an ergonomic shape that’s reminiscent of the Basilisk V3/G502 X but lighter at 75g, four customizable side buttons, the ability to connect over a USB receiver or Bluetooth, a smooth scroll wheel and tasteful RGB lighting, all for a list price of $100. However, its honeycomb-style design and mechanical switches both raise concerns about its long-term durability. Glorious Model D 2 Wireless The Glorious Model D 2 Wireless also has holes all over its shell yet doesn’t perform or feel significantly better than other mice around the $100 mark. Other reviews say it has latency issues as well. Glorious Model D 2 Pro + Model O 2 Pro The ergonomic Model D 2 Pro and symmetrical Model O 2 Pro aren’t loaded with cutouts, meanwhile, but their main buttons are relatively loud and sticky-feeling. The Alienware Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse. Jeff Dunn for Engadget What to look for in a gaming mouse Wired vs. wireless Buying a wireless gaming mouse used to mean sacrificing a certain level of responsiveness, but thankfully, that’s no longer the case. Over the last few years, wireless connectivity has improved to the point where the difference in latency between a good wireless model and a tried-and-true wired gaming mouse is barely perceptible. Note, however, that we’re strictly talking about mice that use a 2.4GHz connection (over a USB dongle), not Bluetooth. Many of the best wireless gaming mouse models support both connection options, which is great for travel, but Bluetooth’s latency is generally too high to be reliable for gaming. Going wireless still has other trade-offs, too. Battery life is improving all the time, but with their higher performance demands and RGB lighting, most wireless gaming mice usually don't last as long as \"normal\" wireless models. You shouldn’t expect more than a few days of power from a rechargeable gaming mouse you use regularly. Some gaming mice offer wireless charging too, which makes things easier. Good wireless gaming mice usually come at a much higher cost than their wired counterparts as well. That’s not to say the premium is never worth it: Who wants yet another cable on their desk? You may need a wireless model if you hate the feel of “cable drag” or if your gaming PC is located in an awkward spot. Many wireless gaming mice come with a cable you can hook up in a pinch as well. But if price is your primary concern, a good wired mouse may be a better value. Comfort and grip types Everyone’s hands are different, so at the end of the day, calling one mouse “more comfortable” than another is mostly subjective. Ensuring your comfort is the most essential step when buying any mouse, though, so we’ve done our best to consider how each device we tested works with smaller, average-sized and larger hands alike. We also considered how each peripheral accommodates the three grip styles most people use while holding a mouse: palm, fingertip and claw. As a refresher, a palm grip is when your whole hand rests on the mouse, with your fingers resting flat on the main buttons. A fingertip grip is when you steer the mouse solely with the tips of your fingers, with your palm not in contact with the device at all. A claw grip is when your palm only touches the back edge of the mouse, with your fingers arched in a claw-like shape toward the buttons. In general, most people use a palm grip, which tends to offer the greatest sense of control — though, depending on the size of your hand, you may need your mouse to be a specific length to use it comfortably. A fingertip grip can allow for more rapid movements, while a claw grip is something of a balance between the two. Switch and Click has a good breakdown if you’d like more detail, but we’ve noted above if a mouse isn’t well-suited for a particular grip style. For what it’s worth, yours truly is a claw gripper most of the time. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Build quality and design A good gaming mouse feels sturdy and won’t flex or creak when used strenuously. We valued mice without any overly sharp angles or grooves that could be awkward for most people to hold. And while most gaming mice have plastic exteriors, not all plastic is created equal, so we looked for finishes that were smooth, not too slick and capable of withstanding the sweaty palms that often come with competitive gaming sessions. The gaming mouse market is mostly split between two design styles: ergonomic and ambidextrous. Ergonomic mice are almost always made with right-handed users in mind and often feature dedicated thumb rests. Ambidextrous mice are more symmetrical and designed to be used with either hand (though they may not have extra buttons on both sides). Whether an ergonomic or ambidextrous gaming mouse works best for you is largely a matter of personal preference. A gaming mouse’s feet, meanwhile, should provide a consistent glide and reduce the friction between your mouse and mouse pad beneath it as much as possible. For the best performance, look for feet made from PTFE (aka Teflon). All feet will eventually wear down, but many mice come with spares, and most manufacturers sell replacements if needed. As for flashy RGB lighting, it’s a nice bonus, but little more than that. Still, if you’ve already kitted out your setup with RGB, having a mouse with adjustable lighting effects can add to the gaming experience (and more consumer tech could stand to do things for pleasure’s sake). More practically, some mice let you assign custom lighting settings to separate profiles, which can make it easier to see which one you’re currently using. Weight Gaming mice have gotten lighter and lighter over the years, with some recent releases weighing less than 30 grams. Your mouse doesn’t need to be that feathery — anything under 80g is still reasonably light, and it’s not like a 100g mouse feels like a total anchor. Regardless, a lightweight mouse makes it easier to pull off fast movements repeatedly, with less inertia. That said, some players still enjoy a little bit of bulk in their gaming mouse (relatively speaking), especially with games that aren’t as reliant on twitchy reactions. To reach those lightest weights, some manufacturers have released gaming mice with “honeycomb”-style designs, which feature an array of cutouts in the outer shell. These mice can still perform great, but having a bunch of holes that expose the internal circuit board to possible sweat, dust and detritus isn’t the best for long-term durability. If a mouse must have cutouts, it's better if they're relegated to the bottom of the design, where debris is less likely to enter the frame. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Switches, buttons and scroll wheel A growing number of gaming mice use optical switches instead of mechanical ones. Since these involve fewer bits making physical contact, they should generally be more durable and less prone to unwanted “double-clicks” over time. Many gamers still find good mechanical switches more satisfying to press, so it's not like you should avoid mechanical mice altogether. They just carry a little more long-term risk in a vacuum. Since most people will use their gaming mouse as their mouse-mouse, you may want main buttons that have a softer feel when pressed, with enough travel to make inadvertent actuations less frequent. But even that is a matter of preference: You may want lighter buttons if you play games that call for constant clicking. We also looked to testing from sites like Rtings to ensure each mouse we recommend has a sufficiently low click latency, meaning your clicks will register with minimal lag. Beyond the standard click panels, a good gaming mouse should also have programmable buttons for quick macros or shortcuts. For most games, shoot for at least two extra buttons on the thumb-side panel that are easy to reach and difficult to press by accident. Many mice have more buttons, which can be a plus, but not if they force you to contort your fingers to avoid hitting them. For MMO mice, having at least 12 side buttons is preferable in order to access as many hotbar commands as possible. As for the scroll wheel, it should have distinct, ratcheted “steps” that aren’t too resistant but make it clear when you’ve actually scrolled. Its texture should be grippy, and it shouldn't make a distracting amount of noise when used. The wheel should also be clickable, giving you another input to customize for certain games (e.g., to control the zoom on a sniper rifle). Sensors and performance Some are more proficient than others, but generally speaking, the optical sensors built into most modern gaming mice are more than fast and accurate enough for most people’s needs. While shopping for gaming mice, you’ll see a number of terms related to sensor performance. To be clear, a gaming mouse’s responsiveness doesn’t come down to just one spec. But for clarity’s sake, here’s a rundown of the more noteworthy jargon: DPI, or dots per inch, is a measure of a mouse’s sensitivity. The higher the DPI setting, the more your cursor will move with every inch you move the mouse itself. Many gaming mice advertise extremely high DPIs that top out above 30,000, but that’s largely marketing fluff: Few people play above 3,000, with 800 a common sweet spot. This concept is also referred to as CPI (counts per inch), which is probably the more accurate term, though DPI is used more often. IPS, or inches per second, refers to the maximum velocity a mouse sensor supports. The higher the IPS, the faster you can move the mouse before it becomes incapable of tracking motions correctly. Acceleration goes with IPS. In this context, it refers to how many Gs a mouse can withstand before it starts to track inaccurately. Polling rate is a measure of how often a mouse tells a computer where it is. In general, the more frequently your mouse reports information to your PC, the more predictable its response time should be. Anything at 500Hz or above is fine for casual gaming. A sweet spot for most is 1,000Hz. Many newer mice can go all the way up to 8,000Hz, but you start to see diminishing returns the higher you go unless own a powerful PC and play on a gaming monitor with an especially high refresh rate. Even then, a super-high polling rate is far from essential. Not all games are built with it in mind, plus it leads to much faster battery drain. Lift-off distance is the height at which a mouse’s sensor stops tracking the surface below it. Many competitive players like this to be as low as possible in order to avoid unintended cursor movements while repositioning their mouse. A screenshot of Razer's Synapse 4 software. Razer Software and onboard memory It doesn’t take long to find horror stories about bugs and other niggling issues caused by gaming mouse software, so the ideal app is one that doesn’t force you to use it all the time. It should let you adjust as many of the aspects above as possible, ideally to several distinct profiles. Preferably, you can save your settings directly to the mouse itself, letting you pick your customizations back up on another device without having to redownload any software. All this is most important on Windows, but Mac compatibility is always good to have. Warranty and customer support Most major gaming mice brands offer warranties between one and three years. The longer and more extensive a manufacturer’s program is, the better. This is the case with most consumer tech, but we note it here because the gaming mouse market is particularly flush with products from less-than-household names, many of which you may see hyped up on YouTube, Reddit or elsewhere around the web. A bunch of these more obscure mice are genuinely great, but if you ever buy from a more niche brand, it’s worth checking that some level of customer support is in place. We’ve made sure our picks for the best gaming mice aren’t riddled with an abnormal amount of poor user reviews. Recent updates October 2025: The Razer DeathAdder V4 Pro replaces the last-gen DeathAdder V3 Pro as our top ergonomic pick, while the lightly updated Endgame Gear OP1 8K V2 supplants its predecessor as one of our favorite wired mice. We’ve edited a few other blurbs to reflect these changes as well. June 2025: We’ve added a couple new alternate picks in the Hitscan Hyperlight and Pulsar X2 CrazyLight. We’ve removed the Lamzu Atlantis OG V2 4K as an honorable mention as a result, along with a couple other mice that no longer appear to be available. All other details should be up-to-date. The gaming mouse market remains an extremely busy one, so it’s difficult for us to review everything. That said, we’re currently testing a few other recent releases, and we’re keeping an eye out for potential updates to a couple of our picks from Razer and Endgame Gear. November 2024: We’ve updated this guide with testing notes on the Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 DEX. We’ve also added mentions of the Razer Basilisk V3 35K and Pulsar Xlite V4, two recently released updates to a couple of our current picks. We aim to test those more fully, alongside a few others, for our next update. September 2024: We've completely refreshed this guide for late 2024, adding new main picks based on shape alongside notes on several other gaming mice we've tested in recent months. We're now in the process of testing Logitech's new G Pro X Superlight 2 DEX, a flagship ergonomic mouse that the company announced right as we were putting the finishing touches on this update.

          "content": "No gaming mouse will magically stop you from getting destroyed in Counter-Strike or Call of Duty, but the right pick can give you a greater sense of control while making your downtime more comfortable. In truth, which one is “best” for you comes down to preference: Shape is king, as the mouse nerd adage goes, and everyone’s hands are different. But to make things a little easier, we’ve tested dozens of well-regarded gaming mice over the past couple of years and picked out a few options that have glided above the rest. After playing countless hours of CS2, Overwatch 2, Halo Infinite, Final Fantasy XIV and more PC games, here are our picks for the best gaming mice you can buy, broken down by shape and use case. We’ve also included some general advice to keep in mind during your search. The best gaming mice Other gaming mice we've tested The Lamzu Maya X. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Note: The following is a selection of especially noteworthy mice we've tested, not a comprehensive list of every single model we’ve ever put through its paces. Lamzu Maya X The Lamzu Maya X is a great symmetrical mouse and a close competitor to the Razer Viper V3 Pro. It’d be next in line for an honorable mention, as it has most of the things we like about the Hitscan Hyperlight and Pulsar X2 CrazyLight: a smooth matte finish, a sturdy frame, easy-gliding feet, accurate performance, a tight scroll wheel and a lightweight design (46g). It’s close in size to the Viper V3 Pro, but it’s cheaper at $120, plus it uses the superior Omron optical switches we praised for the Hyperlight above. Its configuration software is also entirely accessible over the web (for Chromium-based browsers at least), so you don’t have to download anything extra to your PC. However, we think the Viper’s longer frame and ever-so-slightly more concave sides keep it just a little comfier for larger hands and palm grips. Its side buttons are still more satisfying to press and its finish provides more grip. The Maya also follows the “leave the entire bottom of your mouse exposed” trend to reach its lower weight. And though the software being web-based is great, it is very much a Chinese Gaming App with grammatical errors and weird formatting quirks. The reality is that fine margins separate high-end gaming mice nowadays — the Maya X is good, but we prefer the Viper at this size, while the Hitscan and CrazyLight are better for smaller hands. Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 The Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 is a close rival to the Razer Viper V3 Pro for those who want a no-frills, high-end wireless gaming mouse. It has a similar “potato”-style shape, its tracking is similarly tremendous and its optical-mechanical switches have a distinct feel. Unlike the first Superlight, it also charges over USB-C. But the Viper’s main clicks are crisper and more pleasant-sounding, its side buttons aren't as mushy and its scroll wheel is both firmer and grippier. It’s also slightly lighter. The Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 DEX The G Pro X Superlight 2 DEX is the ergonomic version of the Superlight 2, packing the same sensor and hybrid switches in a chunkier, right-handed shape. We found its right side to flare out a little too much, though, often leaving our pinky finger in a less-than-comfortable position. Those with average-sized hands may find its center hump to be too aggressive for consistent aiming as well. The DeathAdder V4 Pro’s main buttons are still more invitingly curved and consistent to press beyond that, while its coating isn’t as slippery. The DEX’s scroll wheel is tighter, and all of its internal tech is great, so by no means is this a poor choice. But at $180 after a tariff-related price hike, there are better values out there. Razer Viper V3 HyperSpeed Much like the DeathAdder V3 HyperSpeed, Razer’s Viper V3 HyperSpeed is a lower-cost variant of the top-end Viper V3 Pro. (Confusing, we know.) At $70, it’s a solid value. Its symmetrical shape and soft-touch finish are virtually identical to the more premium model, and though it technically has a worse sensor, the drop-off is hardly noticeable. The main trade-off is that it’s heavier (about 82g), as it requires a AA battery for power. That doesn’t make it outright hefty, but you can feel the difference in twitchier games. It uses older mechanical switches and smaller PTFE feet, too, plus it lacks a port for connecting a cable. So it’s not as close to its big sibling as the mid-tier DeathAdder. Some may prefer that its DPI button is located on the top of the mouse, though, and its simpler on-off switch is nice. Razer Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed The Razer Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed is a more affordable wireless version of the Basilisk V3 with the same comfortable shape and layout, plus a quieter scroll wheel. Because it requires a AA battery for power, though, it weighs around 115g. That's not great for fast-paced games. The scroll wheel can’t tilt left or right, either, nor can it switch between a ratcheted and free-spin mode. It also uses less durable mechanical switches and only supports one onboard profile. All that said, it’s a decent value at $70. Left to right: the Logitech G309 Lightspeed, the Razer Viper V3 HyperSpeed and the Pulsar X2 V2. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Pulsar X2 V2 The $100 Pulsar X2 V2 is another decent option if you want a high-performing symmetrical mouse for less than the Viper V3 Pro. It’s available in mini and standard sizes: The former is a technically weightier (51 grams) version of the X2 CrazyLight, while the latter is that but bigger. Both have sturdy plastic frames, though they’re still meant for claw or fingertip grips first. They also have cutouts across their undersides. As with the Xlite V3, Pulsar now sells a newer model called the X2 V3, though that’s a minor refresh with an updated sensor and 8K polling rate support. The latest model is worth getting instead when the X2 V2 isn’t discounted, but we prefer the Hitscan Hyperlight and its more pleasing clicks to both in this price range. Pwnage Stormbreaker The Pwnage Stormbreaker is a superlight (51g), exceptionally sturdy and premium-feeling wireless mouse that’s largely made from magnesium alloy instead of plastic. It performs about on par with our top picks, which is excellent, while its right-handed, medium-sized shape should suit palm and claw grippers well. (If you know BenQ’s Zowie EC line, the shape is basically that.) However, the extensive cutouts all over the sides and top shell are noticeable in the hand and make the device more susceptible to debris buildup than the DeathAdder V4 Pro. While the buttons and scroll wheel are impressively tight, the main clicks are a bit too stiff and high-pitched for our liking. We also noticed more connection stutters than usual on our test PC, and its $169 MSRP is expensive. BenQ Zowie U2 Speaking of BenQ, its Zowie U2 is a perfectly decent alternative to the Viper V3 Pro that costs about $30 less. It tracks great, it’s lightweight (60g) and its mechanical clicks feel fine. It also comes with two receivers, one of which doubles as a handy charging dock. It has a symmetrical shape with sides that curve inwards and a decently-sized hump at the back; BenQ says it’s designed for claw grips, and it is indeed good for that, but it should also work for fingertip grippers with larger hands or palm grippers with smaller ones. Alas, the scroll wheel is gratingly loud, and the plastic coating picks up smudges and hand oils like it’s its job. There’s also no configuration software, which can make adjusting settings a little cumbersome, though some may prefer not having to install any extra bloat on their PC. This mouse also maxes out at a 1,000Hz polling rate — that’s not a big deal in practice, but it's technically behind many other mice in this price range. The Pwnage Stormbreaker (left) and BenQ Zowie U2 (right). Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget Logitech G309 Lightspeed There isn’t much wrong with the Logitech G309 Lightspeed in a vacuum. It’s built like a tank, its sensor is accurate and its egg-like shape should feel OK, if not superlative, in most hand sizes and grip types. It uses the same hybrid switches as the G Pro X Superlight 2, so the clicks don’t sound great but are fast. It also has a supercapacitor inside, which gives it effectively infinite battery life if you own Logitech’s (costly) PowerPlay charging mat. That’s neat! Most people, though, will need to pop in a AA battery, which pushes the weight up around 85 grams. As most of that weight is felt toward the back, the mouse can feel relatively clunky to fling around in FPS games. We’re not fans of the ugly recess across the middle of the device, either, as it creates a space for dust to collect. At a $90 MSRP after a recent price hike, the G309 is still OK for casual types who’ll only buy from a name brand. But unless you use PowerPlay, it doesn’t do much to stand out from other options around the same price. HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 The HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 is a decent wired model for those who want a flatter ambidextrous shape. It performs well for competitive play, and it’s plenty light (53g) thanks to a clever design with cutouts on the bottom that are covered by the mouse’s label. But the Endgame Gear OP1 8K V2 is better-built and more comfortable, so we think it’s worth the extra cash. The Razer Viper 8KHz was another solid (albeit heavier) option with a similar shape, but that mouse has been discontinued. A few more gaming mice we've tested. Left to right: the Glorious Model I 2 Wireless, the Razer Cobra Pro, the Razer Basilisk V3 X HyperSpeed and the HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2. Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Core Wireless The HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Core Wireless is a budget-friendly wireless variant of the Haste 2. It may be OK if you must go wireless and only have $50 to spend, as its shell feels sturdy and its low-profile shape is well-suited to claw or fingertip grips. It’s a little weightier than the wired Haste 2 (about 70g) since it runs on a AAA battery, but that’s nowhere near heavy. That said, its main buttons feel somewhat mushy, and we observed a few sensor hiccups and inconsistencies, particularly when we had HyperX’s Ngenuity software open. HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Pro We had persistent, debilitating connection issues with the HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Pro on both Windows 11 and macOS over multiple days, so we can’t recommend it. Logitech G502 X The Logitech G502 X has a generally similar shape as the Razer Basilisk V3, with a lower weight (84g) and more side buttons. However, its main buttons are noisier, it’s a slightly more awkward fit for most hands and its rubber cable isn’t as flexible. It's also more expensive after Logitech's round of price increases earlier this year, plus it lacks RGB. The HyperX Pulsefire Haste 2 Pro. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Logitech G203 Lightsync The Logitech G203 Lightsync is our former budget pick. It’s often available in the $20 to $30 range these days, and at that price it’s still fine if you want a competent gaming mouse for as little money as possible. You can feel the cost cutting in its rubbery cable and mushy scroll wheel, however, and its shape is a bit too small and flat for larger hands. The Logitech G305 Lightspeed is a wireless model with more or less the same shape, but it requires a AA battery to work and thus weighs just over 100g. It, too, feels somewhat outdated in 2025. Razer Cobra The Razer Cobra is another value-oriented wired mouse with a compact shape. It’s much lighter (58g) than the Logitech G203, with a more flexible cable and optical switches instead of mechanical ones. It's usually priced between $35 and $40, though, so the G203 typically costs less. The Endgame Gear OP1 8K V2 still feels higher-quality across the board, but if you have smaller hands, use a fingertip grip and want a cheaper symmetrical mouse, go for it. The Logitech G203 Lightsync Jeff Dunn / Engadget Alienware Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse The Alienware Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse tracks well, glides smoothly and weighs just under 60 grams without having any holes in its outer shell. It’s shaped like a Logitech G Pro X Lightspeed 2 with wider sides, so it should be comfortable for palm or claw grippers with large or medium-sized hands. Its matte finish is a touch too slippery, however, and its main buttons aren’t as consistent or satisfying to press as our top picks (despite using Omron optical switches). Clicking them toward the top is too soft, clicking them toward the back is too stiff. The back side button sounds hollow beyond that, and Alienware’s configuration software chews up far too much memory. All of this is overpriced at $150. Glorious Model I 2 Wireless There’s a fair amount to like about the Glorious Model I 2 Wireless: an ergonomic shape that’s reminiscent of the Basilisk V3/G502 X but lighter at 75g, four customizable side buttons, the ability to connect over a USB receiver or Bluetooth, a smooth scroll wheel and tasteful RGB lighting, all for a list price of $100. However, its honeycomb-style design and mechanical switches both raise concerns about its long-term durability. Glorious Model D 2 Wireless The Glorious Model D 2 Wireless also has holes all over its shell yet doesn’t perform or feel significantly better than other mice around the $100 mark. Other reviews say it has latency issues as well. Glorious Model D 2 Pro + Model O 2 Pro The ergonomic Model D 2 Pro and symmetrical Model O 2 Pro aren’t loaded with cutouts, meanwhile, but their main buttons are relatively loud and sticky-feeling. The Alienware Pro Wireless Gaming Mouse. Jeff Dunn for Engadget What to look for in a gaming mouse Wired vs. wireless Buying a wireless gaming mouse used to mean sacrificing a certain level of responsiveness, but thankfully, that’s no longer the case. Over the last few years, wireless connectivity has improved to the point where the difference in latency between a good wireless model and a tried-and-true wired gaming mouse is barely perceptible. Note, however, that we’re strictly talking about mice that use a 2.4GHz connection (over a USB dongle), not Bluetooth. Many of the best wireless gaming mouse models support both connection options, which is great for travel, but Bluetooth’s latency is generally too high to be reliable for gaming. Going wireless still has other trade-offs, too. Battery life is improving all the time, but with their higher performance demands and RGB lighting, most wireless gaming mice usually don't last as long as \"normal\" wireless models. You shouldn’t expect more than a few days of power from a rechargeable gaming mouse you use regularly. Some gaming mice offer wireless charging too, which makes things easier. Good wireless gaming mice usually come at a much higher cost than their wired counterparts as well. That’s not to say the premium is never worth it: Who wants yet another cable on their desk? You may need a wireless model if you hate the feel of “cable drag” or if your gaming PC is located in an awkward spot. Many wireless gaming mice come with a cable you can hook up in a pinch as well. But if price is your primary concern, a good wired mouse may be a better value. Comfort and grip types Everyone’s hands are different, so at the end of the day, calling one mouse “more comfortable” than another is mostly subjective. Ensuring your comfort is the most essential step when buying any mouse, though, so we’ve done our best to consider how each device we tested works with smaller, average-sized and larger hands alike. We also considered how each peripheral accommodates the three grip styles most people use while holding a mouse: palm, fingertip and claw. As a refresher, a palm grip is when your whole hand rests on the mouse, with your fingers resting flat on the main buttons. A fingertip grip is when you steer the mouse solely with the tips of your fingers, with your palm not in contact with the device at all. A claw grip is when your palm only touches the back edge of the mouse, with your fingers arched in a claw-like shape toward the buttons. In general, most people use a palm grip, which tends to offer the greatest sense of control — though, depending on the size of your hand, you may need your mouse to be a specific length to use it comfortably. A fingertip grip can allow for more rapid movements, while a claw grip is something of a balance between the two. Switch and Click has a good breakdown if you’d like more detail, but we’ve noted above if a mouse isn’t well-suited for a particular grip style. For what it’s worth, yours truly is a claw gripper most of the time. Jeff Dunn for Engadget Build quality and design A good gaming mouse feels sturdy and won’t flex or creak when used strenuously. We valued mice without any overly sharp angles or grooves that could be awkward for most people to hold.

For most games, shoot for at least two extra buttons on the thumb-side panel that are easy to reach and difficult to press by accident. Many mice have more buttons, which can be a plus, but not if they force you to contort your fingers to avoid hitting them. For MMO mice, having at least 12 side buttons is preferable in order to access as many hotbar commands as possible. As for the scroll wheel, it should have distinct, ratcheted “steps” that aren’t too resistant but make it clear when you’ve actually scrolled. Its texture should be grippy, and it shouldn't make a distracting amount of noise when used. The wheel should also be clickable, giving you another input to customize for certain games (e.g., to control the zoom on a sniper rifle).

This is the case with most consumer tech, but we note it here because the gaming mouse market is particularly flush with products from less-than-household names, many of which you may see hyped up on YouTube, Reddit or elsewhere around the web. A bunch of these more obscure mice are genuinely great, but if you ever buy from a more niche brand, it’s worth checking that some level of customer support is in place. We’ve made sure our picks for the best gaming mice aren’t riddled with an abnormal amount of poor user reviews. Recent updates October 2025: The Razer DeathAdder V4 Pro replaces the last-gen DeathAdder V3 Pro as our top ergonomic pick, while the lightly updated Endgame Gear OP1 8K V2 supplants its predecessor as one of our favorite wired mice. We’ve edited a few other blurbs to reflect these changes as well. June 2025: We’ve added a couple new alternate picks in the Hitscan Hyperlight and Pulsar X2 CrazyLight. We’ve removed the Lamzu Atlantis OG V2 4K as an honorable mention as a result, along with a couple other mice that no longer appear to be available. All other details should be up-to-date. The gaming mouse market remains an extremely busy one, so it’s difficult for us to review everything. That said, we’re currently testing a few other recent releases, and we’re keeping an eye out for potential updates to a couple of our picks from Razer and Endgame Gear. November 2024: We’ve updated this guide with testing notes on the Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 DEX. We’ve also added mentions of the Razer Basilisk V3 35K and Pulsar Xlite V4, two recently released updates to a couple of our current picks. We aim to test those more fully, alongside a few others, for our next update. September 2024: We've completely refreshed this guide for late 2024, adding new main picks based on shape alongside notes on several other gaming mice we've tested in recent months. We're now in the process of testing Logitech's new G Pro X Superlight 2 DEX, a flagship ergonomic mouse that the company announced right as we were putting the finishing touches on this update.

          "standfirst": "This is technically the third Prime-related sale of the year, after March’s spring sale and the official Prime Day in July. Amazon calls this one Prime Big Deal Days, but to you, me and most everyone else, it’s the October Prime Day sale. The deals stretch across every department, but this guide covers tech and gadgets that go for under $50 after the discount. And these aren’t just any gadgets — here you’ll find the batteries, mice, earbuds, speakers, wall chargers and other accessories that the Engadget team has tested for our guides and reviews. We’ve even linked to our coverage so you can see why we recommend a particular deal. Here’s Engadget’s guide to the best Prime Day tech deals for under $50. Best Prime Day deals under $50 Apple MagSafe charger (25W, 2m) for $43 ($6 off): The latest version of Apple's MagSafe puck is Qi2.2-certified and supports up to 25W of wireless power when paired with a 30W adapter. The two-meter cable length on this particular model gives you more flexibility on where you can use it: in bed, on the couch, at your desk and elsewhere. Audible subscription (three months) for $3 ($42 off): From now through mid-December, you can get Amazon’s audiobook subscription for just a dollar a month for three months. Note that it will auto-renew at $15 per month after that, but you can cancel at any point. Moft Folding Sit-Stand Laptop Stand for $48 ($12 off with Prime): I take this with me when I have to work someplace away from my standing desk. It holds a 16-inch MacBook Pro 10 inches off a desk, which is just enough for you to stand up and work. It also configures into four other positions for better ergonomics as you sit. It’s one of our favorite MacBook accessories. UGREEN Nexode Pro 65W USB-C Flat Charger for $43 ($13 off with Prime): One of our picks from our guide to fast chargers, this Ugreen fella has three ports (one of which is USB-A) and a 65-watt max power output. The folding prongs make it even more compact. Just note that it’s a bit wide and may block adjacent outlets in a crowded power strip. UGreen Revodok Pro 109 USB-C Hub for $37 ($18 off): The top pick in our guide to the best USB-C hubs has a good array of ports, including an HDMI 2.0 connection that supports 4K monitors at 60Hz, plus three USB-A ports, Ethernet and one USB-C (plus another for delivering 90W of power to your device. Anker Nano Charger, USB-C 30W charger for $13 ($4 off with Prime): Here’s a tiny but mighty wall adapter that we like for iPhones (but it would work for an iPad too). It can pass on 30 watts of power to your device and looks nice doing it in five different pearlescent shades. Instant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn’t take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen. Elgato Stream Deck Mini for $50 ($10 off with Prime): We like Elgato gear for game streaming, but the handy shortcut deck can also be used for your nine to five. This six-button box can give you better control over PowerPoint presentations, video conferencing calls and spreadsheet wrangling. INIU MagSafe Qi2 power bank for $34 ($16 off with Prime): This is the budget pick in our guide to the best MagSafe batteries. Not only can it refuel a dying iPhone (12 or newer) wirelessly, it comes with its own USB-C cable (that doubles as a handy carrying strap) so you can charge up other devices, too. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 ($20 off): Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Wi-Fi 6E with double the storage of cheaper Fire TV sticks. It earned an honorable mention in our guide to streaming devices and also happens to make a good retro gaming emulator. Lego Icons Dried Flower Centerpiece for $35 ($15 off with Prime): Who doesn’t love a good Lego set? Only people who don’t like fun. This floral centerpiece looks good enough to stick on a dining table and it’ll never die. Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar 2025 for $31 (30 percent off): 'Tis the season for advent calendars. They've flooded the internet, as they usually do this time of year, and there are plenty to choose from (and stock up on) before we get to December. Lego has a bunch, and this Star Wars one will be fun for everyone, not just kids, to open up each day at the end of the year. —> Check out more sets in our Prime Day guide to Lego deals. Anker USB-C to USB-C cable (10FT, 100W) for $9 ($3 off with Prime): Having a bad cable is almost as bad as not having a cable at all. We’re big fans of Anker’s cords. This one is a generous 10 feet and can deliver up to 100W of power. While it can transfer data, it does so slowly, so don’t grab this one for that purpose. This is $1 more than it sold for as a Prime-exclusive in July. Chipolo Pop Bluetooth tracker for $25 ($4 off): If you lose stuff, stop it with a Bluetooth tracker like this. The Pop is our top pick in our guide. It works with either Apple’s Find My app or Google’s Find Hub app, calling on iPhone or Android phone users respectively to anonymously ping your lost stuff so you can find it. Pebblebee Clip Universal for $25 ($10 off with Prime): This is our runner up pick for a rechargeable Bluetooth tracker. It’s ear-splittingly loud, has bright flashing LEDs and works with either Google or Apple’s finding networks. Blink Video Doorbell for $35 ($35 off): True, Amazon just announced new Blink devices, but those won’t hit the market until after Prime Day is over. If you want a video doorbell right now at an impressively low price, this should serve. We’ve tested Blink security devices before and have been impressed by what you get for such a small price. Blink Video Doorbell & Blink Mini 2 for $40 ($70 off): Here’s a bundle that combines a Blink Doorbell and a Mini 2 security camera. But again, new Blink cameras are on their way, so only get this if you're ok with last year’s tech. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off): At $49.99 this juuust qualifies as an under $50 tech deal. If you don’t have doorbell wires at your front entrance, you can still have a camera to capture all the package deliveries and neighborhood animal sightings with the Ring Battery Doorbell. It records video in HD with more vertical coverage than the last model, so you can see people from head to toe. Just note that newer Ring devices are on the way. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off): This is currently the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (three-pack) for $50 ($50 off): A three pack is also on sale and squeezes in just under the $50 mark. Or you can just get one camera for $20. —> Want spend no more than $25 on this sale? Check out our list of the super cheap stuff. Anker 622 5K magnetic power bank with stand for $28 ($20 off with Prime): This 0.5-inch thick power bank attaches magnetically to iPhones and won't get in your way when you're using your phone. It also has a built-in stand so you can watch videos, make FaceTime calls and more hands-free while your phone is powering up. J-Tech Digital Ergonomic Mouse for $17 ($7 off with Prime): This is the budget pick in our ergonomic mouse guide thanks to its vertical format, programmable buttons and nifty RBC lights (which you can turn off). Razer Basilisk V3 gaming mouse for $30 ($40 off): Some prefer a wired connection when playing games. Razer’s Basilisk V3 is our top budget pick for a wired mouse in our gaming mouse guide. It’s comfortable, well-built, accurate and a good value — particularly with a Prime Day discount. OtterBox Made for Kids Case for iPad (A16) for $49 ($21 off with Prime): Where other cases failed, this one has managed to keep my third grader’s iPad alive and functioning. It’ll fit the newest standard iPad or the 10th generation model that came before it. Ring Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events. Just note that a new Ring indoor model was just announced. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener. Ultimate Ears MINIROLL Bluetooth speaker for $48 ($32 off with Prime): Ultimate Ears speakers make a couple of appearances in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. The Miniroll is the smaller sibling of the UE Wonderboom. You’ll sacrifice a little in the sound department, but it maintains a similarly durable waterproof and dustproof build. Anker Nano 3-in-1 Portable Charger for $32 ($13 off with Prime): It’s a wall charger! It’s a portable battery! It has its own USB-C cable! In short, this handy power bank is clever and compact, which is why it’s one of our favorites. Anker Nano portable charger for $20 ($10 off with Prime): It looks like an oldy timey lipstick case and can deliver a partial refill to any small device with a USB-C port. We named it a good pick after testing it for our battery guide. Twelve South AirFly SE for $28 ($12 off with Prime): We recommend this in our father’s day gift guide and a couple of our travel guides. If you know you’re travelling on a plane with screens in the backs of the seats, you may want Twelve South’s gadget. It lets you connect your wireless earbuds to the aux jack. Also a good pick for gym equipment. Levoit Mini Core-P air purifier for $40 ($10 off with Prime): This is the mini version of the top pick in our guide to air purifiers. It has a three-stage filter (pre, activated carbon and particle filters) though that particle filter is not a true HEPA filter. But it’s rated at 250 square feet and can help clear the air in your office or other small room. 8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth controller (Switch 2) for $43 ($27 off with Prime): If you’ve got a Switch 2 and are looking for a good controller to go with it, we think this is a good one. Recommended in our guide to the best Switch 2 accessories, it’s got an Xbox style configuration with the left stick placed higher on the game pad, which some prefer. The lowest price we tracked before this is $50. Anker 555 USB-C Hub for $36 ($14 off with Prime): To give your iPad (or even your laptop) more connection options, pick up this USB-C hub. It’s the model we liked best for our guide to MacBook accessories and adds an HDMI port, an SD card reader, Ethernet jack and two USB-A ports. It also has one data USB-C port and a pass through power delivery USB-C port, along with a built-in USB-C cable. Echo Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year. Elden Ring (PS5) for $30 ($20 off): If you somehow haven’t yet played the action-RPG Elden Ring, here’s a chance to do so for less money. It’s challenging yet accessible if you want plus it’s darkly funny and one of our favorite games. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5) for $35 ($15 off): We gave this game a favorable review last year. But just note that you’ll get more out of it if you’ve played Final Fantasy 7 Remake. —> For more video game deals, check out Engadget's gaming deals roundup. Belkin Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2 for $25 ($5 off with Prime): While this model doesn’t have the battery pack like Belkin’s charging case that we reviewed, it will still offer more than enough protection for everyday bumps and tumbles just like its more expensive counterpart. Belkin Apple AirTag holder for $15 ($5 off with Prime): The best thing about Apple’s AirTags are their ability to rope in most any nearby iPhone to anonymously hunt for lost trackers. The worst thing is probably the tiny, slippery disk shape that can’t attach to anything without some help. This is the help we suggest in our iPhone accessories guide. Ultimate Ears Wonderboom Play speaker for $48 ($42 off with Prime): This is a relative of the Wonderboom 4, one of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. It only has one driver and passive radiator, while the Wonderboom 4 has two of each. The battery life isn’t quite as long here, either (10 hours compared to 14). But this one is currently half the price of its sibling. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): We named this thumbdrive one of the best SSDs you can buy. This configuration has 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS with this device. The best thing about Roku streaming sticks is the access to all the free content — so this is an affordable way to get it. Belkin 45W Dual USB C Charger Block for $29 ($11 off with Prime): Members of my family fight over this handy wall charger. It has exactly what you need, two USB-C ports and speedy, 45W charging, perfect for juicing up a phone and tablet in tandem. Leebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $38 ($32 off with Prime): This is an updated version of the electric scrubber we love that makes shower cleaning easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C. Blink Outdoor 4 security camera for $35 ($45 off): We named this the best choice for Alexa users in our guide to security cameras. It works seamlessly with Alexa devices like the Echo speakers and Show displays. Plus it can run for up to two years on a set of AA batteries and we found the motion detection to be spot on. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $23 ($12 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off with Prime): This small speaker was a past pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. It’s waterproof and goes for 24 hours on a charge. We found the sound to be surprisingly big for its size. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design and improved speakers. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. It went as low as $45 for Black Friday last year. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam $40 ($20 off): If you like the idea of being able to move the camera around to follow the action in your home, you may want to get a pan-and-tilt option like this one. We will again note that new Ring devices are on the way, but if you don’t have to have the latest thing and just want to see what your dog gets up to while you’re gone, you may want to snag this 33 percent discount. Anker Soundcore Space A40 for $43 ($37 off with Prime): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity. JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 ($12 off with Prime): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-include-sales-from-anker-ring-lego-roku-and-others-120531317.html?src=rss",

Also a good pick for gym equipment. Levoit Mini Core-P air purifier for $40 ($10 off with Prime): This is the mini version of the top pick in our guide to air purifiers. It has a three-stage filter (pre, activated carbon and particle filters) though that particle filter is not a true HEPA filter. But it’s rated at 250 square feet and can help clear the air in your office or other small room. 8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth controller (Switch 2) for $43 ($27 off with Prime): If you’ve got a Switch 2 and are looking for a good controller to go with it, we think this is a good one. Recommended in our guide to the best Switch 2 accessories, it’s got an Xbox style configuration with the left stick placed higher on the game pad, which some prefer. The lowest price we tracked before this is $50. Anker 555 USB-C Hub for $36 ($14 off with Prime): To give your iPad (or even your laptop) more connection options, pick up this USB-C hub. It’s the model we liked best for our guide to MacBook accessories and adds an HDMI port, an SD card reader, Ethernet jack and two USB-A ports. It also has one data USB-C port and a pass through power delivery USB-C port, along with a built-in USB-C cable. Echo Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year. Elden Ring (PS5) for $30 ($20 off): If you somehow haven’t yet played the action-RPG Elden Ring, here’s a chance to do so for less money. It’s challenging yet accessible if you want plus it’s darkly funny and one of our favorite games. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5) for $35 ($15 off): We gave this game a favorable review last year. But just note that you’ll get more out of it if you’ve played Final Fantasy 7 Remake. —> For more video game deals, check out Engadget's gaming deals roundup. Belkin Carrying Case for Nintendo Switch 2 for $25 ($5 off with Prime): While this model doesn’t have the battery pack like Belkin’s charging case that we reviewed, it will still offer more than enough protection for everyday bumps and tumbles just like its more expensive counterpart. Belkin Apple AirTag holder for $15 ($5 off with Prime): The best thing about Apple’s AirTags are their ability to rope in most any nearby iPhone to anonymously hunt for lost trackers. The worst thing is probably the tiny, slippery disk shape that can’t attach to anything without some help. This is the help we suggest in our iPhone accessories guide. Ultimate Ears Wonderboom Play speaker for $48 ($42 off with Prime): This is a relative of the Wonderboom 4, one of our favorite Bluetooth speakers. It only has one driver and passive radiator, while the Wonderboom 4 has two of each. The battery life isn’t quite as long here, either (10 hours compared to 14). But this one is currently half the price of its sibling. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): We named this thumbdrive one of the best SSDs you can buy. This configuration has 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS with this device. The best thing about Roku streaming sticks is the access to all the free content — so this is an affordable way to get it. Belkin 45W Dual USB C Charger Block for $29 ($11 off with Prime): Members of my family fight over this handy wall charger. It has exactly what you need, two USB-C ports and speedy, 45W charging, perfect for juicing up a phone and tablet in tandem. Leebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $38 ($32 off with Prime): This is an updated version of the electric scrubber we love that makes shower cleaning easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C. Blink Outdoor 4 security camera for $35 ($45 off): We named this the best choice for Alexa users in our guide to security cameras. It works seamlessly with Alexa devices like the Echo speakers and Show displays. Plus it can run for up to two years on a set of AA batteries and we found the motion detection to be spot on. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $23 ($12 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. Anker Soundcore 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker for $28 ($17 off with Prime): This small speaker was a past pick in our guide to the best Bluetooth speakers. It’s waterproof and goes for 24 hours on a charge. We found the sound to be surprisingly big for its size. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design and improved speakers. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. It went as low as $45 for Black Friday last year. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam $40 ($20 off): If you like the idea of being able to move the camera around to follow the action in your home, you may want to get a pan-and-tilt option like this one. We will again note that new Ring devices are on the way, but if you don’t have to have the latest thing and just want to see what your dog gets up to while you’re gone, you may want to snag this 33 percent discount. Anker Soundcore Space A40 for $43 ($37 off with Prime): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity. JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 ($12 off with Prime): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-include-sales-from-anker-ring-lego-roku-and-others-120531317.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "It’s time for another October Prime Day sale, and that means Amazon is selling a number of well-regarded TVs for lower prices than usual. Not every deal is exclusive to the event, and it’s still possible that these sets drop even further as we get closer to Black Friday. But for now, a number of highly-rated sets from LG, Samsung, Sony and other brands are at or near their lowest prices to date. We’ve rounded up all the best October Prime Day TV deals we’ve seen thus far below, along with a few discounts on streaming players we like. Just note that you may need to be an Prime subscriber to access some of the discounts in Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days event, which runs through October 8. Best Prime Day TV deals TCL QM7K 55-inch Mini-LED TV for $570 ($330 off MSRP): If you’re willing to stretch your budget a little further, the TCL QM7K is a fairly comprehensive step up, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz support at 1080p, too, though it’s still limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. (As with the QM6K, however, neither of those is an eARC port, so hooking up a soundbar won’t block a game console if you have multiple systems.) This discount represents a new low, beating the previous best mark we've seen by roughly $30. Hisense U8QG 65-inch Mini-LED TV for $998 ($500 off): Several reviews suggest that the Hisense U8QG ticks most of the requisite boxes for a LCD TV in 2025: robust local dimming and mini-LED backlighting, exceptionally high brightness, vibrant quantum-dot colors, a fast refresh rate (165Hz in this case), support for the major HDR formats and so on. It’s a higher-end option than something like the TCL QM6K or QM7K with superior brightness and contrast, though it still falls short of a good OLED TV when it comes to the latter. Like most LCD panels, it’ll also look a bit washed out if you view it from an angle. It has three HDMI 2.1 ports, which is one fewer than many other TVs in this price range, though it uniquely includes a USB-C video input if you want to hook up a gaming laptop or Nintendo Switch. (Just note that you won’t get VRR or HDR when using that.) You’d mainly get it over an OLED TV if you’re willing to trade some picture quality for something better-suited in a bright room. This deal on the 65-inch model matches the best price we've tracked. Samsung S90F 55-inch QD-OLED TV for $1,100 ($498 off): The Samsung S90F is an upper-tier model with a QD-OLED panel, which blends the usual perks of a quality OLED set — near-perfect contrast, wide viewing angles, clear motion, low input lag — with a layer of quantum dots. This helps it produce a wider gamut of more vivid colors compared to traditional WOLED TVs. It also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports and has a fast refresh rate of 144Hz. It doesn’t support Dolby Vision HDR, however, and reviews we trust say that the LG C5, a competing WOLED model, retains darker black levels in a bright room. This deal marks a new low for the 55-inch model, while the 65-inch and 77-inch versions are also at all-time lows of $1,598 and $2,298, respectively. Just make sure you only buy the 55-, 65- or 77-inch model, as every other size in the US uses a lesser WOLED panel. Shady, we know. LG C5 65-inch OLED TV for $1,378 ($1,319 off): The LG C5 can’t produce the same bold colors as a QD-OLED display like the Samsung S90F, but reviews almost universally agree that it’s an exceptional OLED TV otherwise. It should get brighter with non-HDR content, and as noted above it should produce deeper blacks in well-lit environments. It also has just about all the essential gaming features, plus it supports the popular Dolby Vision HDR format (but not HDR10+). If you need that, or if you want an OLED set in this price range for a bright-ish room, it’s well worth a look. This is nearly an all-time low for the 65-inch model, beating its typical street price by about $125. Other sizes are also on sale, but note that the 42- and 48-inch models can’t get as bright as the larger versions. LG B5 55-inch OLED TV for $997 ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025, and as such it’s a level below the C5 in terms of brightness and color performance. It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz as well, though that isn’t a huge deal right now unless you plan on hooking up a gaming PC. If anything, last year’s LG C4 — which isn’t seriously discounted as of this writing — is a better value for most on the whole. But if you just want to save cash, the B5 still provides most of the core benefits of an OLED display at a lower price. This is a new all-time low for the 55-inch variant. Samsung S95F 55-inch QD-OLED TV for $1,998 ($200 off): If you’re willing to pay for a top-of-the-line OLED TV, the Samsung S95F should fit the bill. Reviews around the web praise it for being especially bright for an OLED TV while retaining the bold colors and superb contrast you’d want from a high-end QD-OLED panel. That brightness combined with the screen’s matte finish means it’s particularly adept at fending off glare, so it’ll be effective in either a dark or bright room. It’s also loaded with gaming features, including a 165Hz refresh rate. That said, the matte coating means black levels won’t be as deep in a well-lit environment, and there’s still no Dolby Vision support. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model. LG G5 55-inch OLED TV for $1,747 ($753 off): The LG G5 competes with the Samsung S95F in the top end of the OLED TV market. Most reviews say it can get even brighter than Samsung’s model, it supports Dolby Vision and its lack of a matte coating means it won’t lose its inky black levels in a bright room. That said, having a glossy finish also means that it’s more susceptible to direct reflections. And while its picture is a level above most other WOLED TVs, it isn’t quite on par with the S95F when it comes to color volume. Still, if you’re mainly going to watch things in the dark, it might be the better buy. This is a new low for the 55-inch variant. Sony Bravia 8 II 65-inch QD-OLED TV for $2,798 ($702 off): It’s certainly not cheap, but the Sony Bravia 8 II has earned plaudits for its excellent image processing, upscaling and overall accuracy alongside the expected color, contrast and motion benefits of its QD-OLED display. This should help it make lots of movies and shows look closer to their original intent. It also uses the handy Google TV interface. This deal marks the best price to date for the 65-inch version. That said, if you can’t stomach the high price, other reviews note that the older Sony A95L offers similar performance a bit less, while more recent competitors like the LG G5 and Samsung S95F can get noticeably brighter (even if they’re not always as accurate). Those two should be better for gaming as well, as the Bravia 8 II only has two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher. Samsung The Frame (2024) 55-inch LED TV for $798 ($700 off): Samsung’s The Frame series has always been for people who care about their TV’s aesthetic more than its picture quality, since it’s designed to resemble a framed piece of wall art. It’s still overpriced for a TV with no local dimming or Dolby Vision HDR, but this deal ties the lowest price we’ve seen for the 55-inch model, making it at least a little more reasonable. Other sizes are also on sale. Note that this deal is for the 2024 model — this year’s version is discounted as well, but its panel still isn’t great for the price. We’d recommend saving as much cash as possible if you really want one of these things. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $30 ($20 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you prefer a stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you’re partial to Roku’s app-centric interface, which many find simpler to navigate than the content-heavy UIs pushed by Google and Amazon. It supports Apple AirPlay and the major HDR formats, and its performance remains quick enough for most. You’ll have to deal with some ads, though, and no Roku player supports the Twitch app. This deal is $5 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in several years. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $24 ($16 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is cheaper alternative to the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender built in. The latter means it may be less reliable if you don’t get a consistent connection in your TV’s room. (Both sticks are limited to Wi-Fi 5, though.) That said, this model can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port instead of requiring a separate power supply. If you can live with the sacrifices, it may not be worth paying extra. This deal represents a new all-time low. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off): The standard Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it comes with a slightly slower processor, half the storage (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people just looking for a casual streamer on the cheap, those shouldn’t be huge losses. This model is also more powerful than the just-announced Fire TV 4K Select, though its Fire OS interface can still be messy and ad-heavy, with special emphasis on Amazon’s own services. This deal is $3 more than the stick’s all-time low, though it matches the best price we’ve seen since Black Friday last year. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It can only stream up to 1080p, and it can run a bit choppier than the 4K models since it has a slower chipset and half the RAM (1GB). The usual issues with the Fire TV interface still apply here too. But if you just want to add streaming apps to an aging TV or basic monitor for as little cash as possible, it should get the job done. This discount ties the device's lowest price to date.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/prime-day-tv-deals-save-up-to-500-on-sets-from-samsung-lg-sony-and-more-180051945.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Camera buyers usually mark Amazon's October Prime Day on their calendars as it's a great way to get a nice discount on a major purchase — especially since recent tariffs have caused price increases with some brands. This year's sale looks like a good one, with genuine value available on camera equipment, drone and accessory purchases. Some key deals include discounts on DJI drones, action cams and wireless mics, along with sales on cameras from Sony, Canon, Insta360, GoPro and Nikon. Many of those cameras are ranked highly in our most recent camera guide, like Nikon's Z6 III and the Panasonic S5 IIx — so feel free to check that out as you add items to your cart. Without further delay, here are the best Prime Day camera deals you can grab this week. Best Prime Day camera deals DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but it has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots.

Another nice feature is 47GB of internal storage, something its main rivals lack. And the Osmo Action 5 Pro works directly with DJI’s noise-cancelling Mic 2 and Mic Mini wireless microphones, providing an easy way to record high-quality sound.

Other specs remain the same, including up to 5.3K at 60fps in 10-bit color, along with the excellent Hypersmooth stabilization. And if you want an even wider field of view, grab the Hero 13 Black Wide Edition for $329. DJI Osmo 360 action cam for $413 (25 percent off): It took DJI awhile to get a panoramic action cam into the market, but the Osmo 360 was worth the wait.

It’s also easy to use, offers good battery life and trumps its competition with a large amount of built-in storage. Insta360 X5 action camera for $500 (9 percent off): The X5 has a larger 1/1.28-inch sensor compared to the X4's 1/2-inch sensor, ensuring more detail and a notable boost to low-light performance.

Panasonic Lumix S9 for $1,198 (20 percent off): The S9 may be Panasonic's smallest full-frame camera but it comes with the same 24MP sensor and similar video features to the popular S5 II. To that end, it offers up to 6.2K video, in-body stabilization and reliable autofocus.

You also get a flip-out screen for vlogging and updated five-axis in-body stabilization that’s the best in the industry. Photo quality is also good thanks to the dual-gain 24-megapixel sensor. The main drawback is the slowish burst speeds. Sony A7 IV for $2,198 (19 percent off): Resolution is up considerably from the 24-megapixel A7 III to 33 megapixels, with image quality much improved overall. Video is now up to par with rivals with 4K at up to 60p with 10 bit 4:2:2 quality. Autofocus is incredible for both video and stills, and the in-body stabilization does a good job.

Panasonic S5 IIx with two lenses for $2,298 (22 percent off): The S5 IIx is identical to the S5 II except that it offers high bitrate Apple ProRes capture directly to an external SSD.

All of that makes it ideal for creators and photographers alike, with the only drawback being the reduced resolution. Sony A7R V for $3,798 (10 percent off): With a 61-megapixel sensor, the A7R V shoots sharp and beautiful images at a very respectable speed for such a high-resolution model (10 fps). It has equally fast and reliable autofocus, the sharpest viewfinder on the market and in-body stabilization that’s much improved over the A7R IV. Video has even improved, with 8K and 10-bit options now on tap, albeit with significant rolling shutter Best Prime Day camera lens and accessory deals Osmo Mobile 7 for $75 (16 percent off): One of the best things to elevate your smartphone footage is a gimbal like the Osmo Mobile 7 from DJI. The company makes some of the best drones you can buy, so it knows a thing or two about camera stabilization, so it will make your smarphone videos smooth as silk.

          "standfirst": "Robot vacuums have gone from novelty gadgets to everyday helpers. The best robot vacuum keeps your floors tidy without you needing to drag out a bulky upright or spend time sweeping. Today’s models map your space, avoid obstacles and even empty themselves, making them a solid addition to any home. If you’ve got pets, kids or just a busy schedule, a robot vacuum takes care of the little messes that build up fast.Not every option costs a fortune either. While high-end models pack in powerful suction and advanced navigation, the best budget robot vacuums still do a great job with everyday cleaning. They might skip extras like self-emptying docks, but they’ll keep dust and crumbs from piling up without much effort from you.In this guide, we’ve tested and compared the top models so you don’t have to. From premium devices packed with smart features to affordable picks that get the basics right, we’ll help you find the best robot vacuum for your needs and budget. Table of contents Best robot vacuums 2025 What to look for in a robot vacuum Robot vacuum maintenance tips How we test robot vacuums Robot vacuum FAQs Best robot vacuums 2025 What to look for in the best robot vacuums Floor type We recommend thinking first about the floors in your home: Do you have carpet throughout, or tile and hardwood floors, or a mix? Robots with stronger suction power will do a better job picking up dirt on carpets as they can get into the nooks and crannies more easily. Some machines have “max” modes as well, which ups suction power but also typically eats battery life faster than the “normal” floor cleaning mode. Vacuum suction Suction power is an important factor to consider. Unfortunately, there isn’t a standard power scale that all robo-vacs adhere to, so it’s difficult to compare among a bunch of devices. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger the vacuum cleaner will be. But other companies don’t rely on Pa and simply say their robots have X-times more suction than other robots. If you’re looking for the best vacuum for your needs, it’s helpful to pay attention to real-world testing and how well the vac can pick up fine dust, crumbs and pet hair in an environment similar to that of your home. Wi-Fi connectivity As we explained in our budget guide, Wi-Fi connectivity is a key feature for most robot vacuums. Some of the affordable devices aren’t Wi-Fi connected, though, so it’s best to double check before you buy cheap. Wi-Fi lets a robot vacuum cleaner do things like communicate with a mobile app, which then allows you to control the device from your phone. Mapping features and object detection Past a certain price threshold, you’ll find advanced perks like home mapping features, improved object detection and automatic dustbin disposal. Home mapping is exactly what it sounds like: The vacuum uses sensors to map your home’s layout as it cleans, allowing you to send it to particular rooms or avoid no-go zones where you don’t want it to roam. Most robo-vacs have object detection, but some will be better than others at actually avoiding things like chair legs and children’s toys. High-end models even go so far as to promise obstacle avoidance to steer clear of things like pet poop that can potentially ruin your machine. Self-empty station Finally, for peak convenience, consider a self-empty robot vacuum that comes with a self-empty station. These are basically garbage bins attached to the machine’s docking station. At the end of each job, the robo-vac automatically empties its small dustbin into the large clean base – that means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself and you’ll only have to tend to the base once every few weeks. Just keep in mind that most self-emptying bins require proprietary garbage bags – another long-term expense you’ll have to factor in. Also, any vac-and-mop robot with a water tank will not dump its dirty water into the clean base, so you’ll still have to clean up that yourself. Robot vacuums with mopping capabilities Mopping capabilities are much more common now in robot vacuums than they were just five years ago. Machines with this feature have a water tank either built into the robot’s chassis, the auto-empty bin or as a separate piece that you swap in for the dustbin when you want to mop your floors. It makes the robo-vac more useful if you have hard floors in your home that you like to keep squeaky clean, but it does require more work on your part. Filling and emptying the reservoir remains a human’s job for the most part (except on the most expensive machines), as does adding cleaning solutions if the mopping robot comes with this feature to ensure it uses clean water for every cycle. Robot vacuum maintenance tips First and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum’s dustbin after every cleaning job. If you have a model with a self-emptying base, there’s less work for you to do yourself. If not, simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning. It’s also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to its insides. In addition, you’ll want to regularly examine the machine’s brush roll to see if any hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it’s a good idea to check your robot’s brushes regardless — both their main brush and any smaller roller brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangled hair or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards. Robot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine’s user manual or the manufacturer’s website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like Amazon or Walmart. How we test robot vacuums We primarily test robot vacuums by using them as they are intended to be used: in a home, across different types of flooring and in the face of all sorts of messes including pet hair, spilt coffee grounds and other food debris, dust bunnies and more. We set up all robot vacuums according to their provided instructions and run multiple cleaning jobs during a testing period of at least one to two weeks per machine. If the robot has mopping capabilities, we also test those as well on hardwood and tile flooring. For models with self-emptying bases, we rely on those built-in trash cans for all post-job cleaning, and we make sure to test the robot vacuum's mobile app for usability and convenience. As we're testing, we make note of things like how loud the robot and its components are, how much human attention the robot needs on a regular basis, how the robot handles large messes and big dust bunnies, if the robot gets stuck on rugs, doormats or other furniture and more. Robot vacuum FAQs Are robot vacuums worth it? We tackled this question when we reviewed budget robot vacuums and the answer is yes, especially if vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores. Robots take the hard work out of cleaning your floors – just turn the thing on and watch it go. Any robot vacuum cleaner worth buying is semi-autonomous in that it will suck up dirt around your home until its battery is low and then make its way back to its charging dock. Unlike a regular vacuum, you should only have to interact with it to turn it on, empty its dustbin and untangle it if it were to get stuck somewhere. That’s not to say robot vacuums are perfect. They’re almost always less powerful and less flexible than traditional vacuums. Since most robo-vacs are much smaller than traditional models, they often don’t have the same level of suction you’ll get in an upright machine. Plus, their dustbins are smaller, so they will need to be emptied more frequently. While Wi-Fi-connected robot vacuums give you the flexibility to start a cleaning job from anywhere using an app, targeting a small area of your home can be more complicated. Some robo-vacs have spot-cleaning features that focus the machine’s attention on a specific area, which almost – but not quite – mimics the spot-cleaning you’d be able to do yourself with a regular or cordless vacuum. How long do robot vacuums last? Robot vacuums can last many years, if you take care of them properly. Check out our recommendations for robot vacuum maintenance above, but in a nutshell, you should make sure that you're emptying the machine's bin after every job and periodically cleaning the interior of the bin and the brushes. It's also a good idea to check the user manual to see how often your robot vacuum's filter needs changing. Do robot vacuums work better than handheld vacuums? There's no straight answer to this question. Robot vacuums offer more convenience than handheld vacuums, so for those who are looking to automate a chore, that could mean one of these devices works better for them than a standard vacuum. However, handheld vacuum cleaners often have stronger suction power, and they give the user a bit more control. It ultimately depends on how you intend to use your main vacuum cleaner and what you want to prioritize most. How often do you have to clean a robot vacuum? Cleaning a robot vacuum isn’t too much of a chore, but you’ll want to give it a little TLC every few weeks or so, depending on how often you’re running it and how much dirt it’s picking up. The dustbin usually needs to be emptied after each cleaning run, especially if you have pets or lots of carpet where dirt can hide. Many newer models have self-emptying docks, which means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself after every use, but the main bin will still need a good clean once a month or so. Also, it’s a good idea to check the side brushes and main brush for any hair tangles or debris every couple of weeks to keep things running smoothly. What are the negatives of robot vacuums? Robot vacuums won’t work for everyone. One of the biggest drawbacks is that they usually don’t have the same suction power as a full-sized upright vacuum or even a cordless stick vacuum, so they might struggle with deep-cleaning thick carpets. They’re also designed for floors only, so if you’re looking to clean furniture, stairs or other tricky spots, you’ll still need a traditional vacuum to do that. Plus, they can sometimes get stuck or miss spots, especially if you’ve got a lot of furniture or obstacles in the way. While their sensors help, they might still bump into things or need a little help getting out of tight spots. And while most have decent dirt detection features, they’re best for keeping things tidy rather than doing heavy-duty cleaning.

It ultimately depends on how you intend to use your main vacuum cleaner and what you want to prioritize most. How often do you have to clean a robot vacuum? Cleaning a robot vacuum isn’t too much of a chore, but you’ll want to give it a little TLC every few weeks or so, depending on how often you’re running it and how much dirt it’s picking up. The dustbin usually needs to be emptied after each cleaning run, especially if you have pets or lots of carpet where dirt can hide. Many newer models have self-emptying docks, which means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself after every use, but the main bin will still need a good clean once a month or so. Also, it’s a good idea to check the side brushes and main brush for any hair tangles or debris every couple of weeks to keep things running smoothly. What are the negatives of robot vacuums? Robot vacuums won’t work for everyone. One of the biggest drawbacks is that they usually don’t have the same suction power as a full-sized upright vacuum or even a cordless stick vacuum, so they might struggle with deep-cleaning thick carpets. They’re also designed for floors only, so if you’re looking to clean furniture, stairs or other tricky spots, you’ll still need a traditional vacuum to do that. Plus, they can sometimes get stuck or miss spots, especially if you’ve got a lot of furniture or obstacles in the way. While their sensors help, they might still bump into things or need a little help getting out of tight spots. And while most have decent dirt detection features, they’re best for keeping things tidy rather than doing heavy-duty cleaning.

          "standfirst": "Believe it or not, October Prime Day is actually a good time to save on Dyson devices. Plenty of cordless vacuums are on sale this year, as well as a few viral hair stylers. But, none of those top my trusty AM09. Dyson’s Hot+Cool AM09 heater and fan is on sale for $300 right now — that’s 40 percent off and one of the best prices I’ve seen. My love for the AM09 is well documented. At this point, I’ve had it for more than five years and I bought it when it was $280 on super-sale at QVC. Previously, I had a Dyson tower fan that worked well until it kicked the bucket after a few years of use. I took the plunge with the AM09 because I generally had a great experience with the tower fan, and at the time, I had been living in apartments that were consistently chilly during wintertime and downright stifling during the summer months. Now, my house is not all that much different than my apartments of yesteryear — and my original AM09 is still kicking. It does a great job circulating air in the summer (it’s not an air conditioner, to be clear) and it cuts the chill in my particularly icy office during the winter. I love its handy fan, which attaches magnetically to the top of the fan so you don’t lose it and lets you control the fan speed and heater temperature with just a few presses of a button. But the real kicker with the AM09 is how lightweight it is: at just under six pounds, it’s incredibly easy to pick up and tote upstairs, downstairs or in the other room, wherever you need it the most. It has literally gone from my home office upstairs down to the main floor of my house and down again into our basement all in the same day for different purposes. Am I a little miffed that, in my impatience, I bought a discounted Dyson heater/fan/air purifier over the summer because I desperately wanted another AM09 and it wasn’t on sale at the time? Yes — but at least you, dear reader, can learn from my shopping woes and get the AM09 instead.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/my-beloved-dyson-am09-heater-and-fan-is-40-percent-off-for-prime-day-223428328.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "In a packed hall at Fort Mason Center in San Francisco, against a backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman laid out a bold vision to remake the digital world. The company that brought generative AI to the mainstream with a simple chatbot is now building the foundations for its next act: a comprehensive computing platform designed to move beyond the screen and browser, with legendary designer Jony Ive enlisted to help shape its physical form.At its third annual DevDay, OpenAI unveiled a suite of tools that signals a strategic pivot from a model provider to a full-fledged ecosystem. The message was clear: the era of simply asking an AI questions is over. The future is about commanding AI to perform complex tasks, build software autonomously, and live inside every application, a transition Altman framed as moving from \"systems that you can ask anything to, to systems that you can ask to do anything for you.\" The day’s announcements were a three-pronged assault on the status quo, targeting how users interact with software, how developers build it, and how businesses deploy intelligent agents. But it was the sessions held behind closed doors, away from the public livestream, that revealed the true scope of OpenAI’s ambition — a future that includes new hardware, a relentless pursuit of computational power, and a philosophical quest to redefine our relationship with technology.From chatbot to operating system: The new &#x27;App Store&#x27;The centerpiece of the public-facing keynote was the transformation of ChatGPT itself. With the new Apps SDK, OpenAI is turning its wildly popular chatbot into a dynamic, interactive platform, effectively an operating system where developers can build and distribute their own applications.“Today, we&#x27;re going to open up ChatGPT for developers to build real apps inside of ChatGPT,” Altman announced during the keynote presentation to applause. “This will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive and personalized, that you can chat with.”Live demonstrations showcased apps from partners like Coursera, Canva, and Zillow running seamlessly within a chat conversation. A user could watch a machine learning lecture, ask ChatGPT to explain a concept in real-time, and then use Canva to generate a poster based on the conversation, all without leaving the chat interface. The apps can render rich, interactive UIs, even going full-screen to offer a complete experience, like exploring a Zillow map of homes.For developers, this represents a powerful new distribution channel. “When you build with the Apps SDK, your apps can reach hundreds of millions of chat users,” Altman said, highlighting a direct path to a massive user base that has grown to over 800 million weekly active users. In a private press conference later, Nick Turley, head of ChatGPT, elaborated on the grander vision. \"We never meant to build a chatbot,\" he stated. \"When we set out to make ChatGPT, we meant to build a super assistant and we got a little sidetracked. And one of the tragedies of getting a little sidetracked is that we built a great chatbot, but we are the first ones to say that not all software needs to be a chatbot, not all interaction with the commercial world needs to be a chatbot.\"Turley emphasized that while OpenAI is excited about natural language interfaces, \"the interface really needs to evolve, which is why you see so much UI in the demos today. In fact, you can even go full screen and chat is in the background.\" He described a future where users might \"start your day in ChatGPT, just because it kind of has become the de facto entry point into the commercial web and into a lot of software,\" but clarified that \"our incentive is not to keep you in. Our product is to allow other people to build amazing businesses on top and to evolve the form factor of software.\"The rise of the agents: Building the &#x27;do anything&#x27; AIIf apps are about bringing the world into ChatGPT, the new \"Agent Kit\" is about sending AI out into the world to get things done. OpenAI is providing a complete \"set of building blocks... to help you take agents from prototype to production,\" Altman explained in his keynote. Agent Kit is an integrated development environment for creating autonomous AI workers. It features a visual canvas to design complex workflows, an embeddable chat interface (\"Chat Kit\") for deploying agents in any app, and a sophisticated evaluation suite to measure and improve performance.A compelling demo from financial operations platform Ramp showed how Agent Kit was used to build a procurement agent. An employee could simply type, \"I need five more ChatGPT business seats,\" and the agent would parse the request, check it against company expense policies, find vendor details, and prepare a virtual credit card for the purchase — a process that once took weeks now completed in minutes. This push into agents is a direct response to a growing enterprise need to move beyond AI as a simple information retrieval tool and toward AI as a productivity engine that automates complex business processes. Brad Lightcap, OpenAI&#x27;s COO, noted that for enterprise adoption, \"you needed this kind of shift to more agentic AI that could actually do things for you, versus just respond with text outputs.\" The future of code and the Jony Ive bBombshellPerhaps the most profound shift is occurring in software development itself. Codex, OpenAI&#x27;s AI coding agent, has graduated from a research preview to a full-fledged product, now powered by a specialized version of the new GPT-5 model. It is, as one speaker put it, \"a teammate that understands your context.\" The capabilities are staggering. Developers can now assign Codex tasks directly from Slack, and the agent can autonomously write code, create pull requests, and even review other engineers&#x27; work on GitHub. A live demo showed Codex taking a simple photo of a whiteboard sketch and turning it into a fully functional, beautifully designed mobile app screen. Another demo showed an app that could \"self-evolve,\" reprogramming itself in real-time based on a user&#x27;s natural language request. But the day&#x27;s biggest surprise came in a closing fireside chat, which was not livestreamed, between Altman and Jony Ive, the iconic former chief design officer of Apple. The two revealed they have been collaborating for three years on a new family of AI-centric hardware.Ive, whose design philosophy shaped the iPhone, iMac, and Apple Watch, said his creative team’s purpose \"became clear\" with the launch of ChatGPT. He argued that our current relationship with technology is broken and that AI presents an opportunity for a fundamental reset.“I think it would be absurd to assume that you could have technology that is this breathtaking, delivered to us through legacy products, products that are decades old,” Ive said. “I see it as a chance to use this most remarkable capability to full-on address a lot of the overwhelm and despair that people feel right now.”While details of the devices remain secret, Ive spoke of his motivation in deeply human terms. “We love our species, and we want to be useful. We think that humanity deserves much better than humanity generally is given,” he said. He emphasized the importance of \"care\" in the design process, stating, \"We sense when people have cared... you sense carelessness. You sense when somebody does not care about you, they care about money and schedule.\" This collaboration confirms that OpenAI&#x27;s ambitions are not confined to the cloud; it is actively exploring the physical interface through which humanity will interact with its powerful new intelligence.The Unquenchable Thirst for ComputeUnderpinning this entire platform strategy is a single, overwhelming constraint: the availability of computing power. In both the private press conference and the un-streamed Developer State of the Union, OpenAI’s leadership returned to this theme again and again.“The degree to which we are all constrained by compute... Everyone is just so constrained on being able to offer the services at the scale required to get the revenue that at this point, we&#x27;re quite confident we can push it pretty far,” Altman told reporters. He added that even with massive new hardware partnerships with AMD and others, \"we&#x27;ll be saying the same thing again. We&#x27;re so convinced... There&#x27;s so much more demand.\" This explains the company’s aggressive, multi-billion-dollar investment in infrastructure. When asked about profitability, Altman was candid that the company is in a phase of \"investment and growth.\" He invoked a famous quote from Walt Disney, paraphrasing, \"We make more money so we can make more movies.\" For OpenAI, the \"movies\" are ever-more-powerful AI models.Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s President, put the ultimate goal in stark economic terms during the Developer State of the Union. \"AI is going to become, probably in the not too distant future, the fundamental driver of economic growth,\" he said. \"Asking ‘How much compute do you want?’ is a little bit like asking how much workforce do you want? The answer is, you can always get more out of more.\" As the day concluded and developers mingled at the reception, the scale of OpenAI&#x27;s project came into focus. Fueled by new models like the powerful GPT-5 Pro and the stunning Sora 2 video generator, the company is no longer just building AI. It is building the world where AI will live — a world of intelligent apps, autonomous agents, and new physical devices, betting that in the near future, intelligence itself will be the ultimate platform.",

          "title": "Google's AI can now surf the web for you, click on buttons, and fill out forms with Gemini 2.5 Computer Use",
          "standfirst": "Some of the largest providers of large language models (LLMs) have sought to move beyond multimodal chatbots — extending their models out into \"agents\" that can actually take more actions on behalf of the user across websites. Recall OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT Agent (formerly known as \"Operator\") and Anthropic&#x27;s Computer Use, both released over the last two years. Now, Google is getting into that same game as well. Today, the search giant&#x27;s DeepMind AI lab subsidiary unveiled a new, fine-tuned and custom-trained version of its powerful Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM known as \"Gemini 2.5 Pro Computer Use,\" which can use a virtual browser to surf the web on your behalf, retrieve information, fill out forms, and even take actions on websites — all from a user&#x27;s single text prompt.\"These are early days, but the model’s ability to interact with the web – like scrolling, filling forms + navigating dropdowns – is an important next step in building general-purpose agents,\" said Google CEO Sundar Pichai, as part of a longer statement on the social network, X.The model is not available for consumers directly from Google, though.Instead, Google partnered with another company, Browserbase, founded by former Twilio engineer Paul Klein in early 2024, which offers virtual \"headless\" web browser specifically for use by AI agents and applications. (A \"headless\" browser is one that doesn&#x27;t require a graphical user interface, or GUI, to navigate the web, though in this case and others, Browserbase does show a graphical representation for the user). Users can demo the new Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model directly on Browserbase here and even compare it side-by-side with the older, rival offerings from OpenAI and Anthropic in a new \"Browser Arena\" launched by the startup (though only one additional model can be selected alongside Gemini at a time).For AI builders and developers, it&#x27;s being made as a raw, albeit propreitary LLM through the Gemini API in Google AI Studio for rapid prototyping, and Google Cloud&#x27;s Vertex AI model selector and applications building platform. The new offering builds on the capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro, released back in March 2025 but which has been updated significantly several times since then, with a specific focus on enabling AI agents to perform direct interactions with user interfaces, including browsers and mobile applications.Overall, it appears Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is designed to let developers create agents that can complete interface-driven tasks autonomously — such as clicking, typing, scrolling, filling out forms, and navigating behind login screens. Rather than relying solely on APIs or structured inputs, this model allows AI systems to interact with software visually and functionally, much like a human would.Brief User Hands-On TestsIn my brief, unscientific initial hands-on tests on the Browserbase website, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use successfully navigate to Taylor Swift&#x27;s official website as instructed and provided me a summary of what was being sold or promoted at the top — a special edition of her newest album, \"The Life of A Showgirl.\"In another test, I asked Gemini 2.5 Computer Use to search Amazon for highly rated and well-reviewed solar lights I could stake into my back yard, and I was delighted to watch as it successfully completed a Google Search Captcha designed to weed out non-human users (\"Select all the boxes with a motorcycle.\") It did so in a matter of seconds.However, once it got through there, it stalled and was unable to complete the task, despite serving up a \"task competed\" message. I should also note here that while the ChatGPT agent from OpenAI and Anthropic&#x27;s Claude can create and edit local files — such as PowerPoint presentations, spreadsheets, or text documents — on the user’s behalf, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use does not currently offer direct file system access or native file creation capabilities. Instead, it is designed to control and navigate web and mobile user interfaces through actions like clicking, typing, and scrolling. Its output is limited to suggested UI actions or chatbot-style text responses; any structured output like a document or file must be handled separately by the developer, often through custom code or third-party integrations.Performance BenchmarksGoogle says Gemini 2.5 Computer Use has demonstrated leading results in multiple interface control benchmarks, particularly when compared to other major AI systems including Claude Sonnet and OpenAI’s agent-based models. Evaluations were conducted via Browserbase and Google’s own testing.Some highlights include:Online-Mind2Web (Browserbase): 65.7% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 61.0% (Claude Sonnet 4) and 44.3% (OpenAI Agent)WebVoyager (Browserbase): 79.9% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 69.4% (Claude Sonnet 4) and 61.0% (OpenAI Agent)AndroidWorld (DeepMind): 69.7% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 62.1% (Claude Sonnet 4); OpenAI&#x27;s model could not be measured due to lack of accessOSWorld: Currently not supported by Gemini 2.5; top competitor result was 61.4%In addition to strong accuracy, Google reports that the model operates at lower latency than other browser control solutions — a key factor in production use cases like UI automation and testing.How It WorksAgents powered by the Computer Use model operate within an interaction loop. They receive:A user task promptA screenshot of the interfaceA history of past actionsThe model analyzes this input and produces a recommended UI action, such as clicking a button or typing into a field. If needed, it can request confirmation from the end user for riskier tasks, such as making a purchase.Once the action is executed, the interface state is updated and a new screenshot is sent back to the model. The loop continues until the task is completed or halted due to an error or a safety decision.The model uses a specialized tool called computer_use, and it can be integrated into custom environments using tools like Playwright or via the Browserbase demo sandbox.Use Cases and AdoptionAccording to Google, teams internally and externally have already started using the model across several domains:Google’s payments platform team reports that Gemini 2.5 Computer Use successfully recovers over 60% of failed test executions, reducing a major source of engineering inefficiencies.Autotab, a third-party AI agent platform, said the model outperformed others on complex data parsing tasks, boosting performance by up to 18% in their hardest evaluations.Poke.com, a proactive AI assistant provider, noted that the Gemini model often operates 50% faster than competing solutions during interface interactions.The model is also being used in Google’s own product development efforts, including in Project Mariner, the Firebase Testing Agent, and AI Mode in Search.Safety MeasuresBecause this model directly controls software interfaces, Google emphasizes a multi-layered approach to safety:A per-step safety service inspects every proposed action before execution.Developers can define system-level instructions to block or require confirmation for specific actions.The model includes built-in safeguards to avoid actions that might compromise security or violate Google’s prohibited use policies.For example, if the model encounters a CAPTCHA, it will generate an action to click the checkbox but flag it as requiring user confirmation, ensuring the system does not proceed without human oversight.Technical CapabilitiesThe model supports a wide array of built-in UI actions such as:click_at, type_text_at, scroll_document, drag_and_drop, and moreUser-defined functions can be added to extend its reach to mobile or custom environmentsScreen coordinates are normalized (0–1000 scale) and translated back to pixel dimensions during executionIt accepts image and text input and outputs text responses or function calls to perform tasks. The recommended screen resolution for optimal results is 1440x900, though it can work with other sizes.API Pricing Remains Almost Identical to Gemini 2.5 ProThe pricing for Gemini 2.5 Computer Use aligns closely with the standard Gemini 2.5 Pro model. Both follow the same per-token billing structure: input tokens are priced at $1.25 per one million tokens for prompts under 200,000 tokens, and $2.50 per million tokens for prompts longer than that. Output tokens follow a similar split, priced at $10.00 per million for smaller responses and $15.00 for larger ones.Where the models diverge is in availability and additional features. Gemini 2.5 Pro includes a free tier that allows developers to use the model at no cost, with no explicit token cap published, though usage may be subject to rate limits or quota constraints depending on the platform (e.g. Google AI Studio). This free access includes both input and output tokens. Once developers exceed their allotted quota or switch to the paid tier, standard per-token pricing applies.In contrast, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is available exclusively through the paid tier. There is no free access currently offered for this model, and all usage incurs token-based charges from the outset.Feature-wise, Gemini 2.5 Pro supports optional capabilities like context caching (starting at $0.31 per million tokens) and grounding with Google Search (free for up to 1,500 requests per day, then $35 per 1,000 additional requests). These are not available for Computer Use at this time.Another distinction is in data handling: output from the Computer Use model is not used to improve Google products in the paid tier, while free-tier usage of Gemini 2.5 Pro contributes to model improvement unless explicitly opted out.Overall, developers can expect similar token-based costs across both models, but they should consider tier access, included capabilities, and data use policies when deciding which model fits their needs.",
          "content": "Some of the largest providers of large language models (LLMs) have sought to move beyond multimodal chatbots — extending their models out into \"agents\" that can actually take more actions on behalf of the user across websites. Recall OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT Agent (formerly known as \"Operator\") and Anthropic&#x27;s Computer Use, both released over the last two years. Now, Google is getting into that same game as well. Today, the search giant&#x27;s DeepMind AI lab subsidiary unveiled a new, fine-tuned and custom-trained version of its powerful Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM known as \"Gemini 2.5 Pro Computer Use,\" which can use a virtual browser to surf the web on your behalf, retrieve information, fill out forms, and even take actions on websites — all from a user&#x27;s single text prompt.\"These are early days, but the model’s ability to interact with the web – like scrolling, filling forms + navigating dropdowns – is an important next step in building general-purpose agents,\" said Google CEO Sundar Pichai, as part of a longer statement on the social network, X.The model is not available for consumers directly from Google, though.Instead, Google partnered with another company, Browserbase, founded by former Twilio engineer Paul Klein in early 2024, which offers virtual \"headless\" web browser specifically for use by AI agents and applications. (A \"headless\" browser is one that doesn&#x27;t require a graphical user interface, or GUI, to navigate the web, though in this case and others, Browserbase does show a graphical representation for the user). Users can demo the new Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model directly on Browserbase here and even compare it side-by-side with the older, rival offerings from OpenAI and Anthropic in a new \"Browser Arena\" launched by the startup (though only one additional model can be selected alongside Gemini at a time).For AI builders and developers, it&#x27;s being made as a raw, albeit propreitary LLM through the Gemini API in Google AI Studio for rapid prototyping, and Google Cloud&#x27;s Vertex AI model selector and applications building platform. The new offering builds on the capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro, released back in March 2025 but which has been updated significantly several times since then, with a specific focus on enabling AI agents to perform direct interactions with user interfaces, including browsers and mobile applications.Overall, it appears Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is designed to let developers create agents that can complete interface-driven tasks autonomously — such as clicking, typing, scrolling, filling out forms, and navigating behind login screens. Rather than relying solely on APIs or structured inputs, this model allows AI systems to interact with software visually and functionally, much like a human would.Brief User Hands-On TestsIn my brief, unscientific initial hands-on tests on the Browserbase website, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use successfully navigate to Taylor Swift&#x27;s official website as instructed and provided me a summary of what was being sold or promoted at the top — a special edition of her newest album, \"The Life of A Showgirl.\"In another test, I asked Gemini 2.5 Computer Use to search Amazon for highly rated and well-reviewed solar lights I could stake into my back yard, and I was delighted to watch as it successfully completed a Google Search Captcha designed to weed out non-human users (\"Select all the boxes with a motorcycle.\") It did so in a matter of seconds.However, once it got through there, it stalled and was unable to complete the task, despite serving up a \"task competed\" message. I should also note here that while the ChatGPT agent from OpenAI and Anthropic&#x27;s Claude can create and edit local files — such as PowerPoint presentations, spreadsheets, or text documents — on the user’s behalf, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use does not currently offer direct file system access or native file creation capabilities. Instead, it is designed to control and navigate web and mobile user interfaces through actions like clicking, typing, and scrolling. Its output is limited to suggested UI actions or chatbot-style text responses; any structured output like a document or file must be handled separately by the developer, often through custom code or third-party integrations.Performance BenchmarksGoogle says Gemini 2.5 Computer Use has demonstrated leading results in multiple interface control benchmarks, particularly when compared to other major AI systems including Claude Sonnet and OpenAI’s agent-based models. Evaluations were conducted via Browserbase and Google’s own testing.Some highlights include:Online-Mind2Web (Browserbase): 65.7% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 61.0% (Claude Sonnet 4) and 44.3% (OpenAI Agent)WebVoyager (Browserbase): 79.9% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 69.4% (Claude Sonnet 4) and 61.0% (OpenAI Agent)AndroidWorld (DeepMind): 69.7% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 62.1% (Claude Sonnet 4); OpenAI&#x27;s model could not be measured due to lack of accessOSWorld: Currently not supported by Gemini 2.5; top competitor result was 61.4%In addition to strong accuracy, Google reports that the model operates at lower latency than other browser control solutions — a key factor in production use cases like UI automation and testing.How It WorksAgents powered by the Computer Use model operate within an interaction loop. They receive:A user task promptA screenshot of the interfaceA history of past actionsThe model analyzes this input and produces a recommended UI action, such as clicking a button or typing into a field. If needed, it can request confirmation from the end user for riskier tasks, such as making a purchase.Once the action is executed, the interface state is updated and a new screenshot is sent back to the model. The loop continues until the task is completed or halted due to an error or a safety decision.The model uses a specialized tool called computer_use, and it can be integrated into custom environments using tools like Playwright or via the Browserbase demo sandbox.Use Cases and AdoptionAccording to Google, teams internally and externally have already started using the model across several domains:Google’s payments platform team reports that Gemini 2.5 Computer Use successfully recovers over 60% of failed test executions, reducing a major source of engineering inefficiencies.Autotab, a third-party AI agent platform, said the model outperformed others on complex data parsing tasks, boosting performance by up to 18% in their hardest evaluations.Poke.com, a proactive AI assistant provider, noted that the Gemini model often operates 50% faster than competing solutions during interface interactions.The model is also being used in Google’s own product development efforts, including in Project Mariner, the Firebase Testing Agent, and AI Mode in Search.Safety MeasuresBecause this model directly controls software interfaces, Google emphasizes a multi-layered approach to safety:A per-step safety service inspects every proposed action before execution.Developers can define system-level instructions to block or require confirmation for specific actions.The model includes built-in safeguards to avoid actions that might compromise security or violate Google’s prohibited use policies.For example, if the model encounters a CAPTCHA, it will generate an action to click the checkbox but flag it as requiring user confirmation, ensuring the system does not proceed without human oversight.Technical CapabilitiesThe model supports a wide array of built-in UI actions such as:click_at, type_text_at, scroll_document, drag_and_drop, and moreUser-defined functions can be added to extend its reach to mobile or custom environmentsScreen coordinates are normalized (0–1000 scale) and translated back to pixel dimensions during executionIt accepts image and text input and outputs text responses or function calls to perform tasks.

          "standfirst": "Sennheiser hasn’t debuted a premium set of wireless headphones since the Momentum 4 arrived in 2022. Sure, there were two sets of Accentum cans, but those offer more mid-range performance in the $180-$250 range. Instead of a Momentum 5 for its latest release, the company has revealed the HDB 630: a $500 set of wireless noise-canceling headphones that offer lossless listening via wired connection. If you’re thinking the HDB 630 looks an awful lot like the Momentum 4, you’re correct. Sennheiser says this new model “inherited” the chassis from those 2022 headphones, but there’s a new acoustic system inside for “focused listening.” That setup includes 42mm dynamic drivers what were “designed for purity, not hype.” As such, the company promises you’ll hear “the vibe that left the mastering studio” thanks to careful attention to the midrange, vocals and overall dynamics. Those drivers are supported by a high-resolution digital audio engine that works for both wired and wireless listening. Via either the USB-C or 3.5mm ports, you can expect to hear tunes in up to 24-bit/96kHz resolution. The HDB 630 also comes with a USB-C transmitter dongle for phones, tablets and other devices so that you can harness higher-quality listening with aptX Adaptive — even if your gadgets don’t support it natively. “With only an estimated 16 percent of smartphone hardware supporting native wireless high-res sound, the included dongle brings this capability to 80 percent of smartphone models in an instant through their USB Type-C port,” Sennheiser explained in a press release. There are several audio features available on the HDB 630 for an “audiophile” experience. First, Sennheiser employs the Crossfade feature from its HE 1 headphones that blends the left and right channels to make it seem like you’re listening to speakers. There’s also a new Parametric Equalizer for more granular EQ control, complete with bandwidth, filter and A/B settings. The company says any settings tweaks are then applied to the HDB 630’s “advanced processing system” so listeners determine the tuning rather than the content or app providing it. Lastly, users will soon have the ability to share presets via QR code. Another item Sennheiser retained from the Momentum 4 is long battery life. Like that model, the HDB 630 will last up to 60 hours with ANC enabled, so you won’t be reaching for a charging cable often. What’s more, a 10-minuted top up will give you seven hours of use. And when it’s time to travel, there’s an airline adapter included in the box. The HDB 630 is available for pre-order starting today for $499.95. Shipping is scheduled to begin October 21 from Sennhesier and other retailers.

Tablets like the iPad Pro, foldables such as the Galaxy Z Fold series and laptops with USB-C charging all benefit from higher wattage and newer standards like USB-C PD and GaN. Some models are compact enough to fit in your pocket, while others have several ports so you can power a laptop, phone and earbuds at the same time.With so many different devices and charging standards, choosing the best fast charger depends on your setup and how you use it. This guide breaks down our top picks to help you find the right match for your gear. Best fast chargers for 2025 What to consider before buying a fast charger Before you start looking at specific chargers, it's critical to determine three things: how many devices do you need to charge, how much power do they require and whether or not you're planning on traveling with any of them. The reason for the first question is simple. If you only need to charge a single device, like an iPhone or Android phone, it's cheaper and usually more space-efficient to get a lower-wattage phone charger with one port instead of two or three. Next, it's critical to figure out how much electricity your gadgets need because it doesn't make sense to buy a power brick that pushes out more juice than your device can actually use. This may sound a bit tricky, but most major manufacturers will list a product's max charging speeds in its tech specs, which is typically denoted by a specific wattage (15W, for example) or a quick-charge rating. Unfortunately, very powerful or large laptops like gaming notebooks can suck a ton of juice (more than 140 watts), which means they may rely on more traditional power adapters with barrel plugs. This may result in them not being compatible with universal chargers. Some of these PCs may also support charging over USB-C, so even if a specific adapter can't deliver its full power draw, it can still send over some energy — but it will do so at a slower rate compared to the laptop's included charger. To get the best performance, using a fast charging cable, such as a USB-C cable, can make a big difference in maintaining consistent power delivery. For frequent travelers, size and weight are often important considerations, because the bigger and heavier a charger is, the more annoying it will be to lug around. You'll also want to think about other factors like support for international plugs, which can be a big help to anyone who regularly visits other countries. If you’re already traveling with power banks or a charging station, choosing a compact GaN charger can help streamline your gear. Finally, you'll want to figure out if your smartphone uses a proprietary charging standard or if it's compatible with the USB Power Delivery spec (USB PD). For example, the OnePlus 13's included SuperVOOC power adapter can send up to 100 watts to the phone. However, if you use a generic USB-PD charger, speeds top out at 45 watts. That’s still pretty quick, but not nearly as fast as OnePlus' brick — and the same applies to devices with super fast charging support. Also, make sure your charging cable and connector are up to spec, as lower-quality accessories can bottleneck your charging speeds. Fast charger FAQs What is GaN? When looking for chargers, you may notice that some are marked as GaN, which stands for gallium nitride. This is an important distinction because, when compared to older adapters that use silicon switches, GaN-based devices support increased power efficiency and output, allowing manufacturers to create more compact bricks that run cooler and support higher wattages. Depending on the specific power output, GaN adapters can be 30 to 50 percent smaller and lighter than silicon-based alternatives. That might not sound like much, but when they’re sitting in a bag alongside a laptop and a half dozen other accessories you might have, cutting down on excess bulk and weight goes a long way. Do fast chargers affect battery life? Technically yes, because the process of sending a ton of watts into a gadget and potentially generating additional heat while doing so can decrease battery health over time. That said, modern devices and chargers use various protocols to ensure temperatures and power levels stay within preset limits — in large part to avoid damaging the product or creating a safety risk. At a base level, simply charging a gadget regardless of speed will cause degradation over time (nothing stays perfect forever, you know?). So as long as you use compatible chargers and cables, the impact of fast charging is generally quite negligible. What's the difference between a fast charger and a regular charger? There isn't a single generally accepted definition of fast charging. However, with power adapters capable of sending as little as five watts or less, it's important to know how much juice your device is getting, especially if you need to recharge something quickly. So depending on who you ask (particularly when it comes to smartphones), any charger that can push out more than 15 to 18 watts is generally considered to be \"fast.\" That said, with some phones capable of receiving more than 100 watts and up to 240 watts for some laptops, it's more important than ever to consider what devices you own before buying a new fast charger.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html?src=rss",

One of the best deals in this space is on Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2, which are down to $170. That's $60 off their usual $230 price, and a pretty great deal for a pair of wireless buds that rival Apple's AirPods Pro 3. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are compact wireless earbuds with a touch-sensitive surface and a small circular ring in the back to help them stay in your ears. You can currently purchase the buds in bluish-gray \"Moonstone,\" off-white \"Porcelain,\" pink \"Peony\" or light black \"Hazel\" color options, but whichever you choose, you'll get solid active noise cancellation and a collection of other helpful audio features. In terms of ANC, Engadget's review of the Pixel Buds Pro 2 found that the earbuds do a good job of blocking out \"low-to-mid-range noise\" but still struggle to block out nearby voices. On the whole, though, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 sounds better than Google's previous wireless earbuds, particularly when you're listening bass-forward tracks. The capabilities of the Pixel Buds Pro 2 extend beyond just listening to music, of course. Like its competitors, Google has turned its wireless earbuds into hearing protection, too. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 were recently updated to support what Google calls Loud Noise Protection, which can reduce incoming loud noises to protect your ears. That's on top of features like Adaptive Audio, which can adjust noise cancellation and volume based on your surroundings, and Talk to Gemini Live, which gives you a hands-free way to have a free-flowing conversation with Google's AI chatbot. There might be other earbuds that offer better audio performance, but the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is the best option if you're on Android and want a seamless experience.

The Galaxy S25 is a mix of old and new. The phone largely looks like the Galaxy S24, but comes in new colors and a slightly thinner frame. It uses the same bright 6.2-inch, 120Hz AMOLED screen, but is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip.

In terms of battery life, the Galaxy S24 already started out strong at around 24 hours, but the Galaxy S25 goes a good bit past that with an additional four hours. That gives you more time for calls or watching videos — one of the tangible benefits of a power-efficient 3nm Qualcomm chip. That performance also shines when it comes with AI. Samsung offers its own collection of Galaxy AI features, like the less-than-useful Now Brief and AI photo editing, but it's also just a good vehicle for Gemini.

          "title": "Has this stealth startup finally cracked the code on enterprise AI agent reliability? Meet AUI's Apollo-1",
          "standfirst": "For more than a decade, conversational AI has promised human-like assistants that can do more than chat. Yet even as large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude learn to reason, explain, and code, one critical category of interaction remains largely unsolved — reliably completing tasks for people outside of chat. Even the best AI models score only in the 30th percentile on Terminal-Bench Hard, a third-party benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of AI agents on completing a variety of browser-based tasks, far below the reliability demanded by most enterprises and users. And task-specific benchmarks like TAU-Bench airline, which measures the reliability of AI agents on finding and booking flights on behalf of a user, also don&#x27;t have much higher pass rates, with only 56% for the top performing agents and models (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) — meaning the agent fails nearly half the time. New York City-based Augmented Intelligence (AUI) Inc., co-founded by Ohad Elhelo and Ori Cohen, believes it has finally come with a solution to boost AI agent reliability to a level where most enterprises can trust they will do as instructed, reliably. The company’s new foundation model, called Apollo-1 — which remains in preview with early testers now but is close to an impending general release — is built on a principle it calls stateful neuro-symbolic reasoning.It&#x27;s a hybrid architecture championed by even LLM skeptics like Gary Marcus, designed to guarantee consistent, policy-compliant outcomes in every customer interaction.“Conversational AI is essentially two halves,” said Elhelo in a recent interview with VentureBeat. “The first half — open-ended dialogue — is handled beautifully by LLMs. They’re designed for creative or exploratory use cases. The other half is task-oriented dialogue, where there’s always a specific goal behind the conversation. That half has remained unsolved because it requires certainty.”AUI defines certainty as the difference between an agent that “probably” performs a task and one that almost “always” does. For example, on TAU-Bench Airline, it performs at a staggering 92.5% pass rate, leaving all the other current competitors far behind in the dust — according to benchmarks shared with VentureBeat and posted on AUI&#x27;s website.Elhelo offered simple examples: a bank that must enforce ID verification for refunds over $200, or an airline that must always offer a business-class upgrade before economy. “Those aren’t preferences,” he said. “They’re requirements. And no purely generative approach can deliver that kind of behavioral certainty.”AUI and its work on improving reliability was previously covered by subscription news outlet The Information, but has not received widespread coverage in publicly accessible media — until now. From Pattern Matching to Predictable ActionThe team argues that transformer models, by design, can’t meet that bar. Large language models generate plausible text, not guaranteed behavior. “When you tell an LLM to always offer insurance before payment, it might — usually,” Elhelo said. “Configure Apollo-1 with that rule, and it will — every time.”That distinction, he said, stems from the architecture itself. Transformers predict the next token in a sequence. Apollo-1, by contrast, predicts the next action in a conversation, operating on what AUI calls a typed symbolic state.Cohen explained the idea in more technical terms. “Neuro-symbolic means we’re merging the two dominant paradigms,” he said. “The symbolic layer gives you structure — it knows what an intent, an entity, and a parameter are — while the neural layer gives you language fluency. The neuro-symbolic reasoner sits between them. It’s a different kind of brain for dialogue.”Where transformers treat every output as text generation, Apollo-1 runs a closed reasoning loop: an encoder translates natural language into a symbolic state, a state machine maintains that state, a decision engine determines the next action, a planner executes it, and a decoder turns the result back into language. “The process is iterative,” Cohen said. “It loops until the task is done. That’s how you get determinism instead of probability.”A Foundation Model for Task ExecutionUnlike traditional chatbots or bespoke automation systems, Apollo-1 is meant to serve as a foundation model for task-oriented dialogue — a single, domain-agnostic system that can be configured for banking, travel, retail, or insurance through what AUI calls a System Prompt.“The System Prompt isn’t a configuration file,” Elhelo said. “It’s a behavioral contract. You define exactly how your agent must behave in situations of interest, and Apollo-1 guarantees those behaviors will execute.”Organizations can use the prompt to encode symbolic slots — intents, parameters, and policies — as well as tool boundaries and state-dependent rules. A food delivery app, for example, might enforce “if allergy mentioned, always inform the restaurant,” while a telecom provider might define “after three failed payment attempts, suspend service.” In both cases, the behavior executes deterministically, not statistically.Eight Years in the MakingAUI’s path to Apollo-1 began in 2017, when the team started encoding millions of real task-oriented conversations handled by a 60,000-person human agent workforce. That work led to a symbolic language capable of separating procedural knowledge — steps, constraints, and flows — from descriptive knowledge like entities and attributes.“The insight was that task-oriented dialogue has universal procedural patterns,” said Elhelo. “Food delivery, claims processing, and order management all share similar structures. Once you model that explicitly, you can compute over it deterministically.”From there, the company built the neuro-symbolic reasoner — a system that uses the symbolic state to decide what happens next rather than guessing through token prediction.Benchmarks suggest the architecture makes a measurable difference. In AUI’s own evaluations, Apollo-1 achieved over 90 percent task completion on the τ-Bench-Airline benchmark, compared with 60 percent for Claude-4. It completed 83 percent of live booking chats on Google Flights versus 22 percent for Gemini 2.5-Flash, and 91 percent of retail scenarios on Amazon versus 17 percent for Rufus.“These aren’t incremental improvements,” said Cohen. “They’re order-of-magnitude reliability differences.”A Complement, Not a CompetitorAUI isn’t pitching Apollo-1 as a replacement for large language models, but as their necessary counterpart. In Elhelo’s words: “Transformers optimize for creative probability. Apollo-1 optimizes for behavioral certainty. Together, they form the complete spectrum of conversational AI.”The model is already running in limited pilots with undisclosed Fortune 500 companies across sectors including finance, travel, and retail. AUI has also confirmed a strategic partnership with Google and plans for general availability in November 2025, when it will open APIs, release full documentation, and add voice and image capabilities. Interested potential customers and partners can sign up to receive more information when it becomes available on AUI&#x27;s website form.Until then, the company is keeping details under wraps. When asked about what comes next, Elhelo smiled. “Let’s just say we’re preparing an announcement,” he said. “Soon.”Toward Conversations That ActFor all its technical sophistication, Apollo-1’s pitch is simple: make AI that businesses can trust to act — not just talk. “We’re on a mission to democratize access to AI that works,” Cohen said near the end of the interview.Whether Apollo-1 becomes the new standard for task-oriented dialogue remains to be seen. But if AUI’s architecture performs as promised, the long-standing divide between chatbots that sound human and agents that reliably do human work may finally start to close.",

For example, on TAU-Bench Airline, it performs at a staggering 92.5% pass rate, leaving all the other current competitors far behind in the dust — according to benchmarks shared with VentureBeat and posted on AUI&#x27;s website.Elhelo offered simple examples: a bank that must enforce ID verification for refunds over $200, or an airline that must always offer a business-class upgrade before economy. “Those aren’t preferences,” he said. “They’re requirements. And no purely generative approach can deliver that kind of behavioral certainty.”AUI and its work on improving reliability was previously covered by subscription news outlet The Information, but has not received widespread coverage in publicly accessible media — until now. From Pattern Matching to Predictable ActionThe team argues that transformer models, by design, can’t meet that bar. Large language models generate plausible text, not guaranteed behavior. “When you tell an LLM to always offer insurance before payment, it might — usually,” Elhelo said. “Configure Apollo-1 with that rule, and it will — every time.”That distinction, he said, stems from the architecture itself. Transformers predict the next token in a sequence. Apollo-1, by contrast, predicts the next action in a conversation, operating on what AUI calls a typed symbolic state.Cohen explained the idea in more technical terms. “Neuro-symbolic means we’re merging the two dominant paradigms,” he said. “The symbolic layer gives you structure — it knows what an intent, an entity, and a parameter are — while the neural layer gives you language fluency. The neuro-symbolic reasoner sits between them. It’s a different kind of brain for dialogue.”Where transformers treat every output as text generation, Apollo-1 runs a closed reasoning loop: an encoder translates natural language into a symbolic state, a state machine maintains that state, a decision engine determines the next action, a planner executes it, and a decoder turns the result back into language. “The process is iterative,” Cohen said. “It loops until the task is done. That’s how you get determinism instead of probability.”A Foundation Model for Task ExecutionUnlike traditional chatbots or bespoke automation systems, Apollo-1 is meant to serve as a foundation model for task-oriented dialogue — a single, domain-agnostic system that can be configured for banking, travel, retail, or insurance through what AUI calls a System Prompt.“The System Prompt isn’t a configuration file,” Elhelo said. “It’s a behavioral contract. You define exactly how your agent must behave in situations of interest, and Apollo-1 guarantees those behaviors will execute.”Organizations can use the prompt to encode symbolic slots — intents, parameters, and policies — as well as tool boundaries and state-dependent rules. A food delivery app, for example, might enforce “if allergy mentioned, always inform the restaurant,” while a telecom provider might define “after three failed payment attempts, suspend service.” In both cases, the behavior executes deterministically, not statistically.Eight Years in the MakingAUI’s path to Apollo-1 began in 2017, when the team started encoding millions of real task-oriented conversations handled by a 60,000-person human agent workforce. That work led to a symbolic language capable of separating procedural knowledge — steps, constraints, and flows — from descriptive knowledge like entities and attributes.“The insight was that task-oriented dialogue has universal procedural patterns,” said Elhelo. “Food delivery, claims processing, and order management all share similar structures. Once you model that explicitly, you can compute over it deterministically.”From there, the company built the neuro-symbolic reasoner — a system that uses the symbolic state to decide what happens next rather than guessing through token prediction.Benchmarks suggest the architecture makes a measurable difference. In AUI’s own evaluations, Apollo-1 achieved over 90 percent task completion on the τ-Bench-Airline benchmark, compared with 60 percent for Claude-4. It completed 83 percent of live booking chats on Google Flights versus 22 percent for Gemini 2.5-Flash, and 91 percent of retail scenarios on Amazon versus 17 percent for Rufus.“These aren’t incremental improvements,” said Cohen. “They’re order-of-magnitude reliability differences.”A Complement, Not a CompetitorAUI isn’t pitching Apollo-1 as a replacement for large language models, but as their necessary counterpart. In Elhelo’s words: “Transformers optimize for creative probability. Apollo-1 optimizes for behavioral certainty. Together, they form the complete spectrum of conversational AI.”The model is already running in limited pilots with undisclosed Fortune 500 companies across sectors including finance, travel, and retail. AUI has also confirmed a strategic partnership with Google and plans for general availability in November 2025, when it will open APIs, release full documentation, and add voice and image capabilities. Interested potential customers and partners can sign up to receive more information when it becomes available on AUI&#x27;s website form.Until then, the company is keeping details under wraps. When asked about what comes next, Elhelo smiled. “Let’s just say we’re preparing an announcement,” he said. “Soon.”Toward Conversations That ActFor all its technical sophistication, Apollo-1’s pitch is simple: make AI that businesses can trust to act — not just talk. “We’re on a mission to democratize access to AI that works,” Cohen said near the end of the interview.Whether Apollo-1 becomes the new standard for task-oriented dialogue remains to be seen. But if AUI’s architecture performs as promised, the long-standing divide between chatbots that sound human and agents that reliably do human work may finally start to close.",

          "standfirst": "The entry-level Apple iPad with the A16 chip is on sale for $280 as a Prime Day promotion. This is a discount of around $70 and represents a record-low price for the 11-inch tablet. The deal is available in multiple colorways and is one of the best Apple deals for Prime Day this year. This tablet made our list of the best iPads and we particularly recommend it for the budget-conscious. It may lack some of the bells and whistles of its more expensive cousins, but it still gets the job done. It's fast enough for most common tasks and the battery life is solid, at 10 hours per charge. It also ships with 6GB of RAM, which is a decent enough metric. The tablet integrates with Wi-Fi 6 and features a USB-C connector, along with a pair of 12MP cameras. There's also a Touch ID sensor, which can be used to unlock the device and to make payments. This is the most basic tablet in Apple's lineup, so it lacks some features. It doesn't integrate with the Apple Pencil Pro or the Magic Keyboard. The display is also not quite as gorgeous as the iPad Air or Pro, but it's still a Liquid Retina panel. Elsewhere among the Apple deals for Prime Day, you can get $150 off the iPad Air — both the 11-inch model and the 13-inch model.

It's not a huge discount, but it matches the best price we've seen these cans drop to since they debuted earlier this year. The WH-1000XM6 takes a leap forward in sound quality, active noise cancellation (ANC) and other features. Our audio reviewer, Billy Steele, called them the best headphones you can buy right now. \"The crown is safe once again,\" he wrote. \"Sony has managed to overhaul its flagship headphones in all the right ways that keep the 1000X line atop our best headphones list.\" The XM6 has a powerful new chip, the QN3, that unlocks much of its potential. Sony also developed new drivers for this model, resulting in richer details, clearer vocals and a better overall balance. The headphones added four extra microphones to enhance ANC. The XM6 is especially improved at blocking out voices. If you're a fan of spatial effects, which simulate a wider soundstage, Sony added that for this generation. The (optional) 360 Spatial Sound feature transforms regular stereo content into something with a surround-sound effect. It's similar to what Apple and Bose have in their models. It's yet another audio effect option in Sony's app, alongside 360 Reality Audio and DSEE Extreme upscaling. The headphones are no slouch in the battery life department. The XM6 is rated for up to 30 hours with ANC on and up to 40 hours with it off. In Engadget's testing, we had no problem hitting those advertised figures. If you'd rather save more money for a lesser (but still great) pair of cans, Sony's last-gen model is also on sale. You can get the WH-1000XM5 for $100 off. The 2022 flagship headphones offer premium sound, ANC, and battery life. Typically $400, you can get them during October Prime Day for $298.

Prime Day deals have brought such discounts: the Apple Watch Series 10 is on sale for $279, a record low for this model. This particular deal applies to the 42mm GPS version of the Apple Watch Series 10 in a variety of color options. And while it is no longer Apple’s flagship smartwatch, with the Series 11 succeeding it last month, it was comfortably our top pick for the best smartwatch until that arrived. Considering its regular list price starts at $399 (the same as the 42mm Series 11), you’re saving some serious cash if you opt for the older device. In our 90-scoring review, we warned any Series 8 or 9 Apple Watch owners that the Series 10 was a fairly unspectacular iterative update, but for first-time buyers or people looking to upgrade from an older model, it’s very easy to recommend. Its larger display makes it easier to check notifications than on previous Apple Watches, while the thinner frame means it looks nicer too. The former flagship Apple Watch unsurprisingly excels at health and fitness tracking, and the blood oxygen app that Apple was forced to remove when the watch launched is now available again after a redesign.

One of the best is on the Dyson V8 Plus, which you can pick up for $300 or 44 percent off. The Dyson V8 Plus is the same basic vacuum as the original V8, just with a wider selection of accessories that should ideally make it even more essential to your cleaning routine. The Dyson V8 Plus has 115AW of suction, and a 40-minute run time that should give you more than enough flexibility to clean a small home or apartment. Dyson also says the vacuum's filter can capture 99.9 percent of dust, particles and allergens. Like some of Dyson's other stick vacuums, the Dyson V8 Plus can work in handheld mode when you need to get in the crevices of couch cushions or shelves. It's also designed to easily empty dust and debris directly into a trash can without having to unscrew its filter. In terms of accessories, purchasing the V8 Plus gets you the main \"Motorbar\" cleaner head, a hair screw attachment for untangling long hairs, a mini soft dusting brush for sweeping off flat surfaces and a crevice tool for getting into small spaces. The Dyson V8 Plus, while good, isn't on Engadget's best cordless vacuums list, but a pick from the list is on sale for Prime Day. You can get the Dyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 during Amazon's sale, a not insignificant discount on a vacuum that's typically sold for more than $800. The Dyson V15 Detect Plus offers 240AW of suction in comparison to the V8 Plus' 115AW, and it can run for 60 minutes on a single charge, giving you even more time to clean. You'll also get more accessories in comparison to Dyson's other vacuum. On top of the usual suspects like the hair screw tool and the mini dusting brush, the V15 Detect Plus also supports the company's \"Fluffy Optic\" cleaner head, which uses a built-in light to reveal hidden dust and hair.

It's a great value at $499, but when it's $150 off like it is for Amazon Prime Day, you'll be hard-pressed to find a better smartphone in this price range. You can pick it up for only $349 during the sale, or step up to either the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro, which both are on sale for the first time. The Pixel 9a may lack the cutting-edge sizzle of ultra-premium phones that cost triple what you'll pay here. But in return, you get strong performance, a sleek design, a robust battery that lasts over 28 hours and camera quality that rivals that of competitors costing $1,000 or more. The phone has a simple design with an aluminum frame and a recycled polycarbonate back. It has an IP68 rating for solid protection against dust and water. On the front, you have a spacious 6.3-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The screen's brightness can reach an impressive 2,700 nits, matching the standard Pixel 9. Its resolution is a crisp 1080 x 2424 (422 PPI). In Engadget's tests, the Pixel 9a's camera \"preserved more details and produced a generally better-looking image\" than the Galaxy S25 Ultra's. (If you aren't familiar, that's a $1,300 phone.) The Pixel 9a does lack a dedicated telephoto lens. But Google has included the Super Res Zoom AI upscaling feature to help compensate for the loss. Amazon's deal includes all four colors available for the phone: obsidian, porcelain, peony and iris. There's no guarantee stock will last through all of October Prime Day, so you may want to consider pouncing soon if this deal is for you. Also on sale are the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro, which you can pick up for $$649 and $799, respectively.

Its resolution is a crisp 1080 x 2424 (422 PPI). In Engadget's tests, the Pixel 9a's camera \"preserved more details and produced a generally better-looking image\" than the Galaxy S25 Ultra's. (If you aren't familiar, that's a $1,300 phone.) The Pixel 9a does lack a dedicated telephoto lens. But Google has included the Super Res Zoom AI upscaling feature to help compensate for the loss. Amazon's deal includes all four colors available for the phone: obsidian, porcelain, peony and iris. There's no guarantee stock will last through all of October Prime Day, so you may want to consider pouncing soon if this deal is for you. Also on sale are the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro, which you can pick up for $$649 and $799, respectively.

Apple's entry-level wireless earbuds are down to $90 for October Prime Day, or 30 percent off their normal rate. That's also the lowest we've seen them, and one of the best Prime Day Apple deals you can get. When Apple updated its standard AirPods in 2024, it released two models: one with active noise cancellation (ANC) and one without. We consider the non-ANC models to be the best budget AirPods you can get, so they're an even better buy at this sale price. The ANC versions are also discounted at the moment, so you can pick them up for $120 instead of the usual $180. The AirPods' H2 chip brings a bunch of Pro-adjacent features to the standard model. That list includes Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, Transparency, Personalized Spatial Audio and wireless charging. For calls, it supports Voice Isolation, which helps filter out background noise and make it easier for you to be heard. And if that call is via FaceTime, it supports Apple's 48kHz \"cinema-quality\" audio. Sound is improved over the AirPods 3. \"There's more low-end tone than the previous model right out of the gate, and the punchier treble opens the sound stage so it's wider and more immersive,\" Engadget's Billy Steele wrote. \"The improved frequency response is on full display with Dolby Atmos content (movies, music, and TV), but the AirPods 4 are also more sonically adept with non-spatial tunes and video.\" You can expect around five hours of battery life on a single charge. With the ANC model, that estimate drops to around four hours with the marquee feature activated. With either version, you can drop them in the charging case to extend their total time to around 30 hours. And hey, it's good to give your ears a rest now and then anyway.

IBM&#x27;s announcements represent a three-pronged strategy to address interconnected enterprise AI challenges: modernizing legacy code, governing AI agents in production and bridging the prototype-to-production gap..The company claims 6,000 internal developers within IBM have used Project Bob, achieving an average productivity gain of 45% and a 22-43% increase in code commits .Project Bob isn&#x27;t another vibe coder, it&#x27;s an enterprise modernization toolThere is no shortage of AI-powered coding tools in the market today, including tools like GitHub Copilot and vibe coding tools such as Replit, Cursor, Bolt and Lovable.\"Project Bob takes a fundamentally different approach from tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor,\" Bruno Aziza, IBM&#x27;s Vice President of Data, AI and Analytics Strategy told VentureBeat.Aziza said that Project Bob is enterprise-focused and maintains full-repository context across editing sessions. It automates complex tasks like Java 8 to more modern version of Java and framework upgrades from Struts or JSF to React, Angular or Liberty.The architecture orchestrates between Anthropic&#x27;s Claude, Mistral, Meta&#x27;s Llama and IBM&#x27;s recently released Granite 4 models through a data-driven model selection approach. The system routes tasks to whichever LLM is best suited, balancing accuracy, latency and cost in real time.\"It understands the entire repository, development intent and security standards, enabling developers to design, debug, refactor and modernize code without breaking flow,” he said.Among 6,000 early adopters within IBM, 95% used Bob for task completion rather than code generation. The tool integrates DevSecOps practices like vulnerability detection and compliance checks directly into the IDE.\"Bob goes beyond code assistance — it orchestrates intelligence across the entire software development lifecycle, helping teams ship secure, modern software faster,\" he said.Project Bob benefits from new Anthropic partnershipPart of Project Bob is a new partnership between IBM and AnthropicThe two vendors announced a partnership to integrate Claude models directly into the watsonx portfolio, starting with Project Bob. The collaboration extends beyond model integration to include what IBM describes as a first-of-its-kind guide for enterprise AI agent deployment.IBM and Anthropic co-created \"A Guide to Architecting Secure Enterprise AI Agents with MCP Servers,\" focused on the Agent Development Lifecycle (ADLC). The ADLC framework provides a structured approach to designing, deploying and managing enterprise AI systems. MCP refers to Model Context Protocol, Anthropic&#x27;s widely embraced open standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems and data they need to work with.Making it easier to build enterprise-grade AI agentsIn addition to Project Bob, IBM announced that it is extending its watsonx Orchestrate technology to integrate the open source Langflow visual agent builder. Langflow is an open-source technology that is led by DataStax, which itself was acquired by IBM in May of this year. The integration of Langflow is intended to address what Aziza calls the \"prototype to production chasm.\"\"Today, there&#x27;s no seamless path from open-source prototyping to enterprise-grade systems that are reliable, compliant and scalable,\" Aziza said. \"Watsonx Orchestrate transforms Langflow-like agentic composition into an enterprise-grade orchestration platform by adding governance, security, scalability, compliance, and operational robustness — making it production-ready for mission-critical use.” Aziza explained that the integration of Langflow with watsonx Orchestration brings critical capabilities on top of the open-source tool including:Agent lifecycle framework: Provisioning, versioning, deployment and monitoring with multi-agent coordination and role-based access.Integrated AI governance: Embedded watsonx.governance provides audit trails, explainability for agent decisions, bias and drift monitoring and policy enforcement. Langflow has no native governance controls.Enterprise infrastructure: SaaS or on-premises hosting with data isolation, SSO/LDAP integration and fine-grained permissions. Langflow users must manage their own infrastructure and security.No-code and pro-code options: Langflow is \"low-code.\" IBM added a visual, no-code Agent Builder and a pro-code Agent Development Kit for seamless promotion from prototype to production.Pre-built domain agents: Catalog of HR, IT and finance agents integrated with Workday, SAP and ServiceNow.Production observability: Built-in dashboards, analytics and enterprise support SLAs with continuous performance monitoring.AgentOps and Agentic Workflows: From building to governingIBM is also introducing two new capabilities to watsonx Orchestrate that work in tandem with the Langflow integration: Agentic Workflows for standardized agent coordination and AgentOps for production governance. Agentic Workflows addresses what Aziza calls the \"brittle scripts\" problem. Today developers build agents using custom scripts that break when scaled across enterprise environments. Agentic Workflows provides standardized, reusable flows that sequence multiple agents and tools consistently. This connects directly to the Langflow integration. While Langflow provides the visual interface for building individual agents, Agentic Workflows handles the orchestration layer, coordinating multiple agents and tools into repeatable enterprise processes. AgentOps then provides the governance and observability for those running workflows. The new built-in observability layer provides real-time monitoring and policy-based controls across the full agent lifecycle.The governance gap becomes concrete in enterprise scenarios. Without AgentOps, an HR onboarding agent might set up benefits and payroll but teams lack visibility into whether it&#x27;s applying policies correctly until problems surface. With AgentOps, every action is monitored in real time, allowing anomalies to be flagged and corrected immediately.What this means for enterprisesTechnical debt is something that many organizations struggle with and it can represent a non-trivial barrier for organizations looking to get into agentic AI deployments. Project Bob&#x27;s value proposition is clearest for organizations with significant legacy Java codebases. The 45% productivity gains IBM measured internally suggest meaningful acceleration for Java 8 to more modern versions of Java and framework upgrades from Struts or JSF to modern architectures. However, these metrics come from IBM developers working on IBM systems. The critical unknown is whether the multi-model orchestration delivers the same results on customer codebases with different architectural patterns, technical debt profiles and team skill levels.The Langflow integration addresses a genuine gap for teams already using open source agent frameworks. The challenge isn&#x27;t building agents with tools like LangChain, LangGraph or n8n. It&#x27;s adding the governance layer, lifecycle management, enterprise security controls and observability required for production deployment.For enterprises looking to lead in AI adoption, IBM&#x27;s announcements serve to reinforce the fact that governance infrastructure is now table stakes. You can build agents quickly with existing tools. Scaling them safely requires the lifecycle management, observability and policy controls.Project Bob is now available in private tech preview with broader availability expected in the future. IBM is accepting access requests through its developer portal. Its AgentOps and agentic workflows integrations are now available in watsonx Orchestrate, while its Langflow integration is expected to be generally available at the end of this month.",

Langflow has no native governance controls.Enterprise infrastructure: SaaS or on-premises hosting with data isolation, SSO/LDAP integration and fine-grained permissions. Langflow users must manage their own infrastructure and security.No-code and pro-code options: Langflow is \"low-code.\" IBM added a visual, no-code Agent Builder and a pro-code Agent Development Kit for seamless promotion from prototype to production.Pre-built domain agents: Catalog of HR, IT and finance agents integrated with Workday, SAP and ServiceNow.Production observability: Built-in dashboards, analytics and enterprise support SLAs with continuous performance monitoring.AgentOps and Agentic Workflows: From building to governingIBM is also introducing two new capabilities to watsonx Orchestrate that work in tandem with the Langflow integration: Agentic Workflows for standardized agent coordination and AgentOps for production governance. Agentic Workflows addresses what Aziza calls the \"brittle scripts\" problem. Today developers build agents using custom scripts that break when scaled across enterprise environments. Agentic Workflows provides standardized, reusable flows that sequence multiple agents and tools consistently. This connects directly to the Langflow integration. While Langflow provides the visual interface for building individual agents, Agentic Workflows handles the orchestration layer, coordinating multiple agents and tools into repeatable enterprise processes. AgentOps then provides the governance and observability for those running workflows. The new built-in observability layer provides real-time monitoring and policy-based controls across the full agent lifecycle.The governance gap becomes concrete in enterprise scenarios. Without AgentOps, an HR onboarding agent might set up benefits and payroll but teams lack visibility into whether it&#x27;s applying policies correctly until problems surface. With AgentOps, every action is monitored in real time, allowing anomalies to be flagged and corrected immediately.What this means for enterprisesTechnical debt is something that many organizations struggle with and it can represent a non-trivial barrier for organizations looking to get into agentic AI deployments. Project Bob&#x27;s value proposition is clearest for organizations with significant legacy Java codebases. The 45% productivity gains IBM measured internally suggest meaningful acceleration for Java 8 to more modern versions of Java and framework upgrades from Struts or JSF to modern architectures. However, these metrics come from IBM developers working on IBM systems. The critical unknown is whether the multi-model orchestration delivers the same results on customer codebases with different architectural patterns, technical debt profiles and team skill levels.The Langflow integration addresses a genuine gap for teams already using open source agent frameworks. The challenge isn&#x27;t building agents with tools like LangChain, LangGraph or n8n. It&#x27;s adding the governance layer, lifecycle management, enterprise security controls and observability required for production deployment.For enterprises looking to lead in AI adoption, IBM&#x27;s announcements serve to reinforce the fact that governance infrastructure is now table stakes. You can build agents quickly with existing tools. Scaling them safely requires the lifecycle management, observability and policy controls.Project Bob is now available in private tech preview with broader availability expected in the future. IBM is accepting access requests through its developer portal. Its AgentOps and agentic workflows integrations are now available in watsonx Orchestrate, while its Langflow integration is expected to be generally available at the end of this month.",

          "standfirst": "OpenAI launched an agent builder that the company hopes will eliminate fragmented tools and make it easier for enterprises to utilize OpenAI’s system to create agents. AgentKit, announced during OpenAI’s DevDay in San Francisco, enables developers and enterprises to build agents and add chat capabilities in one place, potentially competing with platforms like Zapier. By offering a more streamlined way to create agents, OpenAI advances further into becoming a full-stack application provider.“Until now, building agents meant juggling fragmented tools—complex orchestration with no versioning, custom connectors, manual eval pipelines, prompt tuning, and weeks of frontend work before launch,” the company said in a blog post. AgentKit includes:Agent Builder, which is a visual canvas where devs can see what they’ve created and versioning multi-agent workflowsConnector Registry is a central area for admins to manage connections across OpenAI products. A Global Admin console will be a prerequisite to using this feature.ChatKit enables users to integrate chat-based agents into their user interfaces. Eventually, OpenAI said it will build a standalone Workflows API and add agent deployment tabs to ChatGPT. OpenAI also expanded evaluation for agents, adding capabilities such as datasets with automated graders and annotations, trace grading that runs end-to-end assessments of workflows, automated prompt optimization, and support for third-party agent measurement tools. Developers can access some features of AgentKit, but OpenAI is gradually rolling out additional features, such as Agent Builder. Currently, Agent Builder is available in beta, while ChatKit and new evaluation capabilities are generally available. Connector Registry “is beginning its beta rollout to some API and ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu users. OpenAI said pricing for AgentKit tools will be included in the standard API model pricing. Agent BuilderTo clarify, many agents are built using OpenAI’s models; however, enterprises often access GPT-5 through other platforms to create their own agents. However, AgentKit brings enterprises more into its ecosystem, ensuring they don’t need to tap other platforms as often. Demonstrated during DevDay, the company stated that Agent Builder is ideal for rapid iteration. It also provides developers with visibility into how the agents are working. During the demo, an OpenAI developer made an agent that reads the DevDay agenda and suggests panels to watch. It took her just under eight minutes. Other model providers saw the importance of offering developer toolkits to build agents to entice enterprises to use more of their tools. Google came out with its Agent Development Kit in April, expanding multi-agent system building “in under 100 lines of code.” Microsoft, which runs the popular agent framework AutoGen, announced it is bringing agent creation to one place with its new Agent Framework.OpenAI customers, such as the fintech company Ramp, stated in a blog post that its teams were able to build a procurement agent in a few hours instead of months. “Agent Builder transformed what once took months of complex orchestration, custom code, and manual optimizations into just a couple of hours. The visual canvas keeps product, legal, and engineering on the same page, slashing iteration cycles by 70% and getting an agent live in two sprints rather than two quarters,” Ramp said. AgentKit’s Connector Registry would also enable enterprises to manage and maintain data across workspaces, consolidating data sources into a single panel that spans both ChatGPT and the API. It will have pre-built connectors to Dropbox, Google Drive, SharePoint and Microsoft Teams. It also supports third-party MCP servers. Another capability of Agent Builder is Guardrails, an open-source safety layer that protects against the leakage of personally identifiable information (PII), jailbreaks, and unintended or malicious behavior.Bringing more chat Since most agentic interactions involve chat, it makes sense to simplify the process for developers to set up chat interfaces and connect them with the agents they’ve just built. “Deploying chat UIs for agents can be surprisingly complex—handling streaming responses, managing threads, showing the model thinking and designing engaging in-chat experiences,” OpenAI said. The company said ChatKit makes it simple to embed chat agents on platforms and embed these into apps or websites. However, some OpenAI competitors have begun thinking beyond the chatbot and want to offer agentic interactions that feel more seamless. Google’s asynchronous coding agent, Jules, has introduced a new feature that enables users to interact with the agent through the command-line interface, eliminating the need to open a chat window. Responses The response to AgentKit has mainly been positive, with some developers noting that while it simplifies agent building, it doesn’t mean that everyone can now build agents. Several developers view Agent Kit not as a Zapier killer, but rather as a tool that complements the pipeline. Zapier debuted a no-code tool for building AI agents and bots, called Zapier Central, in 2024.",

          "standfirst": "OpenAI&#x27;s annual conference for third-party developers, DevDay, kicked off with a bang today as co-founder and CEO Sam Altman announced a new \"Apps SDK,\" or software development kit, that makes it \"possible to build apps inside of ChatGPT,\" including paid apps, which companies can charge users for using OpenAI&#x27;s recently unveiled Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP). In other words, instead of launching apps one-by-one on your phone, computer, or on the web — now you can do all that without ever leaving ChatGPT. This feature allows the user to log-into their accounts on those external apps and bring all their information back into ChatGPT, and use the apps very similarly to how they already do outside of the chatbot, but now with the ability to ask ChatGPT to perform certain actions, analyze content, or go beyond what each app could offer on its own. You can direct Canva to make you slides based on a text description, ask Zillow for home listings in a certain area fitting certain requirements, or ask Coursera about a specific lesson&#x27;s content while dit plays on video, all from within ChatGPT — with many other apps also already offering their own connections (see below).\"This will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive and personalized, that you can chat with,\" Altman said.While the Apps SDK is available today in preview, OpenAI said it would not begin accepting new apps within ChatGPT or allow them to charge users until \"later this year.\"ChatGPT in-line app access is already rolling out to ChatGPT Free, Plus, Go and Pro users — outside of the European Union only for now — with Business, Enterprise, and Education tiers expected to receive access to the apps later this year.Built atop common MCP standardBuilt on the open source standard Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduced by rival Anthropic nearly a year ago, the Apps SDK gives third-party developers working independently or on behalf of enterprises large and small to connect selected data, \"trigger actions, and render a fully interactive UI [user interface]\" Altman explained during his introductory keynote speech. The Apps SDK includes a \"talking to apps\" feature that allows ChatGPT and the underlying GPT-5 or other \"o-series\" models piloting it underneath to obtain updated context from the third-party app or service, so the model \"always knows about exactly what you&#x27;re user is interacting with,\" according to another presenter and OpenAI engineer, Alexi Christakis.Developers can build apps that:appear inline in chat as lightweight cards or carouselsexpand to fullscreen for immersive tasks like maps, menus, or slidesuse picture-in-picture for live sessions such as video, games, or quizzesEach mode is designed to preserve ChatGPT’s minimal, conversational flow while adding interactivity and brand presence.Early integrations with Coursera, Canva, Zillow and more...Christakis showed off early integrations of external apps built atop the Apps SDK, including ones from e-learning company Coursera, cloud design software company Canva, and real estate listings and agent connections search engine, Zillow.Altman also announced Apps SDK integrations with additional partners not demoed officially during the keynote including: Booking.com, Expedia, Figma and Spotify and in documentation, said more upcoming partners are on deck: AllTrails, Peloton, OpenTable, Target, theFork, and Uber, representing lifestyle, commerce, and productivity categories.The Coursera demo included an example of how the user onboards to the external app, including a new login screen for the app (Coursera) that appears within the ChatGPT chat interface, activated simply by a text prompt from the user asking: \"Coursera can you teach me something about machine learning\"?Once logged in, the app launched within the chat interface, \"in line\" and can render anything from the web, including interactive elements like video. Christakis explained and showed the Apps SDK also supports \"picture-in-picture\" and \"fullscreen\" views, allowing the user to choose how to interact with it.When playing a Coursera video that appeared, he showed that it automatically pinned the video to the top of the screen so the user could keep watching it even as they continued to have a back-and-forth dialog in text with ChatGPT in the typical input/output prompts and responses below. Users can then ask ChatGPT about content appearing in the video without specifying exactly what was said, as the Agents SDK pipes the information on the backend, server-side, from the connected app to the underlying ChatGPT AI model. So \"can you explain more about what they&#x27;re saying right now\" will automatically surface the relevant portion of the video and provide that to the underlying AI model for it to analyze and respond to through text.In another example, Christakis opened an older, existing ChatGPT conversation he&#x27;d had about his siblings&#x27; dog walking business and resumed the conversation by asking another third-party app, Canva, to generate a poster using one of ChatGPT&#x27;s recommended business names, \"Walk This Wag,\" along with specific guidance about font choice (\"sans serif\") and overall coloration and style (\"bright and colorful.\")Instead of the user manually having to go and add all those specific elements to a Canva template, ChatGPT went and issued the commands and performed the actions on behalf of the user in the background.After a few minutes, ChatGPT responded with several poster designs generated directly within the Canva app, but displayed them all in the user&#x27;s ChatGPT chat session where they could see, review, enlarge and provide feedback or ask for adjustments on all of them.Christakis then asked for ChatGPT to turn one of the slides into an entire slide deck so the founders of the dog walking business could present it to investors, which did it in the background over several minutes while he presented a final integrated app, Zillow.He started a new chat session and asked a simple question: \"based on our conversations, what would be a good city to expand the dog walking business.\"Using ChatGPT&#x27;s optional memory feature, it referenced the dog walk conversation and suggested Pittsburgh, which Christakis used as a chance to type in \"Zillow\" and \"show me some homes for sale there,\" which called up an interactive map from Zillow with homes for sale and prices listed and hover-over animations, all in-line within ChatGPT.Clicking a specific home also opened a fullscreen view with \"most of the Zillow experience,\" entirely without leaving ChatGPT, including the ability to request home tours and contact agents and filtering by bedrooms and other qualities like outdoor space. ChatGPT pulls up the requested filtered Zillow search as well as provides a text-based response in-line explaining what it did and why.The user can then ask follow-up questions about the specific property — such as \"how close is it to a dog park?\" — or compare it to other properties, all within ChatGPT.It can also use apps in conjunction with its Search function, searching the web to compare the app information (in this case, Zillow) with other sources.Safety, privacy, and developer standardsOpenAI emphasized that apps must comply with strict privacy, safety, and content standards to be listed in the ChatGPT directory. Apps must:serve a clear and valuable purposebe predictable and reliable in behaviorbe safe for general audiences, including teens aged 13–17respect user privacy and limit data collection to only what’s necessaryEvery app must also include a clear, published privacy policy, obtain user consent before connecting, and identify any actions that modify external data (e.g., posting, sending, uploading).Apps violating OpenAI’s usage policies, crashing frequently, or misrepresenting their capabilities may be removed at any time. Developers must submit from verified accounts, provide customer support contacts, and maintain their apps for stability and compliance.OpenAI also published developer design guidelines, outlining how apps should look, sound, and behave. They must follow ChatGPT’s visual system — including consistent color palettes, typography, spacing, and iconography — and maintain accessibility standards such as alt text and readable contrast ratios.Partners can show brand logos and accent colors but not alter ChatGPT’s core interface or use promotional language. Apps should remain “conversational, intelligent, simple, responsive, and accessible,” according to the documentation.A new conversational app ecosystemBy opening ChatGPT to third-party apps and payments, OpenAI is taking a major step toward transforming ChatGPT from a chatbot into a full-fledged AI operating system — one that combines conversational intelligence, rich interfaces, and embedded commerce.For developers, that means direct access to over 800 million ChatGPT users, who can discover apps “at the right time” through natural conversation — whether planning trips, learning, or shopping.For users, it means a new generation of apps you can chat with — where a single interface helps you book a flight, design a slide deck, or learn a new skill without ever leaving ChatGPT.As OpenAI put it: “This is just the start of apps in ChatGPT, bringing new utility to users and new opportunities for developers.”There remain a few big questions, namely: 1. what happens to all the data from those third-party apps as they interface with ChatGPT and its users...does OpenAI get access to it and can it train upon it? 2. What happens to OpenAI&#x27;s once much-hyped GPT Store, which had been in the past promoted as a way for third-party creators and developers to create custom, task-specific versions of ChatGPT and make money on them through a usage-based revenue share model?We&#x27;ve asked the company about both issues and will update when we hear back.",

The left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center gets a top rating, but the Heritage Foundation, a prominent conservative think tank, is a 'blacklisted' and 'deprecated' source that Wikipedia's editors have determined 'promotes disinformation.'\"Read full article Comments",

Companies have used them to build machines with dozens to hundreds of qubits, the error rates are coming down, and they've largely shifted from worrying about basic scientific problems to dealing with engineering challenges. Yet even at this apparently late date in the field's development, there are companies that are still developing entirely new qubit technologies, betting the company that they have identified something that will let them scale in ways that enable a come-from-behind story. Recently, one of those companies published a paper that describes the physics of their qubit system, which involves lone electrons floating on top of liquid helium. Trapping single electrons So how do you get an electron to float on top of helium? To find out, Ars spoke with Johannes Pollanen, the chief scientific officer of EeroQ, the company that's done the new work. He said that it's actually old physics, with the first demonstrations of it having been done half a century ago.Read full article Comments",

But the development of that electric vehicle was shelved earlier last year as CEO Elon Musk began to lose interest with car-making in favor of humanoid robots. However, car sales still make up the overwhelming majority of Tesla's revenue, and the removal of the IRS clean vehicle tax credit at the end of September may have juiced US EV sales in Q3 2025, but sales are expected to dip significantly in the current quarter. The new Standard Range Model Y starts at $39,990, with 321 miles (516 km) of range from its rear-wheel drive powertrain, compared to the now-Premium rear-wheel drive Model Y, which has an EPA range of 357 miles (574 km).

The presentation ceremony will take place in Stockholm on December 10, 2025. \"To put it mildly, it was the surprise of my life,\" Clarke told reporters by phone during this morning's press conference. \"Our discovery in some ways is the basis of quantum computing. Exactly at this moment where this fits in is not entirely clear to me. One of the underlying reasons that cellphones work is because of all this work.\" When physicists began delving into the strange new realm of subatomic particles in the early 20th century, they discovered a realm where the old, deterministic laws of classical physics no longer apply. Instead, uncertainty reigns supreme. It is a world governed not by absolutes, but by probabilities, where events that would seem impossible on the macroscale occur on a regular basis.Read full article Comments",

That means the first elements of the antitrust remedies won by Epic Games will have to be implemented in mere weeks. The app store case is one of three ongoing antitrust actions against Google, but it's the furthest along of them. Google lost the case in 2023, and in 2024, US District Judge James Donato ordered a raft of sweeping changes aimed at breaking Google's illegal monopoly on Android app distribution. In July, Google lost its initial appeal, leaving it with little time before the mandated changes must begin. Its petition to the Supreme Court was Google's final Hail Mary to avoid opening the Play Store even a crack. Google asked the justices to pause remedies pending its appeal, but the court has declined to do so, Reuters reports. Hopefully, Google planned for this eventuality because it must implement the first phase of the remedies by October 22.Read full article Comments",

The SDK is built on the open source Model Context Protocol (MCP), Altman said. That means developers that already use MCP only need to add an HTML resource to enable ChatGPT integration, he added. The new integration means a ChatGPT user can directly ask Figma to turn a sketch into a diagram, for instance, and get results integrated into their ChatGPT conversation. It also means that ChatGPT can suggest apps that might be suited to a more general query, like recommending and creating a Spotify playlist when someone asks for song suggestions.Read full article Comments",

Split View was reasonably easy to recreate with the new system, but users who had relied on Slide Over bemoaned the lack of an equivalent feature in iPadOS 26. Apple apparently agrees because the second developer beta of the upcoming iPadOS 26.1 adds Slide Over support back into the operating system (as reported by MacRumors). Like the old Slide Over window, the new one sits on top of all your other apps and can be invoked and dismissed whenever you want.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi were awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for their collective work in the discovery of specialized immune cells that roam the body and keep potentially harmful immune responses in check—preventing them from attacking the body directly (autoimmune responses) or causing harm with overzealous responses to invaders. Those specialized cells—regulatory T cells—are now well established as playing a key role in peripheral immune tolerance. That is, a non-central process that allows the immune system to strike a delicate balance between being appropriately responsive and aggressive toward intruding germs or foreign dangers while also not running amok. Before the trio of prize winners came along, researchers thought that such immune tolerance occurred centrally, in the thymus, the primary lymphoid organ that sits in the center of the chest. There, T cells mature, including into two key types: T helper cells, which go on to trigger immune responses when they recognize foreign dangers; and the aptly named T killer cells, which kill cells, including foreign cells, cancer cells, and cells infected by a virus.Read full article Comments",

In their complaint, a group of plaintiffs who would have benefited from the EPA's \"Solar for All\" program—including a labor union, several businesses, and a homeowner who cannot afford her electricity bills without it—accused the EPA of violating federal law and the Constitution by unlawfully terminating the program. Solar for All was \"expected to save an estimated $350 million annually on energy bills during and after the five-year program, providing energy bill relief for more than 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households,\" plaintiffs noted. Additionally, it was \"expected to secure 4,000 megawatts of new solar energy over five years and generate 200,000 new jobs.\"Read full article Comments",

          "content": "“Illusions are fun, but they are also a gateway to perception,” says Hyeyoung Shin, assistant professor of neuroscience at Seoul National University. Shin is the first author of a new study in Nature Neuroscience that has identified a specific population of neurons in the visual cortex—dubbed IC-encoders—and shows their direct role in representing a visual illusion. The work is the result of a collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley, the Allen Institute in Seattle, and Seoul National University. What the brain “knows” Illusory contours are edges we see even though they aren’t physically there. A classic example is the Kanizsa triangle: three “Pac-Man” shapes make us perceive a bright white triangle floating on top. Hide the Pac-Men with your fingers and the trick is revealed: There is no border, just a uniform background. Neurophysiology agrees with perception here: For over 20 years, studies in primates and later imaging in humans and mice have described neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas that respond to real and illusory contours.

          "content": "Few modern F1 venues are as dazzling as the Marina Bay circuit in Singapore. If you watch the early practice or the young women of F1 Academy in their races, you'll get an idea of the street circuit's relationship to the city in daylight as it takes in landmarks and crosses the water. At night, the brilliant white ribbon of racetrack throws the rest of the surroundings into darkness. Unlike a Le Mans car, there are no headlights in F1. Just over 1,600 lights are needed for the job, which got underway in mid-June. They're LED now, a switch made in 2023 that cut energy consumption by a noticeable 30 percent. The light itself is even carefully tuned—a color of 5,700 K and a color rendering index of 90 best replicate daylight for the drivers. Oh, and there can't be any flickering that could affect the TV broadcast. The results look spectacular, especially in 4K. As for the racing this year? Perhaps not so much. Past Singaporean Grands Prix have tended to be action-packed—or even chaotic. In the inaugural 2008 race, Red Bull came away convinced that electromagnetic interference from an underground train line caused the failure of one of its race cars, as well as a sister car belonging to the team we now call Racing Bulls. Other teams remained worried about this phenomenon as late as 2015, although no similar failures had been recorded. For the record, Singapore's Land Transit Authority says there was no train track below the relevant corner of the circuit—the nearest train tunnel is more than 600 feet away (200 m) and 32 feet (10 m) below ground level.Read full article Comments",
