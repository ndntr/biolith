          "standfirst": "You may not be looking to spend big on tech this October Prime Day, but it's still a good idea to look for tech essentials during the shopping event while you can get some at good discounts. Anker makes some of our favorite charging gear and I always end up picking up an accessory or two during Prime Day to ensure I have what I need when I need it most, and I feel better knowing I didn't spend full price on it. For example, in sales past, I picked up a couple of extra USB-C charging cables so I could keep one in my carry-on luggage so I always have one when I travel. My partner will likely be upgrading to an iPhone 17 this year, so we'll have to get a few more USB-C cables now that Lightning is officially banished from our home. Also, every year it seems I need yet another surge protector, so even though I picked one up the year before — but one can never have too many. Here, we've collected all of the best October Prime Day deals on Anker devices and other charging gear we could find, and we'll update this post as the event goes on with the latest offerings. Anker Prime Day deals: Power banks Power banks are not as straightforward as you might think. They come in all shapes, sizes and capacities and can have extra features like magnetic alignment, built-in kickstands, extra ports and more. It's worth considering how you'll use a power bank before you decide on the right one to buy. Smartphones don’t need huge-capacity bricks to power up a couple of times over; a 5K or 10K portable charger should be plenty if that’s all you’re looking to support. If you want a more versatile accessory that can charge a tablet, laptop or gaming handheld, consider a brick with a higher capacity — and more ports so you can charge multiple devices simultaneously. Anker Prime Day deals: Wireless chargers A good wireless charger can lighten your cable load. While wired charging remains faster and more efficient, wireless chargers can clean up your space by eliminating a few of those cables that constantly trip you up. We recommend thinking about where you'll use a wireless charger before buying one. Those outfitting a home office with new tech may want a wireless charging stand that puts their phone in an upright position that’s easier to see while it’s powering up, while those who want a wireless charger for their nightstand might prefer a lay-flat design or a power station that can charge a smartphone, smartwatch and pair of earbuds all at once. Anker Prime Day deals: Charging gear Plenty of other charging gear is on sale for Prime Day. It’s never a bad idea to pick up a few 30W USB-C adapters so you always have what you need to reliably power up your phone. Same goes for extra USB-C (or USB-A) cables that can live in your car, in your office at work or by the couch.

          "standfirst": "Amazon Prime Day is officially here and there are deals running on everything from electronics to kitchen appliances. The latter includes a sale on Ninja's DZ302 10-quart Air Fryer with Dual Baskets, dropping its price from $230 to $160. The 30 percent discount brings the air fryer's price to just $10 more than its all-time low. The 10-quart Ninja DZ302 Air Fryer is a great investment for a lot of reasons, starting with its six settings. You can use it to air fry, air broil, bake, dehydrate, keep things warm and roast your food. Even better? It has two five-quart baskets that allow you to cook two different foods at two different settings. Also, despite it's capabilities, at under 15 inches, it doesn't take up too much counter top real estate (though it's probably too large for the smallest kitchens). The air fryer also comes with Ninja's Smart Finish feature, which ensures your two foods finish cooking at the same time. Plus, there's the Match Cook option which sets both baskets to the same instructions for when you're cooking one thing across both. Those two features are the main difference between the Ninja DZ302 and the 10-quart Ninja DZ401 Foodi — our pick for best dual-zone air fryer. But, otherwise, the latter will give you a very similar device for $130.

The 27 percent discount a new low for the power bank and available in the black and white models. It's just about a third of an inch thick and attaches right to your iPhone. On that note, it works with any MagSafe compatible phone with a magnetic case. Anker's Nano 5K MagGo Slim is our pick for best, well, slim MagSafe power bank. It took two and a half hours to charge an iPhone 15 from 5 percent to 90 percent. However, it could boost the battery to 40 percent in just under an hour.

The deal is available for both the black and white colorways. We reviewed the Era 100 and came away impressed, saying that it provides \"affordable multi-room audio that actually sounds good.\" This model replaced the Sonos One speaker and it's an improvement on that design in every major way. The sound quality is great and it gets plenty loud for get-togethers and the like. The design is simple and attractive and there's both Bluetooth and line-in support. It includes built-in mics for Trueplay tuning and works with just about every music streaming service. It's a good little speaker. While it's easy to recommend this unit, there are a couple of little caveats. It doesn't offer voice support for Google Assistant, though it does integrate with Alexa and the company's proprietary voice assistant. Also, this is a single speaker so there's no real stereo separation. The company is also discounting the Beam 2 soundbar from $463 all the way down to $370. That's a savings of nearly $100.

          "standfirst": "While you can often find discounts on Echo speakers, Fire tablets, Kindles and other Amazon devices throughout the year, Amazon Prime Day is the best time to buy them, period. Prime Day is basically Black Friday for all Amazon-made gear, provided you’re a Prime member who can actually participate in the members-only shopping event. In recent years, October Prime Day discounts on these gadgets have been the same or even better than those we’ve seen during the holiday shopping season. For October Prime Day 2025, you’ll find most of Amazon’s devices on sale for record-low prices (or close to them). These are the best October Prime Day deals you can get on Kindles, Fire TVs, Echos and more. Prime Day Kindle deals Kindle Kids for $95 ($35 off): This is the same device as the base Kindle, but it becomes more kid-friendly thanks to the included cover, two-year warranty and the included year of Amazon Kids+, which gives children ages 3-12 access to hundreds of appropriate ebooks and audiobooks. Just be sure to take note when you activate that subscription because it will renew after one year at the standard $6/month rate. Kindle Paperwhite for $125 ($35 off): The latest version of the Paperwhite has a seven-inch display, thinner bezels, an adjustable warm light, speedier page turns and a battery that can last up to 12 weeks on a single charge. This model is also IPX8 waterproof and has built-in Audible integration. Kindle Colorsoft for $200 ($50 off): Amazon's only color e-reader has a seven-inch, high-contrast display, an auto-adjusting front light, a color highlighting feature and an eight-week battery life. Kindle Scribe for $300 ($100 off): The Scribe is one of the best E-Ink tablets you can buy at the moment, and certainly the top pick if you want a writable table that also excels as an ereader. It provides a great reading and writing experience, thanks in part to its ability to access the entire Kindle ebook library, and it has handy Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox integration. Prime Day Echo deals Echo Pop speaker for $25 (38 percent off): One of the newer Echo devices available, the Pop it sports a 1.95-inch front-facing speaker and a physical mic mute switch for extra privacy. The Pop also has built-in eero compatibility, so it can extend the area of your home Wi-Fi network if you already have an eero router system. Echo Dot speaker for $35 (30 percent off): One of the smallest Echo speakers, this version of the Dot has improved audio and a compact design that will fit almost anywhere. You'll control it mostly with Alexa voice commands, but there are a few onboard buttons, including a mic-off button for when you need more privacy. Echo Show 5 for $55 (39 percent off): This model is one of our favorite smart displays thanks to its compact design, ambient light sensor and sunrise alarm feature, all of which make it an excellent smart alarm clock. Amazon improved the speaker quality on this latest model, which gives sound deeper bass and clearer vocals. Echo Show 8 for $100 (33 percent off): This is our current top pick for the best smart display with Amazon’s Alexa thanks in part to its 8-inch touchscreen, 13MP camera that supports auto-framing for better video chats and its built-in Zigbee smart home hub. The 2023 model supports Visual ID, which will show personalized information on the device’s display depending on who’s using it, and video streaming from Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video and other services. Prime Day Fire TV deals Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 (50 percent off): This is the cheapest Fire TV Stick you can get to stream 4K content, plus it has support for Wi-Fi 6 and Dolby Vision and Atmos. With its live picture-in-picture feature, you can view security camera feeds right on your TV while you’re watching your favorite show or movie. Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 (33 percent off): In addition to 4K HDR streaming with Dolby Vision and Atmos support, the 4K Max dongle includes Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, 16GB of built-in storage and live picture-in-picture capabilities. It also supports the Fire TV “ambient experience,” which lets you display photos and images on your TV screen when you’re not actively watching something. Fire TV Cube streaming box for $100 (29 percent off): This model will provide the best performance of any Fire TV streaming device, and it supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and an enhanced version of the Alexa Voice Remote. Along with live picture-in-picture view and the Fire TV ambient experience, you can also hardware other devices to the Fire TV Cube including a cable box or a game console. Prime Day Fire tablet deals Fire HD 8 tablet for $55 (45 percent off): This is Amazon's most bare-bones tablet, featuring an eight-inch HD touchscreen, hexa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life. The improvements in the screen quality alone from the old-school Fire 7 tablet make it a better buy for most people, and this slab would make a good couch device for general web browsing, email checking, online shopping and more. Fire Max 11 tablet for $140 (39 percent off): Amazon’s most powerful tablet, the Fire Max 11 sports an 11-inch 2,000 x 1,200 touchscreen, an octa-core processor, up to 128GB of storage and 14 hours of battery life. It also works with a number of optional accessories, including a stylus and keyboard case. Fire HD 10 Kids tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This slab is designed for kids aged three to seven, with full parental controls plus one year of Amazon Kids+ for free with the tablet purchase. This model has a 10-inch FHD touchscreen, an octa-core processor and 13 hours of battery life, plus it comes with a two-year warranty and a protective case. Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet for $105 (45 percent off): This model is designed for kids aged six to 12 and comes with a slimmer protective case, a two-year warranty and one year of access to Amazon Kids+. Otherwise, you get a very similar experience here that you would with the non-Pro version, including parental controls, a 10-inch touchscreen, solid performance and a 13-hour battery life.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-deals-on-kindles-echo-speakers-fire-tv-devices-and-more-for-prime-day-081210730.html?src=rss",

          "title": "The best October Prime Day gaming deals: Save on PS5 games, headsets, controllers and more",
          "standfirst": "Among the many tech discounts included in Amazon’s latest October Prime Day sale are a few worthwhile price drops on video games, consoles and other gaming gear. We’ve rounded up the best gaming deals we could find from the event below, and we’ll update this post as we find more discounts of note. Just remember that some of the offers are exclusive to Prime subscribers, and the sale itself officially runs October 7-8. Split Fiction (Xbox) for $25 ($25 off): A pick from our guide to the best couch co-op games, Split Fiction is a imaginative crowd-pleaser that’s designed from the ground up to be played with another person. As in, you literally need a second person to play it. Like It Takes Two before it, it overcomes some hacky writing with brisk action, a lighthearted tone and a Nintendo-like commitment to presenting new methods of play. This deal for the Xbox copy represents the lowest price we’ve tracked, though the PS5 version is also on sale if you’d rather play there. Elden Ring (PS5) for $30 ($20 off): You’ve probably heard about it by now, but the action-RPG Elden Ring is both challenging and darkly funny, with a world that runs incredibly deep and feels lived-in a way few games have. It’s unafraid to test your resolve, yet it always grants you the freedom to simply turn around and find another path forward. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (PS5) for $35 ($15 off): Engadget’s Mat Smith gave this grandiose action-RPG a favorable review last year. You need to have played its predecessor — and ideally, the original PS1 game — to get the most out of it, but it’s positively stuffed with things to do, and its combat system is still a tactical rush at its best. Gran Turismo 7 for $30 ($40 off): Gran Turismo 7 is the PS5’s premier sim racer, and a love letter to automobiles as a whole. Like the rest of the GT series, it revels in the patience and precision required to figure out how a given car meshes with a given course. Learning the intricacies of each combination is both intense and rewarding, and there’s a singular style to it all that just doesn’t exist with most sports games. Returnal for $30 ($70 off): Returnal is a third-person shooter roguelike that’s at once a technical showcase, a stiff challenge and an achingly beautiful reflection on the nature of grief. It is not for the faint of heart, but its bullet-hell battles are wonderfully fierce, and just about everything in it contributes to its overarching story. It’s also worth checking out if you’re eager to developer Housemarque’s next game, Saros, which seems to borrow many of the elements introduced here. The Last of Us Part I for $30 ($40 off): The PS5 remake of Sony’s zombie drama is one of the most unnecessary remakes ever made, but if you’ve never played one of the earlier versions, this is the best way to rectify that. If you’re looking to play the (even moodier) sequel, the PS5 version of that one is similarly discounted. God of War Ragnarok for $30 ($40 off): Ragnarok is another Sony sequel that’s more about increasing scope than radically reinventing itself, but its Norse world is beautifully varied and detailed, smashing baddies with a magic axe feels great, and the whole thing is excessive in the way you’d expect a God of War game to be without going overboard. Horizon Forbidden West for $30 ($40 off): Engadget’s Jess Conditt called Horizon Forbidden West the “total package” in her review a few years back, praising its frenzied combat, gorgeous art direction and complex narrative. It still has one of the more distinctive post-apocalypses in gaming, blending robot beasts with stunning vistas. That helps paper over some less-than-inspired side content and bits of sluggish pacing. Final Fantasy XVI (PS5) for $23 ($7 off): Final Fantasy XVI is a more straightforward action-RPG than something like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth: You don’t need to come in with prior knowledge of any other story, and its hack-and-slash combat is simple to pick up. It can get bogged down in pointless side quests, but its main concern is having you watch giant demigods melodramatically smack each other, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Astro A50 X gaming headset for $330 ($60 off): The A50 X is an upgrade pick in our guide to the best gaming headsets. It should specifically appeal to those who own multiple gaming systems, as its included base station lets you connect and swap between PC, PS5 and Xbox audio with the press of a button. It’s among the better-sounding wireless headsets we’ve tried as well, and its mic is fantastic. This deal isn’t an all-time low, but it’s the largest drop we’ve seen since July. The standard Astro A50 is also on sale for $250; that one works just as well if you only play on one device, but it lacks HDMI switching functionality. 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller for $50 ($10 off): The Ultimate 2 is a versatile wireless gamepad for Windows PCs and mobile devices. It can connect over Bluetooth, a wireless dongle or a USB cable, and its magnetic TMR joysticks should be far less susceptible to “joystick drift” than typical controllers. Those with large hands may find it a touch too small, but it’s built well, it comes with a handy charging dock and it gets a solid 20 or so hours of battery life. 8BitDo’s companion software includes a variety of useful customizations beyond that. This isn’t a major discount, but it’s still a couple bucks below the pad’s typical street price. Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite MMO gaming mouse for $55 ($25 off): We recommend the Scimitar RGB Elite to MMO and MOBA players in our guide to the best gaming mice. It’s not the lightest or most technically advanced model, but it comes with 12 comfortable and easy-to-reach side buttons, which make it easier to pull off more complex actions in games like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy XIV. We’ve seen it fall below $50 a few times before, but this deal matches the lowest price we’ve tracked since May. A newer wireless model called the Scimitar Elite Wireless SE is also on sale for a low of $80. ASUS ROG Strix Scope II 96 Wireless mechanical keyboard for $151 ($59 off): We speak positively about this model in our guide to the best gaming keyboards. Its sturdy case, crisp keycaps and battery life all impress, while the thocky NX Snow switches in this model feel and sound delightful. Its companion software is a bit of a mess, and its 96 percent layout may feel a little cramped to some, but it’s a nice buy if you want a higher-class pre-built keyboard. ASUS ROG Azoth mechanical keyboard for $190 ($85 off): It’s a couple years old at this point, but the ROG Azoth remains an exceptionally well-built mechanical keyboard for enthusiasts. Its gasket-mounted design and layers of foam give each key press a soft landing, while its pre-lubed switches feel nice and smooth. It even comes with a toolkit for manually lubing the switches down the road, and the PCB is hot-swappable if you ever want to switch things up. There’s a useful control knob and programmable OLED display for quickly adjusting settings and checking the battery level beyond that. ASUS’ Armoury Crate software is still fairly sloppy, however. Crucial X9 Pro (1TB) portable SSD for $75 ($26 off): If you’re looking to offload some games to external storage, we consider the Crucial X9 Pro the best portable SSD for most people, as it offers fast enough transfer speeds in a rugged and compact design. This isn’t the best price ever for the 1TB model but it matches the largest discount we’ve seen since April. Other size options are also on sale. Crucial P310 (1TB) M.2 2230 SSD for $80 ($55 off): The P310 is a small-size SSD you can use to add storage to a handheld PC like the Steam Deck or ASUS ROG Ally. It uses cheaper QLC memory, not the faster and more durable TLC, but reviews say that it performs well anyway. This deal ties the best price we’ve seen for the 1TB version since April.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-october-prime-day-gaming-deals-save-on-ps5-games-headsets-controllers-and-more-082623558.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "You don’t have to spend a lot of money to take part in Amazon’s latest Prime Day Sale. Everything listed here is currently going for less than $25 and includes tech like speakers, mice, smart plugs, cables, wall adapters and power banks that fall below that price point. And these aren’t just any products with a pulse — we pulled these from Engadget’s buying guides, gift recommendations and reviews so it’s all stuff we’ve tested and currently recommend. Prime Day has always been a good time to stock up on small essentials, and this time around is no different. Here are the best tech deals for Prime Day that cost less than $25. The best Prime Day deals under $25 Blink Mini 2 security camera for $20 ($20 off): This is the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (128GB) for $13 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. The larger-capacity 256GB model is on sale for $23, but the 128GB is a better gigs-to-dollars deal. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $19 ($16 off): Here’s what we named the best budget streaming stick. At a price this low and only an HD resolution, you shouldn’t expect a premium picture, but if you just want a quick way to get your streaming apps up and running on a basic screen, this will do the thing. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS that we liked in our guide with this device. The best thing about Roku devices is the access to all the free content — and this is an affordable way to get it. Ring Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events. Echo Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year. JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 ($12 off): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours.

          "standfirst": "Anker has a bunch of new Prime charging devices available and some of them are already getting solid discounts. The lineup includes a laptop-compatible Prime Power Bank (26,250mAh, 300W). Prime members can currently get $60 off the portable battery, bringing it down to $170. This portable charger delivers a whopping 300W of total output between its two USB-C ports and single USB-A port. Anker says that, thanks to its 140W output (and if you're using a 5A cable), you can top up the battery of an M4 Pro MacBook Pro to 50 percent in 27 minutes and an iPhone 17 Pro Max to 50 percent in 22 minutes. You can keep tabs on what's happening on each port using the display. This is also the first Anker power bank that supports up to 250W of input recharging by using both USB-C ports simultaneously. This faster charging can top up the powerbank's own battery to 50 percent in just 13 minutes, according to Anker. This model has a capacity of 26,250mAh (99.75Wh), which is very close to the FAA's limit of 100W. It's TSA-approved, so you'll be able to take it on flights. It's capable of taking an M4 MacBook Pro from fully dead to an 80 percent charge. The power bank weighs 1.3 lbs — the same as about three iPhones, Anker says. Other Anker Prime devices are on sale too. A new 3-in-1 MagSafe charger — which can top up the batteries of your iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods with wireless charging case simultaneously — also has a $58 discount to $172 . While there are certainly less expensive 3-in-1 MagSafe options out there, this one includes Qi2 25W support for faster charging, as well as TEC active cooling. Anker suggests this can help speed up charging times and help guard against iPhone battery degradation over time. A three-port GaN Prime Charger that plugs into an outlet is $40 off too, now down to $110. Anker says it's as compact as an AirPods Pro 3 case and can provide a total output of 160W, with up to 140W via a single USB-C cable. The charger is said to offer smart power distribution, and you can monitor what's happening and adjust modes via an onboard display and controls.

But deciphering what constitutes a “good deal” on a laptop during Prime Day can be a bit challenging. That’s due in part to the manic nature of laptop prices on Amazon in particular: they fluctuate often depending on model, brand, configuration, seller and more. But Engadget can help by collecting all of the best October Prime Day laptop deals here so you don’t have to go searching for them. Best Prime Day laptop deals: MacBooks Apple’s latest laptops are the MacBook Air M4 and the MacBook Pro M4, and we recommend getting those if you want a device that’s as future-proof as possible at the moment. You’ll find decent MacBook deals on Amazon throughout the year, and most of them will be on the base configurations. In a welcomed update earlier this year, Apple recently made all base models of the MacBook Air M4 have 16GB of RAM by default (which is the same as you’ll find on the base-level Pros). Apple MacBook Air (15-inch, M4) for $999 (17 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch, M4) for $1,399 (13 percent off) Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, M4) for $2,249 (10 percent off) Best Prime day laptop deals: Windows laptops You’ve got a lot of variety to choose from when it comes to Windows laptops, and that can be a blessing or a curse. We recommend looking for a laptop from a reputable brand (i.e. Microsoft, Dell, Acer, Lenovo and others like them), and one that can handle daily work or play pressures. That means at least 16GB of RAM and 245GB of SSD storage, plus the latest Intel or AMD CPUs. If you’re looking for a new gaming laptop, you’ll need a bit more power and a dedicated graphics card to boot. HP Ultrabook 14 (14-inch, Intel N100) for $280 (20 percent off) Lenovo IdeaPad 1i (Windows 11, 15-inch, Intel Celeron) for $280 (30 percent off) Dell 15 3530 laptop (Windows 11 Pro, 15-inch, Intel Core i5) for $659 (27 percent off) Best Prime Day laptop deals: Chromebooks Most Chromebooks are already pretty cheap, but that just means you can get them for even less during an event like Prime Day. However, there are a ton of premium Chromebooks available today that didn’t exist even three years ago, so now is a great time to look out for discounts on those models. In general, we recommend looking for at least 4 to 8GB of RAM and at least 128GB of SDD storage in a Chromebook that you plan on using as your daily driver.

          "standfirst": "If you prefer open-ear AirPods but still have an older model, this deal could be worth noting. Amazon's October Prime Day has the AirPods 4 on sale for $90, or 30 percent off their usual price. That's also the lowest we've seen them. When Apple updated its standard AirPods in 2024, it released two models: one with active noise cancellation (ANC) and one without. We consider the non-ANC models to be the best budget AirPods you can get, so they're an even better buy at this sale price. The ANC versions are also discounted at the moment, so you can pick them up for $120 instead of the usual $180. The AirPods' H2 chip brings a bunch of Pro-adjacent features to the standard model. That list includes Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, Transparency, Personalized Spatial Audio and wireless charging. For calls, it supports Voice Isolation, which helps filter out background noise and make it easier for you to be heard. And if that call is via FaceTime, it supports Apple's 48kHz \"cinema-quality\" audio. Sound is improved over the AirPods 3. \"There's more low-end tone than the previous model right out of the gate, and the punchier treble opens the sound stage so it's wider and more immersive,\" Engadget's Billy Steele wrote. \"The improved frequency response is on full display with Dolby Atmos content (movies, music, and TV), but the AirPods 4 are also more sonically adept with non-spatial tunes and video.\" You can expect around five hours of battery life on a single charge. With the ANC model, that estimate drops to around four hours with the marquee feature activated. With either version, you can drop them in the charging case to extend their total time to around 30 hours. And hey, it's good to give your ears a rest now and then anyway.

IBM&#x27;s announcements represent a three-pronged strategy to address interconnected enterprise AI challenges: modernizing legacy code, governing AI agents in production and bridging the prototype-to-production gap..The company claims 6,000 internal developers within IBM have used Project Bob, achieving an average productivity gain of 45% and a 22-43% increase in code commits .Project Bob isn&#x27;t another vibe coder, it&#x27;s an enterprise modernization toolThere is no shortage of AI-powered coding tools in the market today, including tools like GitHub Copilot and vibe coding tools such as Replit, Cursor, Bolt and Lovable.\"Project Bob takes a fundamentally different approach from tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor,\" Bruno Aziza, IBM&#x27;s Vice President of Data, AI and Analytics Strategy told VentureBeat.Aziza said that Project Bob is enterprise-focused and maintains full-repository context across editing sessions. It automates complex tasks like Java 8 to more modern version of Java and framework upgrades from Struts or JSF to React, Angular or Liberty.The architecture orchestrates between Anthropic&#x27;s Claude, Mistral, Meta&#x27;s Llama and IBM&#x27;s recently released Granite 4 models through a data-driven model selection approach. The system routes tasks to whichever LLM is best suited, balancing accuracy, latency and cost in real time.\"It understands the entire repository, development intent and security standards, enabling developers to design, debug, refactor and modernize code without breaking flow,” he said.Among 6,000 early adopters within IBM, 95% used Bob for task completion rather than code generation. The tool integrates DevSecOps practices like vulnerability detection and compliance checks directly into the IDE.\"Bob goes beyond code assistance — it orchestrates intelligence across the entire software development lifecycle, helping teams ship secure, modern software faster,\" he said.Project Bob benefits from new Anthropic partnershipPart of Project Bob is a new partnership between IBM and AnthropicThe two vendors announced a partnership to integrate Claude models directly into the watsonx portfolio, starting with Project Bob. The collaboration extends beyond model integration to include what IBM describes as a first-of-its-kind guide for enterprise AI agent deployment.IBM and Anthropic co-created \"A Guide to Architecting Secure Enterprise AI Agents with MCP Servers,\" focused on the Agent Development Lifecycle (ADLC). The ADLC framework provides a structured approach to designing, deploying and managing enterprise AI systems. MCP refers to Model Context Protocol, Anthropic&#x27;s widely embraced open standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems and data they need to work with.Making it easier to build enterprise-grade AI agentsIn addition to Project Bob, IBM announced that it is extending its watsonx Orchestrate technology to integrate the open source Langflow visual agent builder. Langflow is an open-source technology that is led by DataStax, which itself was acquired by IBM in May of this year. The integration of Langflow is intended to address what Aziza calls the \"prototype to production chasm.\"\"Today, there&#x27;s no seamless path from open-source prototyping to enterprise-grade systems that are reliable, compliant and scalable,\" Aziza said. \"Watsonx Orchestrate transforms Langflow-like agentic composition into an enterprise-grade orchestration platform by adding governance, security, scalability, compliance, and operational robustness — making it production-ready for mission-critical use.” Aziza explained that the integration of Langflow with watsonx Orchestration brings critical capabilities on top of the open-source tool including:Agent lifecycle framework: Provisioning, versioning, deployment and monitoring with multi-agent coordination and role-based access.Integrated AI governance: Embedded watsonx.governance provides audit trails, explainability for agent decisions, bias and drift monitoring and policy enforcement. Langflow has no native governance controls.Enterprise infrastructure: SaaS or on-premises hosting with data isolation, SSO/LDAP integration and fine-grained permissions. Langflow users must manage their own infrastructure and security.No-code and pro-code options: Langflow is \"low-code.\" IBM added a visual, no-code Agent Builder and a pro-code Agent Development Kit for seamless promotion from prototype to production.Pre-built domain agents: Catalog of HR, IT and finance agents integrated with Workday, SAP and ServiceNow.Production observability: Built-in dashboards, analytics and enterprise support SLAs with continuous performance monitoring.AgentOps and Agentic Workflows: From building to governingIBM is also introducing two new capabilities to watsonx Orchestrate that work in tandem with the Langflow integration: Agentic Workflows for standardized agent coordination and AgentOps for production governance. Agentic Workflows addresses what Aziza calls the \"brittle scripts\" problem. Today developers build agents using custom scripts that break when scaled across enterprise environments. Agentic Workflows provides standardized, reusable flows that sequence multiple agents and tools consistently. This connects directly to the Langflow integration. While Langflow provides the visual interface for building individual agents, Agentic Workflows handles the orchestration layer, coordinating multiple agents and tools into repeatable enterprise processes. AgentOps then provides the governance and observability for those running workflows. The new built-in observability layer provides real-time monitoring and policy-based controls across the full agent lifecycle.The governance gap becomes concrete in enterprise scenarios. Without AgentOps, an HR onboarding agent might set up benefits and payroll but teams lack visibility into whether it&#x27;s applying policies correctly until problems surface. With AgentOps, every action is monitored in real time, allowing anomalies to be flagged and corrected immediately.What this means for enterprisesTechnical debt is something that many organizations struggle with and it can represent a non-trivial barrier for organizations looking to get into agentic AI deployments. Project Bob&#x27;s value proposition is clearest for organizations with significant legacy Java codebases. The 45% productivity gains IBM measured internally suggest meaningful acceleration for Java 8 to more modern versions of Java and framework upgrades from Struts or JSF to modern architectures. However, these metrics come from IBM developers working on IBM systems. The critical unknown is whether the multi-model orchestration delivers the same results on customer codebases with different architectural patterns, technical debt profiles and team skill levels.The Langflow integration addresses a genuine gap for teams already using open source agent frameworks. The challenge isn&#x27;t building agents with tools like LangChain, LangGraph or n8n. It&#x27;s adding the governance layer, lifecycle management, enterprise security controls and observability required for production deployment.For enterprises looking to lead in AI adoption, IBM&#x27;s announcements serve to reinforce the fact that governance infrastructure is now table stakes. You can build agents quickly with existing tools. Scaling them safely requires the lifecycle management, observability and policy controls.Project Bob is now available in private tech preview with broader availability expected in the future. IBM is accepting access requests through its developer portal. Its AgentOps and agentic workflows integrations are now available in watsonx Orchestrate, while its Langflow integration is expected to be generally available at the end of this month.",

          "title": "The best Prime Day speaker deals: JBL, Bose, Ultimate Ears and more",
          "standfirst": "We're always ready to argue that high-quality speakers are a worthwhile investment, adding new dimensions to music and dialogue that make any kind of entertainment more enjoyable. That said, they're not exactly cheap. That's why our staff audiophiles get so excited whenever Prime Day rolls around — it's an ideal time to sift through Amazon for bargains on the best smart speakers, soundbars and portable bluetooth speakers. This October Prime Day, our list of the best deals includes brands like Anker, Bose, JBL, Amazon Echo and more. So if you're ready to hear when your favorite TV actors are scratching themselves, let's get started. Best Prime Day bluetooth speaker deals JBL Xtreme 3 for $209 (36 percent off): Like the Xtreme 2, the JBL Xtreme 3 is a hefty bluetooth speaker with a 15-hour battery life and the ability to chain together with other JBL speakers. But don't fret if you've only got one — even on its own, we've found the Xtreme 3's 100-watt output manages to sound both crisp and deep in any space. JBL Flip 6 for $100 (23 percent off): The JBL Flip 6 is a solid choice for an all-around bluetooth speaker, performing well in any room or on the go. It sounds good at almost any frequency and volume, runs for 12 hours on a single charge and is nearly impossible to damage with falls, dust or water. JBL Go 3 for $25 (37 percent off): The JBL Go 3 is a decent and highly affordable carabiner speaker for all your outdoor adventures — as is its sister product, the Go 3 Eco, which is made from recycled materials. It's obviously not the most powerful speaker at 4.2 watts, but it has a surprisingly good functional range. Plus, the design looks good on any belt or backpack. Ultimate Ears Miniroll for $50 (37 percent off): Miniroll is the smallest speaker from Ultimate Ears, but it punches far above its weight, starting with UE's trademark massive volume buttons. While small enough to fit in a jeans pocket, its combination of a driver and radiator manages about 85 decibels. A Miniroll can run for about 12 hours on a single charge. Ultimate Ears Boom 4 for $100 (33 percent off): The UE Boom 4 is a balanced speaker that does well anywhere. Take it camping (it's waterproof and a charge lasts for 15 hours), to a party (it puts out loud 360 degree sound) or make it part of a permanent home system by chaining it with other UE speakers — one of these plus two Minirolls or Wonderbooms would come pretty close to full surround sound. Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 for $70 (30 percent off): The Wonderboom 4 may be our favorite UE product. At just 1.2 pounds, it can pump out mighty sound on its own, or chain with other UE speakers for a deeper full-range experience. USB charging is simple and lasts for 14 hours between top-ups. Ultimate Ears Everboom for $231 (15 percent off): The Everboom is the middle ground of the UE line, with more powerful output than the Wonderboom and more portability than the Hyperboom. Its 360 degree sound pairs with an Outdoor Boost feature to work better outside, though it isn't quite as impressive in the middle ranges. Bose SoundLink Flex for $99 (33 percent off): We've rarely seen the Bose SoundLink Flex this cheap, so now is the time to snap up this high-fidelity outdoor speaker. It's small enough to carry in one hand and can be operated from up to 30 feet away via the Bose Connect app. We've also found it simple and fun to use for hands-free phone calls during breaks in the music. Bose SoundLink Revolve+ for $179 (40 percent off): The SoundLink Revolve+ line, Bose's original upright 360-degree speakers, continue to pack a punch. This current model features a 17-hour battery life, IP55 water resistance and the ability to connect to a smart speaker to extend your virtual assistant's range. Bose SoundLink Max for $299 (25 percent off): The Bose SoundLink Max may put you in mind of a classic boombox, with its detachable handle and thudding base. But inside it's all modern, with a 50-watt output, an effective range of 52.6Hz and a 20-hour rechargeable battery. It even comes with a 3.5mm AUX input to connect to a turntable, if you really want to embrace your inner 90s DJ. Beats Pill for $100 (33 percent off): We gave the revived Beats Pill a full review last year, and we stand by our opinion that it was worth waiting for. Its newly enlarged subwoofer delivers much more powerful bass that sounds clean and lossless even over USB-C. The latest Pill also travels well, with 24 hours of battery life and IP67 waterproofing. Marshall Emberton II for $100 (44 percent off): Marshall, the old warhorse of the audio world, continues to crush it with the portable and bluetooth-ready Emberton II. Although it looks like an antique, it's anything but, with 360-degree sound and over 30 hours of battery life from a single charge — all weighing a little more than a quarter of a pound. Best Prime Day smart speaker deals Amazon Echo Dot 5th Generation for $35 (30 percent off): The Echo Dot, our favorite smart speaker under $50, is now...even farther under $50. Despite being small enough to fit on a cluttered bookshelf, the Dot pumps out high-quality sound that can fill a room, and comes equipped with physical buttons to supplement Alexa's voice command interface. Amazon Echo Pop for $25 (38 percent off): The Echo Pop is Amazon's smallest and cheapest smart speaker, resembling an Echo Dot sliced in half. It's a little quiet, and probably best for extending Alexa's range rather than serving as the primary host for your virtual assistant. In a smaller room, though, this is as convenient and clear-sounding as any other Echo you'll use. Best Prime Day soundbar deals JBL Bar 9.1 for $700 (41 percent off): JBL designed the 9.1 soundbar for Dolby Atmos, and the results speak for themselves, with 820 watts of booming audio. The best thing about this soundbar is the pair of detachable wireless speakers you can place around your viewing room to make the sound even more surround. JBL Bar 300 for $250 (37 percent off): The Bar 300, part of JBL's 2023 soundbar explosion, is a mighty yet cheap soundbar with an integrated subwoofer. Despite being small, it manages to create a theatrical experience by working both Dolby Atmos and MultiBeam. Its voice sharpening algorithm is especially good at making dialogue clearer (for those of us who always have to put on the subtitles). JBL Bar 700 for $500 (44 percent off): Another 2023 drop, the JBL Bar 700 upgrades the Bar 300 by adding detachable wireless speakers for true 360-degree sound. While it costs twice as much as the 300, that money gets you more than four times the output, as the 700 tops out at 620 watts — and thanks to a 10-inch subwoofer, you'll feel all of it. Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus for $150 (40 percent off): One of the cheapest soundbars you'll ever see, the Fire TV Soundbar Plus provides a noticeable boost to your TV's audio quality, even if it doesn't reach Dolby Atmos heights. It's simple, but that makes it a breeze to set up — all you have to do is plug in one HDMI cable.

          "content": "We're always ready to argue that high-quality speakers are a worthwhile investment, adding new dimensions to music and dialogue that make any kind of entertainment more enjoyable. That said, they're not exactly cheap. That's why our staff audiophiles get so excited whenever Prime Day rolls around — it's an ideal time to sift through Amazon for bargains on the best smart speakers, soundbars and portable bluetooth speakers. This October Prime Day, our list of the best deals includes brands like Anker, Bose, JBL, Amazon Echo and more. So if you're ready to hear when your favorite TV actors are scratching themselves, let's get started. Best Prime Day bluetooth speaker deals JBL Xtreme 3 for $209 (36 percent off): Like the Xtreme 2, the JBL Xtreme 3 is a hefty bluetooth speaker with a 15-hour battery life and the ability to chain together with other JBL speakers. But don't fret if you've only got one — even on its own, we've found the Xtreme 3's 100-watt output manages to sound both crisp and deep in any space. JBL Flip 6 for $100 (23 percent off): The JBL Flip 6 is a solid choice for an all-around bluetooth speaker, performing well in any room or on the go. It sounds good at almost any frequency and volume, runs for 12 hours on a single charge and is nearly impossible to damage with falls, dust or water. JBL Go 3 for $25 (37 percent off): The JBL Go 3 is a decent and highly affordable carabiner speaker for all your outdoor adventures — as is its sister product, the Go 3 Eco, which is made from recycled materials. It's obviously not the most powerful speaker at 4.2 watts, but it has a surprisingly good functional range. Plus, the design looks good on any belt or backpack. Ultimate Ears Miniroll for $50 (37 percent off): Miniroll is the smallest speaker from Ultimate Ears, but it punches far above its weight, starting with UE's trademark massive volume buttons. While small enough to fit in a jeans pocket, its combination of a driver and radiator manages about 85 decibels. A Miniroll can run for about 12 hours on a single charge. Ultimate Ears Boom 4 for $100 (33 percent off): The UE Boom 4 is a balanced speaker that does well anywhere. Take it camping (it's waterproof and a charge lasts for 15 hours), to a party (it puts out loud 360 degree sound) or make it part of a permanent home system by chaining it with other UE speakers — one of these plus two Minirolls or Wonderbooms would come pretty close to full surround sound. Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 for $70 (30 percent off): The Wonderboom 4 may be our favorite UE product. At just 1.2 pounds, it can pump out mighty sound on its own, or chain with other UE speakers for a deeper full-range experience. USB charging is simple and lasts for 14 hours between top-ups. Ultimate Ears Everboom for $231 (15 percent off): The Everboom is the middle ground of the UE line, with more powerful output than the Wonderboom and more portability than the Hyperboom. Its 360 degree sound pairs with an Outdoor Boost feature to work better outside, though it isn't quite as impressive in the middle ranges. Bose SoundLink Flex for $99 (33 percent off): We've rarely seen the Bose SoundLink Flex this cheap, so now is the time to snap up this high-fidelity outdoor speaker. It's small enough to carry in one hand and can be operated from up to 30 feet away via the Bose Connect app. We've also found it simple and fun to use for hands-free phone calls during breaks in the music. Bose SoundLink Revolve+ for $179 (40 percent off): The SoundLink Revolve+ line, Bose's original upright 360-degree speakers, continue to pack a punch. This current model features a 17-hour battery life, IP55 water resistance and the ability to connect to a smart speaker to extend your virtual assistant's range. Bose SoundLink Max for $299 (25 percent off): The Bose SoundLink Max may put you in mind of a classic boombox, with its detachable handle and thudding base. But inside it's all modern, with a 50-watt output, an effective range of 52.6Hz and a 20-hour rechargeable battery. It even comes with a 3.5mm AUX input to connect to a turntable, if you really want to embrace your inner 90s DJ. Beats Pill for $100 (33 percent off): We gave the revived Beats Pill a full review last year, and we stand by our opinion that it was worth waiting for. Its newly enlarged subwoofer delivers much more powerful bass that sounds clean and lossless even over USB-C. The latest Pill also travels well, with 24 hours of battery life and IP67 waterproofing. Marshall Emberton II for $100 (44 percent off): Marshall, the old warhorse of the audio world, continues to crush it with the portable and bluetooth-ready Emberton II. Although it looks like an antique, it's anything but, with 360-degree sound and over 30 hours of battery life from a single charge — all weighing a little more than a quarter of a pound. Best Prime Day smart speaker deals Amazon Echo Dot 5th Generation for $35 (30 percent off): The Echo Dot, our favorite smart speaker under $50, is now...even farther under $50. Despite being small enough to fit on a cluttered bookshelf, the Dot pumps out high-quality sound that can fill a room, and comes equipped with physical buttons to supplement Alexa's voice command interface. Amazon Echo Pop for $25 (38 percent off): The Echo Pop is Amazon's smallest and cheapest smart speaker, resembling an Echo Dot sliced in half. It's a little quiet, and probably best for extending Alexa's range rather than serving as the primary host for your virtual assistant. In a smaller room, though, this is as convenient and clear-sounding as any other Echo you'll use.

          "standfirst": "October Prime Day has Engadget's favorite wireless headphones on sale. You can get Sony's excellent WH-1000XM6 for $20 off. While that's far from the steepest tech discount you'll see this week, it's a record low for this product. (After all, Sony only launched the XM6 in March, so this is still new gear.) You can get them today for $430. The WH-1000XM6 takes a leap forward in sound quality, active noise cancellation (ANC) and other features. Our audio reviewer, Billy Steele, called them the best headphones you can buy right now. \"The crown is safe once again,\" he wrote. \"Sony has managed to overhaul its flagship headphones in all the right ways that keep the 1000X line atop our best headphones list.\" The XM6 has a powerful new chip, the QN3, that unlocks much of its potential. Sony also developed new drivers for this model, resulting in richer details, clearer vocals and a better overall balance. The headphones added four extra microphones to enhance ANC. The XM6 is especially improved at blocking out voices. If you're a fan of spatial effects, which simulate a wider soundstage, Sony added that for this generation. The (optional) 360 Spatial Sound feature transforms regular stereo content into something with a surround-sound effect. It's similar to what Apple and Bose have in their models. It's yet another audio effect option in Sony's app, alongside 360 Reality Audio and DSEE Extreme upscaling. The headphones are no slouch in the battery life department. The XM6 is rated for up to 30 hours with ANC on and up to 40 hours with it off. In Engadget's testing, we had no problem hitting those advertised figures. If you'd rather save more money for a lesser (but still great) pair of cans, Sony's last-gen model is also on sale. You can get the WH-1000XM5 for $100 off. The 2022 flagship headphones offer premium sound, ANC, and battery life. Typically $400, you can get them during October Prime Day for $300.

          "standfirst": "It's frankly amazing how good vacuum cleaners are these days. Once the laughingstock of the gadget world with their dusty bags and tiny wheels, today's vacuums are sleek dirt-destroying machines, capable of rendering a house habitable no matter how many cats live in it. Some of them are even robots that will do the cleaning for you. For October Prime Day, Amazon has steeply cut the prices of some of the best vacuums (and some pretty good ones alongside). Now is a fantastic time to upgrade your cleaner, so check out the list below for our best recommendations. Best Prime Day robot vacuum deals Dyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 (33 percent off): Our top pick for the best cordless vacuum on the market right now, the V15 Detect has some of the strongest suction power you'll find in a stick vacuum, plus a lightweight design and a dustbin that can hold more dirt and debris than it might seem. This model comes with five cleaning attachments, including the Fluffy Optic cleaner head that has LEDs to illuminate the floor as you're vacuuming so you can better see where all the dust bunnies are. Dyson Ball Animal Total Clean Upright Vacuum for $410 (38 percent off): Dyson is still the king of reinventing vacuums, and the bagless, hyper-maneuverable Ball Animal is a blast to use. The Ball design is based on ease of steering, but the hidden MVP is the sealing — from the head to the canister, not a hair is getting out of this one once it's in. Shark AV2501AE AI Robot Vacuum for $600 (8 percent off): If you like the look of the AV2501S but have even more space to clean, the AV2501AE is also on sale. Its self-empty base can go a full 60 days before you have to dump it out, so it's ideal for large spaces, complex homes or areas that see heavy use. It's got the same features otherwise, including LiDAR mapping and two hours of autonomous work. Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch for $450 (55 percent off): This robotic mop/vacuum combo is engineering so you'll almost never need to revisit it after you set it up. It can clean its own mop, refill its own water tank and empty its own dustbin for up to 30 days at a time. It's also equipped with air jets that blast dirt out of corners the vacuum can't fit into. Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 for $300 (57 percent off, Prime exclusive): The Shark Matrix Plus takes the robot vacuum concept even further by working a mop into the design for hands-off wet cleaning. This model is self-cleaning, self-emptying, self-charging and capable of tackling ground-in stains on hard floors. Shark Navigator Lift-Away Deluxe for $160 (27 percent off): Moving into manual vacuums, let's start with one of the best. The Shark Navigator Lift-Away is a champion at getting deeply ingrained crud out of carpets, but it's also capable of squaring away bare floors. You can switch between the two settings quickly, and the lift-away canister makes it easy to empty. iRobot Roomba 104 Vac for $150 (40 percent off, Prime exclusive): This entry-level Roomba is a good pick for anyone who's new to owning a robot vacuum. It features a multi-surface brush and an edge-sweeping brush to clean all types of flooring, and it uses LiDAR navigation to avoid obstacles as it goes. The iRobot mobile app lets you control the robot, set cleaning schedules and more. iRobot Roomba Plus 504 for $380 (36 percent off): For those looking to upgrade to a more advanced robot vacuum, the Roomba Plus 504 is a great next step. It can clean almost anything that might land on a home floor, and if it can't clean it, it can steer around it. Two brushes and strong suction get at tougher stains, and it even includes an app you can use to set cleaning zones and change suction force remotely. Roborock Q10 S5+ Robot Vacuum and Mop for $300 (25 percent off): The Roborock Q10 S5+ is another great option for a vacuum-mop combo. It's skilled at knowing what type of floor it's on and deploying or retracting the mop appropriately, and comes with precision LiDAR mapping. You can change its settings remotely from a paired app. Best Prime Day vacuum deals Levoit LVAC-300 cordless vacuum for $220 (37 percent off, Prime exclusive): One of our favorite cordless vacuums, this Levoit machine has great handling, strong suction power for its price and a premium-feeling design. Its bin isn't too small, it has HEPA filtration and its battery life should be more than enough for you to clean your whole home many times over before it needs a recharge. Shark CarpetXpert HairPro for $280 (24 percent off): Not all vacuums need to reinvent the wheel. The Shark CarpetXpert HairPro is the perfect midrange option, with a large brushroll for getting pet hair and other allergens out of your carpets. It's designed internally to suction and store hair without clogging, making it an even better fit for homes with pets. Amazon Basics Upright Bagless Vacuum Cleaner for $63 (10 percent off): All right, nobody goes to Amazon Basics to be impressed, but we have to admit this vacuum exceeds expectations. It's light, it has a big dust reservoir and it comes with all the attachments you'll need for a reasonably sized apartment. The filter is also simple to remove and clean. Black+Decker QuickClean Cordless Handheld Vacuum for $27 (33 percent off): Rounding out the list, we've got this small-but-mighty hand vacuum, perfect for crevices, shelves or cleaning out your car. It weighs about 1.4 pounds and hoovers up small messes in the blink of an eye. The lithium-ion battery stays charged for up to 10 hours.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-vacuum-deals-save-on-machines-from-irobot-shark-dyson-and-others-151504087.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "A portable storage device can make a world of difference to intensive processing tasks, from running massive video games — which feels like all of them these days — to core operating system functions. A solid-state drive (SSD) gives your hard drive more bandwidth than it comes with by default, making huge chunks of data easier to digest and keeping your device from running too hot. This October Prime Day, we've rounded up the best deals on SSDs, portable SSDs and microSD cards. Not only are these some of the best products in the field, but their prices are lower than they're likely to be for some time. Best October Prime Day SSD deals Crucial X10 4TB Portable SSD for $240 (39 percent off): The Crucial X9 is our current favorite portable SSD, but the X10 is a step beyond. Based on USB 3.2, it's compatible with a wide range of devices, and reaches reading speeds of 2,100MB/s — all in an extremely portable pocket-sized case. Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA 2.5-inch Internal SSD for $70 (26 percent off): The BX500 is Crucial's budget-conscious SSD option, but that doesn't mean it disappoints. This internal solid state drive cuts down on battery consumption and improves processing with read speeds reaching 540MB/s. It comes with a three-year warranty, too. Crucial P310 2TB for $149 (38 percent off): The 2TB level of the Crucial P310 is available at the lowest price we've seen all year. It's a compact drive that works great in small laptops or Steam Decks — especially the latter, given Valve's warning against cramming in large SSDs. For this small size and great price, you get read speeds of over 7,000MB/s. Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB for $60 (43 percent off): This is an incredible deal on an internal SSD from a reliable brand. All capacities of the Samsung 990 Evo Plus are currently on sale, but even the 1TB option can visibly boost your performance with top read speeds of 7,250MB/s. There's no heatsink, but nickel plating on the controller reduces both heat output and energy use. Samsung 990 PRO 2 TB for $140 (33 percent off): Samsung's 990 Pro series represents a massive leap forward for the brand, cutting energy costs by around half while boosting speeds up to at least 7,000MB/s write and 5,000MB/s read. This version comes with 2TB of storage and its own built-in heatsink. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): The Samsung Fit Plus isn't just the best thumb drive on the market right now — it's one of the best SSDs, period. This deal gets you 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s for almost unfathomably cheap. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Kingston SX1000 1TB High Performance for $75 (35 percent off): If you can't swing a Crucial X9 or X10 right now, Kingston offers a much more affordable alternative. The SX1000 can handle both PC backups and gaming storage with ease, nearly matching the X9 in our speed tests. It's also easy to carry around, though keep a tight grip as it's not officially rated for any drop height. SanDisk 2TB Extreme Portable SSD for $150 (29 percent off): The SanDisk Extreme line of portable SSDs provides a great middle ground in both price and performance. Read speeds of 1,050MB/s are enough for transferring most files you'll encounter day-to-day. Its external design holds up too, with a large carabiner loop, IP65 waterproofing and dustproofing and drop protection as high as three meters. Seagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB for $200 (44 percent off): This Seagate SSD is specifically for expanding storage on the Xbox Series X and S, and it's designed to meet Xbox specs exactly. You'll get exactly the same performance booting a game from this card as you would from internal Xbox storage, which makes data management infinitely easier.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-ssd-deals-save-on-gear-from-samsung-sandisk-crucial-and-others-170039457.html?src=rss",
          "content": "A portable storage device can make a world of difference to intensive processing tasks, from running massive video games — which feels like all of them these days — to core operating system functions. A solid-state drive (SSD) gives your hard drive more bandwidth than it comes with by default, making huge chunks of data easier to digest and keeping your device from running too hot. This October Prime Day, we've rounded up the best deals on SSDs, portable SSDs and microSD cards. Not only are these some of the best products in the field, but their prices are lower than they're likely to be for some time. Best October Prime Day SSD deals Crucial X10 4TB Portable SSD for $240 (39 percent off): The Crucial X9 is our current favorite portable SSD, but the X10 is a step beyond. Based on USB 3.2, it's compatible with a wide range of devices, and reaches reading speeds of 2,100MB/s — all in an extremely portable pocket-sized case. Crucial BX500 1TB 3D NAND SATA 2.5-inch Internal SSD for $70 (26 percent off): The BX500 is Crucial's budget-conscious SSD option, but that doesn't mean it disappoints. This internal solid state drive cuts down on battery consumption and improves processing with read speeds reaching 540MB/s. It comes with a three-year warranty, too. Crucial P310 2TB for $149 (38 percent off): The 2TB level of the Crucial P310 is available at the lowest price we've seen all year. It's a compact drive that works great in small laptops or Steam Decks — especially the latter, given Valve's warning against cramming in large SSDs. For this small size and great price, you get read speeds of over 7,000MB/s. Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB for $60 (43 percent off): This is an incredible deal on an internal SSD from a reliable brand. All capacities of the Samsung 990 Evo Plus are currently on sale, but even the 1TB option can visibly boost your performance with top read speeds of 7,250MB/s. There's no heatsink, but nickel plating on the controller reduces both heat output and energy use. Samsung 990 PRO 2 TB for $140 (33 percent off): Samsung's 990 Pro series represents a massive leap forward for the brand, cutting energy costs by around half while boosting speeds up to at least 7,000MB/s write and 5,000MB/s read. This version comes with 2TB of storage and its own built-in heatsink. Samsung Fit Plus 256GB for $23 (30 percent off): The Samsung Fit Plus isn't just the best thumb drive on the market right now — it's one of the best SSDs, period. This deal gets you 256GB of storage and read speeds of 400MB/s for almost unfathomably cheap. It's also built to resist water, extreme temperatures, magnets and even radiation. Kingston SX1000 1TB High Performance for $75 (35 percent off): If you can't swing a Crucial X9 or X10 right now, Kingston offers a much more affordable alternative. The SX1000 can handle both PC backups and gaming storage with ease, nearly matching the X9 in our speed tests. It's also easy to carry around, though keep a tight grip as it's not officially rated for any drop height. SanDisk 2TB Extreme Portable SSD for $150 (29 percent off): The SanDisk Extreme line of portable SSDs provides a great middle ground in both price and performance. Read speeds of 1,050MB/s are enough for transferring most files you'll encounter day-to-day. Its external design holds up too, with a large carabiner loop, IP65 waterproofing and dustproofing and drop protection as high as three meters. Seagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB for $200 (44 percent off): This Seagate SSD is specifically for expanding storage on the Xbox Series X and S, and it's designed to meet Xbox specs exactly. You'll get exactly the same performance booting a game from this card as you would from internal Xbox storage, which makes data management infinitely easier.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-ssd-deals-save-on-gear-from-samsung-sandisk-crucial-and-others-170039457.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Prime Day is usually a good opportunity to snag deals on Amazon's own product lines, and this event is no exception. Amazon is currently offering some noteworthy discounts on its collection of ereaders. The standout is the Kindle Colorsoft, which is on sale for $200. That's a $50 savings on the 16GB model and a record low price for this product. The cost was one of the only real detractions we found in our review of Amazon's long-awaited color screen ereader, which has a bunch of nice features. The warm light of the screen is adjustable so that you can read easily in different lighting conditions, and there are no ads on the lock screen. If you're reading a lot of comics or manga, you'll likely appreciate both the color screen and the Colorsoft's pinch-to-zoom feature. Amazon says the Colorsoft can last up to eight weeks on a single battery charge, and it's waterproof in case you want to bring it to the beach or the pool (or if you just don't want to risk ruining it if you knock over your water bottle). Colorsoft isn't the only Amazon ereader that's on sale for Prime Day. The standard Kindle model is currently available for $85, down from its usual $110 cost. You can also pick up a Kindle Paperwhite for $125, discounted from $160. Both of these options made our ranking of the best ereaders, with the Kindle winning our recommendation for an entry-level option and the Kindle Paperwhite impressing us as the best premium pick.

          "title": "The best Prime Day TV deals: Save on sets from LG, Samsung, TCL and others",
          "standfirst": "Amazon’s newest October Prime Day sale is underway, and a selection of highly-rated TVs from LG, Samsung, Sony and others are discounted for the occasion. If you can’t wait until Black Friday to upgrade, we’re rounding up the best October Prime Day deals on the sets worth your time below. Just keep in mind that Amazon’s event officially runs October 7-8, and you may need to be a Prime member to see some of the discounts. Best Prime Day TV deals TCL QM7K 55-inch Mini-LED TV for $570 ($330 off): If you’re willing to stretch your budget a little further, the TCL QM7K is a fairly comprehensive step up, with noticeably improved contrast, brightness and color volume. It has a 144Hz refresh rate with 288Hz support at 1080p, too, though it’s still limited to two HDMI 2.1 ports. (As with the QM6K, however, neither of those is an eARC port, so hooking up a soundbar won’t block a game console if you have multiple systems.) This is only $1 more than the all-time low for the 55-inch model. Other sizes are similarly discounted. Hisense U8QG 65-inch Mini-LED TV for $998 ($500 off): Several reviews suggest that the Hisense U8QG ticks most of the requisite boxes for a LCD TV in 2025: robust local dimming and mini-LED backlighting, exceptionally high brightness, vibrant quantum-dot colors, a fast refresh rate (165Hz in this case), support for the major HDR formats and so on. It’s a higher-end option than something like the TCL QM6K or QM7K with superior brightness and contrast, though it still falls short of a good OLED TV when it comes to the latter. Like most LCD panels, it’ll also look a bit washed out if you view it from an angle. It has three HDMI 2.1 ports, which is one fewer than many other TVs in this price range, though it uniquely includes a USB-C video input if you want to hook up a gaming laptop or Nintendo Switch. (Just note that you won’t get VRR or HDR when using that.) You’d mainly get it over an OLED TV if you’re willing to trade some picture quality for something that’s better-suited in a bright room. This deal on the 65-inch model isn’t an all-time low, but it matches the best price we’ve tracked since July. Samsung S90F 55-inch QD-OLED TV for $1,098 ($500 off): The Samsung S90F is an upper-tier model with a QD-OLED panel, which blends the usual perks of a quality OLED set — near-perfect contrast, wide viewing angles, clear motion, low input lag — with a layer of quantum dots. This helps it produce a wider gamut of more vivid colors compared to traditional WOLED TVs. It also comes with four HDMI 2.1 ports and has a fast refresh rate of 144Hz. It doesn’t support Dolby Vision HDR, however, and reviews we trust say that the LG C5, a competing WOLED model, retains darker black levels in a bright room. (The S90F has a more colorful image, though.) This deal marks a new low for the 55-inch model, while the 65-inch and 77-inch versions are also at all-time lows of $1,598 and $2,298, respectively. Just make sure you only buy the 55-, 65- or 77-inch model, as every other size in the US uses a lesser WOLED panel. Shady, we know. LG C5 55-inch OLED TV for $1,297 ($503 off): The LG C5 can’t produce the same bold colors as a QD-OLED display like the Samsung S90F, but reviews almost universally agree that it’s an exceptional OLED TV otherwise. It should get brighter with non-HDR content, and as noted above it should produce deeper blacks in well-lit environments. It also has just about all the essential gaming features, plus it supports the popular Dolby Vision HDR format (but not HDR10+). If you need that, or if you want an OLED set in this price range for a bright-ish room, it’s well worth a look. This ties the lowest price we’ve found for the 55-inch model; other sizes are also on sale, but note that the 42- and 48-inch models can’t get as bright as the larger versions. LG B5 55-inch OLED TV for $997 ($100 off): The B5 is LG’s entry-level OLED TV for 2025, and as such it’s a level below the C5 in terms of brightness and color performance. It’s technically limited to a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 144Hz as well, though that isn’t a huge deal right now unless you plan on hooking up a gaming PC. If anything, last year’s LG C4 — which isn’t seriously discounted as of this writing — is a better value for most on the whole. But if you just want to save cash, the B5 still provides most of the core benefits of an OLED display at a lower price. This is a new all-time low for the 55-inch variant. Sony Bravia 8 II 65-inch QD-OLED TV for $2,800 ($700 off): It’s certainly not cheap, but the Sony Bravia 8 II has earned plaudits for its excellent image processing, upscaling and overall accuracy alongside the expected color, contrast and motion benefits of its QD-OLED display. This should help it make lots of movies and shows look closer to their original intent. It also uses the handy Google TV interface. Outside of an extremely brief dip in June, this deal matches the best price to date for the 65-inch version. That said, if you can’t stomach the high price, other reviews note that the older Sony A95L offers similar performance a bit less, while more recent competitors like the LG G5 and Samsung S95F can get noticeably brighter (even if they’re not always as accurate). Those two should be better for gaming as well, as the Bravia 8 II only has two HDMI 2.1 ports — one of which is an eARC port for soundbars — and its input lag is slightly higher. Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $30 ($20 off): The Streaming Stick 4K is worth considering if you prefer a stick-style streamer that plugs directly into your TV, or if you’re partial to Roku’s app-centric interface, which many find simpler to navigate than the content-heavy UIs pushed by Google and Amazon. It supports Apple AirPlay and the major HDR formats, and its performance remains quick enough for most. You’ll have to deal with some ads, though, and no Roku player supports the Twitch app. This deal is $5 more than the device’s all-time low but ties the best price we’ve seen in several years. Roku Streaming Stick Plus for $24 ($16 off): The Streaming Stick Plus is cheaper alternative to the Streaming Stick 4K with no Dolby Vision support and no long-range Wi-Fi extender built in. The latter means it may be less reliable if you don’t get a consistent connection in your TV’s room. (Both sticks are limited to Wi-Fi 5, though.) That said, this model can typically be powered straight from a TV’s USB port instead of requiring a separate power supply. If you can live with the sacrifices, it may not be worth paying extra. This deal represents a new all-time low. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K for $25 ($25 off): The standard Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K offers the same core experience as the pricier Fire TV Stick 4K Max, only it comes with a slightly slower processor, half the storage (8GB) and Wi-Fi 6 instead of Wi-Fi 6E. For most people just looking for a casual streamer on the cheap, those shouldn’t be huge losses. This model is also more powerful than the just-announced Fire TV 4K Select, though its Fire OS interface can still be messy and ad-heavy, with special emphasis on Amazon’s own services. This deal is $3 more than the stick’s all-time low, though it matches the best price we’ve seen since Black Friday last year. Amazon Fire TV Stick HD for $18 ($17 off): The Fire TV Stick HD is the budget pick in our guide to the best streaming devices. It can only stream up to 1080p, and it can run a bit choppier than the 4K models since it has a slower chipset and half the RAM (1GB). The usual issues with the Fire TV interface still apply here too. But if you just want to add streaming apps to an aging TV or basic monitor for as little cash as possible, it should get the job done. This discount ties the device's lowest price to date.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-tv-deals-save-on-sets-from-lg-samsung-tcl-and-others-180051219.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "Cooking is all about timing, right? So if you’re a home chef looking for an opportunity to save money on new kitchen gear, your deals timer should be pinging right about now. Amazon’s October Prime Day sale has extended to lots of the kitchen appliances and gadgets that Engadget staffers use and recommend. We found deals on Ninja air fryers, Anova sous vide machines, Breville appliances, KitchenAid gadgets and many more. Here are the best Prime Day deals on kitchen tech we could find — along with links to our reviews and guides so you can make informed (and timely) purchases. The best Prime Day kitchen deals Ninja Slushi for $300 ($50 off): We haven’t officially tested this one just yet, but given our love of both the Creami and the Creami Swirl, it’s a fair bet that this one will do good things with cold stuff too. This is the lowest price of the year so far. Vitamix 2-Speed Immersion Blender for $90 ($40): For quick sauces and soups, we like this nifty two-speed hand blender from Vitamix, and said so in our guide to cheap kitchen gadgets. It even comes with a whisk for making your own whipped cream. Vitamix 5-Speed Immersion Blender for $200 ($100 off): If you want a little extra oomph from your hand blender, grab this one. We named it the best counter top replacement model in our guide to the best immersion blenders. The 625 watt motor is more powerful than most and the blender head is intelligently designed to reduce suction and prevent scratches plus it fits inside a wide mouth mason jar. Ninja Creami ice cream maker with extra pints $220 ($35 off with Prime): Here's a bundle that includes two additional pint jars for the ice cream maker. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen tech and we called it a frozen fantasy-maker in our review. Note that the unit itself dipped down to $160 last Black Friday and the extra pints have gone as low as $16. Hamilton Beach Digital Rice Cooker for $37 ($13 off): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is great for small kitchens (but probably not for big families). We thought it outperformed other cookers that are four times the price, though it’s not the best for all-day warming of rice as the bottom bigs got a little overdone. Instant Pot Vortex Plus with Clear Cook for $80 ($20 off with Prime): This Vortex air fryer model is similar to our top airfryer pick, but is missing the Odor Ease feature. It still has the Clear Cook window that lets you keep an eye on your food as it crisps and the Vortex cooking tech heats up remarkably fast, with almost no pre-heating time. Instant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $65 ($65 off): Here’s a smaller version of our best overall air fryer. This one has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly thanks to a 1600-watt output. Instant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn’t take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen. Breville InFizz Fusion beverage maker for $200 ($50 off): We called this fizz-maker the bubble master in our review. True, it’s pricier than rivals in the same space, but the upscale design — that actually looks good on a countertop — somewhat makes up for the price premium. We also appreciate the Fusion Cap that helps prevent messy eruptions when you’re bubbling up your drinks. Cosori Air Fryer Pro Compact for $85 ($15 off with Prime): One of our concerns with the Cosori 9-in-1 was that it was a little on the wide side, taking up extra countertop space. The Pro Compact has a more space-saving design while still packing a five-quart basket. Instant Pot 4QT Vortex mini air fryer for $55 ($35 off with Prime): This model’s four-quart capacity falls between our top Instant Pot air fryer pick and the budget model. It has the Clear Cook window feature, six presets and it comes in pink in addition to the standard white and black. Instant Pot Duo Plus for $90 ($50 off): We named this the best multicooker in our guide to the best kitchen tech we’ve tested. It can cook a dizzying array of foods from basic beans and rice to homemade yogurt. We like this one because it’s simple to use, and has quick-cooking modes for soup, eggs and grains. There’s even a sous vide cooking function. Breville Bambino Plus for $400 ($100 off): In our gift guide for coffee lovers, this espresso machine earned our respect for its compact size and the fact that it doesn’t cost a grand, like some machines do. Plus the controls are easy for beginners to learn but makes silky milkfoam for pro-level latte artists. Breville Juice Fountain Plus for $130 ($20 off): This went as low as $110 back in January, but it’s still a decent discount on a high-powered juice extractor. We were won over by its impressive juicing abilities and despite how it looks, it's surprisingly easy to clean — as long as you do it right away. Ninja Dual Foodie Zone Air Fryer (DZ302) for $160 ($70 off): If you want to air fry two different things at the same time, this is the one to get. This is the same in specs, capacity and wattage as our top pick for a dual-zone air fryer, just with a different model number. It even has a feature that makes sure the two different foods are ready at the same time. Ninja 5.5-quart Air Fryer XL (AF150AMZ) for $130 ($50 off): This one earned an honorable mention in our guide to air fryers. It’s double the capacity of our budget pick and has a dehydrate preset. While we found the round basket a little cramped, we liked how the fryer’s vertical design saved counter space. Just note that this went as low as $90 in July. Vitamix Explorian E310 Blender for $330 ($50 off): This isn’t the best deal we’ve seen this year — this Vitamix dropped to $300 as recently as May. But if you’re in the market for a blender that can turn the most recalcitrant nut into the creamiest butter, we think this won’t let you down.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-kitchen-deals-include-up-to-50-percent-off-our-favorite-air-fryers-and-more-193009268.html?src=rss",
          "content": "Cooking is all about timing, right? So if you’re a home chef looking for an opportunity to save money on new kitchen gear, your deals timer should be pinging right about now. Amazon’s October Prime Day sale has extended to lots of the kitchen appliances and gadgets that Engadget staffers use and recommend. We found deals on Ninja air fryers, Anova sous vide machines, Breville appliances, KitchenAid gadgets and many more. Here are the best Prime Day deals on kitchen tech we could find — along with links to our reviews and guides so you can make informed (and timely) purchases. The best Prime Day kitchen deals Ninja Slushi for $300 ($50 off): We haven’t officially tested this one just yet, but given our love of both the Creami and the Creami Swirl, it’s a fair bet that this one will do good things with cold stuff too. This is the lowest price of the year so far. Vitamix 2-Speed Immersion Blender for $90 ($40): For quick sauces and soups, we like this nifty two-speed hand blender from Vitamix, and said so in our guide to cheap kitchen gadgets. It even comes with a whisk for making your own whipped cream. Vitamix 5-Speed Immersion Blender for $200 ($100 off): If you want a little extra oomph from your hand blender, grab this one. We named it the best counter top replacement model in our guide to the best immersion blenders. The 625 watt motor is more powerful than most and the blender head is intelligently designed to reduce suction and prevent scratches plus it fits inside a wide mouth mason jar. Ninja Creami ice cream maker with extra pints $220 ($35 off with Prime): Here's a bundle that includes two additional pint jars for the ice cream maker. It's one of our favorite pieces of kitchen tech and we called it a frozen fantasy-maker in our review. Note that the unit itself dipped down to $160 last Black Friday and the extra pints have gone as low as $16. Hamilton Beach Digital Rice Cooker for $37 ($13 off): Our top pick for a budget rice cooker is great for small kitchens (but probably not for big families). We thought it outperformed other cookers that are four times the price, though it’s not the best for all-day warming of rice as the bottom bigs got a little overdone. Instant Pot Vortex Plus with Clear Cook for $80 ($20 off with Prime): This Vortex air fryer model is similar to our top airfryer pick, but is missing the Odor Ease feature. It still has the Clear Cook window that lets you keep an eye on your food as it crisps and the Vortex cooking tech heats up remarkably fast, with almost no pre-heating time. Instant Pot Vortex Plus Air Fryer (4QT) for $65 ($65 off): Here’s a smaller version of our best overall air fryer. This one has a four-quart capacity, which is perfect for one person and small kitchens. And, like its larger sibling, pre-heats quickly thanks to a 1600-watt output. Instant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn’t take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen. Breville InFizz Fusion beverage maker for $200 ($50 off): We called this fizz-maker the bubble master in our review. True, it’s pricier than rivals in the same space, but the upscale design — that actually looks good on a countertop — somewhat makes up for the price premium. We also appreciate the Fusion Cap that helps prevent messy eruptions when you’re bubbling up your drinks. Cosori Air Fryer Pro Compact for $85 ($15 off with Prime): One of our concerns with the Cosori 9-in-1 was that it was a little on the wide side, taking up extra countertop space. The Pro Compact has a more space-saving design while still packing a five-quart basket. Instant Pot 4QT Vortex mini air fryer for $55 ($35 off with Prime): This model’s four-quart capacity falls between our top Instant Pot air fryer pick and the budget model. It has the Clear Cook window feature, six presets and it comes in pink in addition to the standard white and black. Instant Pot Duo Plus for $90 ($50 off): We named this the best multicooker in our guide to the best kitchen tech we’ve tested. It can cook a dizzying array of foods from basic beans and rice to homemade yogurt. We like this one because it’s simple to use, and has quick-cooking modes for soup, eggs and grains. There’s even a sous vide cooking function. Breville Bambino Plus for $400 ($100 off): In our gift guide for coffee lovers, this espresso machine earned our respect for its compact size and the fact that it doesn’t cost a grand, like some machines do.

Vitamix Explorian E310 Blender for $330 ($50 off): This isn’t the best deal we’ve seen this year — this Vitamix dropped to $300 as recently as May. But if you’re in the market for a blender that can turn the most recalcitrant nut into the creamiest butter, we think this won’t let you down.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-prime-day-kitchen-deals-include-up-to-50-percent-off-our-favorite-air-fryers-and-more-193009268.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "The best time to buy Apple tech is often right after the company has done a big hardware refresh, as deals on the older products inevitably follow. That’s the case with the Apple Watch Series 10 this Prime Day, with the wearable down to $280, which is a record low. This particular deal applies to the 42mm GPS version of the Apple Watch Series 10 in a variety of color options. And while it is no longer Apple’s flagship smartwatch, with the Series 11 succeeding it last month, it was comfortably our top pick for the best smartwatch until that arrived. Considering its regular list price starts at $399 (the same as the 42mm Series 11), you’re saving some serious cash if you opt for the older device. In our 90-scoring review, we warned any Series 8 or 9 Apple Watch owners that the Series 10 was a fairly unspectacular iterative update, but for first-time buyers or people looking to upgrade from an older model, it’s very easy to recommend. Its larger display makes it easier to check notifications than on previous Apple Watches, while the thinner frame means it looks nicer too. The former flagship Apple Watch unsurprisingly excels at health and fitness tracking, and the blood oxygen app that Apple was forced to remove when the watch launched is now available again after a redesign.

          "standfirst": "Prime Day sales are a great opportunity to nab an expensive bit of shiny new tech you’ve been eying — it’s also an excellent time to get a discount on smaller electronics and accessories. For this list, we compared what’s on sale right now with the stuff we recommend in our guides. For less than $50 each, we found deals on some of our favorite tech including batteries, iPhone paraphernalia, mice, earbuds, speakers, holiday gifts and smart home gear. Some deals require you to be a Prime member, others are open to anyone with half a Benjamin earmarked for Amazon. Here are the best October Prime Day tech deals under $50. Best Prime Day deals under $50 UGREEN Nexode Pro 65W USB-C Flat Charger for $43 ($13 off with Prime): One of our picks from our guide to fast chargers, this Ugreen fella has three ports (one of which is USB-A) and a 65-watt max power output. The folding prongs make it even more compact. Just note that it’s a bit wide and may block adjacent outlets in a crowded power strip. Instant Pot Vortex 2-QT Mini for $38 ($22 off with Prime): The budget model from our air fryer guide may not be large but its two-quart basket is enough to reheat leftovers for two or cook up a batch of frozen appetizers. And, because of its small size, it doesn’t take up a ton of space on your countertops — ideal for a small kitchen. Amazon Echo Pop Kids for $33 ($17 off with Prime): Among the announcements for the new Echo devices, Amazon did not include new Echo Pop Kids models, so this is still the most current model for now. It’s good for smaller spaces, not necessarily audio fidelity, and it comes with six months of free access to Amazon Kids as well as early access to Alexa+. Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $40 ($20 off): Amazon's most powerful streaming dongle supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and Wi-Fi 6E with double the storage of cheaper Fire TV sticks. It earned an honorable mention in our guide to streaming devices and also happens to make a good retro gaming emulator. Blink Video Doorbell for $35 ($35 off): True, Amazon just announced new Blink devices, but those won’t hit the market until after Prime Day is over. If you want a video doorbell right now at an impressively low price, this should serve. We’ve tested Blink security devices before and have been impressed by what you get for such a small price. Ring Battery Doorbell for $50 ($50 off): At $49.99 this juuust qualifies as an under $50 tech deal. If you don’t have doorbell wires at your front entrance, you can still have a camera to capture all the package deliveries and neighborhood animal sightings with the Ring Battery Doorbell. It records video in HD with more vertical coverage than the last model, so you can see people from head to toe. Just note that newer Ring devices are on the way. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (two-pack) for $35 ($35 off): This is currently the top budget pick in our guide to the best security cameras. The Mini 2 is a great option for indoor monitoring or you can put it outside with a weatherproof adapter, but since it needs to be plugged in, we like it for keeping an eye on your pets while you're away and watching over entry ways from the inside. Blink Mini 2 security cameras (three-pack) for $50 ($50 off): A three pack is also on sale and squeezes in just under the $50 mark. Anker 622 5K magnetic power bank with stand for $28 ($20 off with Prime): This 0.5-inch thick power bank attaches magnetically to iPhones and won't get in your way when you're using your phone. It also has a built-in stand so you can watch videos, make FaceTime calls and more hands-free while your phone is powering up. Ring Indoor Cam for $25 ($25 off): While we thought the Blink Mini 2 was a better overall indoor camera in our guide, we do like the Ring app, which is ideal for beginners. Plus you get access to the Ring Neighbors app which is a fascinating glimpse into your neighborhood’s Ring-captured events. Amazon Smart Plug for $13 ($12 off): We named this the best smart plug for Alexa users because it hooks up painlessly and stays connected reliably. Use it to control lamps or your holiday lights using programs and schedules in the Alexa app, or just your voice by talking to your Echo Dot or other Alexa-enabled listener. Levoit Mini Core-P air purifier for $40 ($10 off with Prime): This is the mini version of the top pick in our guide to air purifiers. It has a three-stage filter (pre, activated carbon and particle filters) though that particle filter is not a true HEPA filter. But it’s rated at 250 square feet and can help clear the air in your office or other small room. 8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth controller (Switch 2) for $43 ($27 off): If you’ve got a Switch 2 and are looking for a good controller to go with it, we think this is a good one. Recommended in our guide to the best Switch 2 accessories, it’s got an Xbox style configuration with the left stick placed higher on the game pad, which some prefer. The lowest price we tracked before this is $50. Echo Pop smart speaker for $25 ($15 off): The half sphere Pop is the most affordable Echo speaker in Amazon’s lineup. The sound won’t be as full as its larger siblings, but will do a fine job of bringing Alexa’s help to smaller rooms. Just note that it went as low as $18 for Black Friday and October Prime Day last year. Roku Streaming Stick Plus 2025 for $24 (40 percent off): This is our top pick for the best streaming device for accessing free and live content. The dongle supports 4K video and HDR and doesn’t need to be plugged into the wall for power. It’s a great way to access any streaming service you could ask for: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max and many more. Roku Streaming Stick HD for $18 ($12 off): If you don’t care about 4K (or your screen resolution isn’t that high anyway) you can still get the same simple-to-use Roku OS with this device. The best thing about Roku streaming sticks is the access to all the free content — so this is an affordable way to get it. Leebein 2025 electric spin scrubber for $38 ($32 off with Prime): This is an updated version of the electric scrubber we love that makes shower cleaning easier than ever before. It comes with seven brush heads so you can use it to clean all kinds of surfaces, and its adjustable arm length makes it easier to clean hard-to-reach spots. It's IPX7 waterproof and recharges via USB-C. Jisulife Life7 handheld fan for $23 ($6 off with Prime): This handy little fan is a must-have if you live in a warm climate or have a tropical vacation planned anytime soon. It can be used as a table or handheld fan and even be worn around the neck so you don't have to hold it at all. Its 5,000 mAh battery allows it to last hours on a single charge, and the small display in the middle of the fan's blades shows its remaining battery level. Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go speaker for $23 ($12 off with Prime): This is one of our top picks for Bluetooth speaker. It gets pretty loud for its size and has decent sound quality. You can pair two together for stereo sound as well, and its IP67-rated design will keep it protected against water and dust. Amazon Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): Amazon brought the Echo Spot smart alarm clock back from the dead last year with a new design and improved speakers. In addition to being able to control smart home devices and respond to voice commands, the Echo Spot can also act as a Wi-Fi extender for those that have Eero systems. It went as low as $45 for Black Friday last year. Samsung EVO Select microSD card (256GB) for $23 ($4 off): This Samsung card has been one of our recommended models for a long time. It's a no-frills microSD card that, while not the fastest, will be perfectly capable in most devices where you're just looking for simple, expanded storage. Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam $40 ($20 off): If you like the idea of being able to move the camera around to follow the action in your home, you may want to get a pan-and-tilt option like this one. We will again note that new Ring devices are on the way, but if you don’t have to have the latest thing and just want to see what your dog gets up to while you’re gone, you may want to snag this 33 percent discount. Anker Soundcore Space A40 for $43 ($37 off): Our top pick for the best budget wireless earbuds, the Space A40 have surprisingly good ANC, good sound quality, a comfortable fit and multi-device connectivity. JLab Go Air Pop+ for $17.49 ($12 off): JLab earbuds pop up in a few of our guides including the best running headphones and best budget buds. The Pop+ earbuds are smaller and lighter than the previous model, and the app’s preset EQ modes let you customize your sound. Total battery life with the case comes in at more than 35 hours.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-amazon-prime-day-deals-under-50-include-sales-from-anker-ring-lego-roku-and-others-120531317.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "You’ve probably been tempted to jump on the air-fryer bandwagon in recent months and, if you have not yet taken the plunge, we’re here to help. Like the ubiquitous Instant Pot that came before it, air fryers have surged in popularity as of late, promising extra crispy foods of all kinds without the mess and danger of a big vat of hot oil. These small appliances come in all shapes and sizes now and they can be a versatile addition to your kitchen, so long as you know what they are (and aren’t) capable of. For those who are still deciding on which kind of air fryer is right for them, our guide can demystify the space for you and highlight some of the best air fryers you can get right now. Our current favorite is the Instant Vortex Plus air fryer, but there are a number of others we like that may better suit your lifestyle. Table of contents What does an air fryer do? Best air fryers for 2025 Buying guide for air fryers Air fryer pros and cons Best air fryer accessories How to clean an air fryer How to find air fryer recipes How we test air fryers What does an air fryer do? Let’s clear one thing up first: it’s not frying. Not really. Air fryers are more like smaller convection bake ovens, ones that are often pod-shaped. Most work by combining a heating element and fan, which means the hot air can usually better crisp the outside of food than other methods. They often reach higher top temperatures than toaster ovens – which is part of the appeal. For most recipes, a thin layer of oil (usually sprayed) helps to replicate that fried look and feel better. However, it will rarely taste precisely like the deep-fried or pan frying version when it comes out of the air fryer basket. Don’t let that put you off, though, because the air fryer, in its many forms, combines some of the best parts of other cooking processes and brings them together into an energy-efficient way of air fryer cooking dinner. Or breakfast. Or lunch. Read more: We’ve also rounded up the best pizza ovens and the best sous vide machines. Best air fryers for 2025 Buying guide for air fryers Convection ovens You can separate most of these machines into two types of air fryers, and each has different pros and cons. Convection ovens are usually ovens with air fryer functions and features. They might have higher temperature settings to ensure that food crisps and cooks more like actually fried food. Most convection ovens are larger than dedicated air fryers, defeating some of the purpose of those looking to shrink cooking appliance surface area. Still, they are often more versatile with multiple cooking functions, and most have finer controls for temperatures, timings and even fan speed. You may never need a built-in oven if you have a decent convection oven. They often have the volume to handle roasts, entire chickens or tray bakes, and simply cook more, capacity-wise, making them more versatile than the pod-shaped competition. The flip side of that is that you’ll need counter space in the kitchen to house them. It also means you can use traditional oven accessories, like baking trays or cake tins, that you might already own. Pod-shaped air fryers Pod-shaped air fryers are what you imagine when you think “air fryer.” They look like a cool, space-age kitchen gadget, bigger than a kettle but smaller than a toaster oven. Many use a drawer to hold ingredients while cooking, usually a mesh sheet or a more solid, non-stick tray with holes to allow the hot air to circulate. With a few exceptions, most require you to open the drawer while things cook and flip or shake half-cooked items to ensure the even distribution of heat and airflow to everything. That’s one of a few caveats. This type of air fryer typically doesn't have a window to see how things are cooking (with only a few exceptions), so you’ll need to closely scrutinize things as they cook, opening the device to check progress. Basket-style air fryers also generally use less energy – there’s less space to heat – and many have parts that can be put directly into a dishwasher. Some of the larger pod-shaped air fryers offer two separate compartments, which is especially useful for anyone planning to cook an entire meal with the appliance. You could cook a couple of tasty chicken wings or tenders while simultaneously rustling up enough frozen fries or veggies for everyone. Naturally, those options take up more space, and they’re usually heavy enough to stop you from storing them in cupboards or shelves elsewhere. As mentioned earlier, you might have to buy extra things to make these pod fryers work the way you want them to. Some of the bigger manufacturers, like Philips and Ninja, offer convenient additions, but you’ll have to pay for them. Air fryer pros and cons Beyond the strengths and weaknesses of individual models, air fryers are pretty easy to use from the outset. Most models come with a convenient cooking time booklet covering most of the major foods you’ll be air frying, so even beginners can master these machines. One of the early selling points is the ability to cook fries, wings, frozen foods and other delights with less fat than other methods like deep frying, which gets foods the crispiest. As air fryers work by circulating heated air, the trays and cooking plates have holes that can also let oil and fat drain out of meats, meaning less fat and crisper food when you finally plate things up. For most cooking situations, you will likely need to lightly spray food with vegetable oil. If you don’t, there’s the chance that things will burn or char. The oil will keep things moist on the surface, and we advise refreshing things with a dash of oil spray when you turn items during cooking. Most air fryers are easy to clean – especially in comparison to a shallow or deep fryer. We’ll get into cleaning guidance a little later. With a smaller space to heat, air fryers are generally more energy-efficient for cooking food than larger appliances like ovens. And if you don’t have an oven, air fryers are much more affordable – especially the pod options. There are, however, some drawbacks. While air fryers are easy enough to use, they take time to master. You will adjust cooking times for even the simplest types of food – like chicken nuggets, frozen French fries or brussels sprouts. If you’re the kind of person that loves to find inspiration from the internet, in our experience, you can pretty much throw their timings out of the window. There are a lot of air fryer options, and factors like how fast they heat and how well distributed that heat is can – and will – affect cooking. There’s also a space limitation to air fryers. This is not a TARDIS – there’s simply less space than most traditional ovens and many deep fat fryers. If you have a bigger family, you’ll probably want to go for a large capacity air fryer – possibly one that has multiple cooking areas. You also might want to consider a different kitchen appliance, like a multicooker, sous vide or slow cooker to meet your specific cooking needs. You may also struggle to cook many items through as the heat settings will cook the surface of dishes long before it’s cooked right through. If you’re planning to cook a whole chicken or a roast, please get a meat thermometer! Best air fryer accessories Beyond official accessories from the manufacturer, try to pick up silicone-tipped tools. Tongs are ideal, as is a silicon spatula to gently loosen food that might get stuck on the sides of the air fryer. These silicone mats will also help stop things from sticking to the wire racks on some air fryers. They have holes to ensure the heated air is still able to circulate around the food. Silicone trivets are also useful for resting any cooked food on while you sort out the rest of the meal. And if you find yourself needing oil spray, but don’t feel like repeatedly buying tiny bottles, you can decant your favorite vegetable oil into a permanent mister like this. How to clean an air fryer We’re keeping clean up simple here. Yes, you could use power cleaners from the grocery store, they could damage the surface of your air fryer. Likewise, metal scourers or brushes could strip away the non-stick coating. Remember to unplug the device and let it cool completely. Remove the trays, baskets and everything else from inside. If the manufacturer says the parts are dishwasher safe – and you have a dishwasher – the job is pretty much done. Otherwise, hand wash each part in a mixture of warm water, with a splash of Dawn or another strong dish soap. Use a soft-bristled brush to pull away any crumbs, greasy deposits or bits of food stuck to any surfaces. Remember to rinse everything. Otherwise, your next batch of wings could have a mild Dawn aftertaste. Trust us. Take a microfiber cloth and tackle the outer parts and handles that might also get a little messy after repeated uses. This is especially useful for oven-style air fryers – use the cloth to wipe down the inner sides. If Dawn isn’t shifting oily stains, try mixing a small amount of baking soda with enough water to make a paste, and apply that so that it doesn’t seep into any electrical parts or the heating element. Leave it to work for a few seconds before using a damp cloth to pull any greasy spots away. Rinse out the cloth and wipe everything down again, and you should be ready for the next time you need to air fry. How to find air fryer recipes Beyond fries, nuggets and – a revelation – frozen gyoza, there are a few ways to find recipes for air-fried foods. First, we found that the air fryer instruction manuals often have cooking guides and recipe suggestions for you to test out in your new kitchen gadget. The good thing with these is that they were made for your air fryer model, meaning success should be all but guaranteed. They are often a little unimaginative, however. Many of the top recipe sites and portals have no shortage of air fryer recipes, and there’s no harm in googling your favorite cuisine and adding the words “air fryer” on the end of the search string. We’ve picked up some reliable options from Delish, which also has a handy air fryer time converter for changing oven and traditional fryer recipes. BBC Good Food is also worth browsing for some simple ideas, as is NYT Cooking, with the ability to directly search for air fryer suggestions. Aside from that, you can also grab plenty of cookbooks from your local bookshop with lots of recipes that you can use in your favorite air fryer. And if you have a killer recipe or unique use for your air fryer, let us know in the comments. What’s the air fryer equivalent of the Instant Pot cheesecake? We’re ready to try it. How we test air fryers We put each air fryer we test through its paces by cooking a variety of foods in it including raw proteins like fish and chicken, raw vegetables like potatoes and cauliflower and frozen snacks like mozzarella sticks. We attempt to use each cooking method that the machine has pre-programmed, and when possible, follow a couple of recipes in any provided recipe booklets that come with the air fryer. We also clean the cooking basket and all other removable components as many times as possible, and will put those components into a dishwasher if they claim to be dishwasher-safe. We also make note of how loud the machine is when using different cooking settings and how warm the surrounding area becomes.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-air-fryers-133047180.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "If you've been eyeing a new Dyson vacuum but balking at their typically high price tags, Prime Day is the perfect day to make a move. You can get a Dyson V8 Plus for 44 percent off for Prime Day, bringing the powerful handheld vacuum down to $300, its lowest price to date. The Dyson V8 Plus is the same basic vacuum as the original V8, just with a wider selection of accessories that should ideally make it even more essential to your cleaning routine. The Dyson V8 Plus has 115AW of suction, and a 40-minute run time that should give you more than enough flexibility to clean a small home or apartment. Dyson also says the vacuum's filter can capture 99.9 percent of dust, particles and allergens. Like some of Dyson's other stick vacuums, the Dyson V8 Plus can work in handheld mode when you need to get in the crevices of couch cushions or shelves. It's also designed to easily empty dust and debris directly into a trash can without having to unscrew its filter. In terms of accessories, purchasing the V8 Plus gets you the main \"Motorbar\" cleaner head, a hair screw attachment for untangling long hairs, a mini soft dusting brush for sweeping off flat surfaces and a crevice tool for getting into small spaces. The Dyson V8 Plus, while good, isn't on Engadget's best cordless vacuums list, but a pick from the list is on sale for Prime Day. You can get the Dyson V15 Detect Plus for $570 during Amazon's sale, a not insignificant discount on a vacuum that's typically sold for more than $800. The Dyson V15 Detect Plus offers 240AW of suction in comparison to the V8 Plus' 115AW, and it can run for 60 minutes on a single charge, giving you even more time to clean. You'll also get more accessories in comparison to Dyson's other vacuum. On top of the usual suspects like the hair screw tool and the mini dusting brush, the V15 Detect Plus also supports the company's \"Fluffy Optic\" cleaner head, which uses a built-in light to reveal hidden dust and hair.

          "title": "The best wireless earbuds for 2025",
          "standfirst": "Wireless earbuds have become the go-to choice for listening on the move. Whether you’re at the gym, commuting or relaxing at home, the best wireless earbuds give you comfort, freedom and solid sound quality without tangled cables. They’re lightweight, slip easily into your pocket and connect quickly to your phone, tablet or laptop.The tricky part is choosing the right pair. Some models focus on powerful noise cancellation while others put battery life or affordability first. Then you’ve got features like water resistance for workouts or touch controls for quick track changes. With so many choices, finding the best wireless earbuds depends on what matters most to you, and that’s exactly what this guide will help you figure out. Table of contents Best wireless earbuds of 2025 What to look for in the best wireless earbuds How we test wireless earbuds Other wireless earbuds we tested Wireless earbuds FAQs Best wireless earbuds of 2025 What to look for in the best wireless earbuds When it comes to shopping for earphones, the first thing to consider is design or wear style. Do you prefer a semi-open fit like AirPods or do you want something that completely closes off your ears? If you’re shopping for earbuds with active noise cancellation, you'll want the latter, but a case can be made for the former if you want to wear them all day or frequent places where you need to be tuned in to the ambient sounds. The overall shape of earbuds can determine whether you get a comfortable fit, so can the size and weight, so you’ll want to consider all that before deciding. And remember: audio companies aren’t perfect, so despite lots of research, the earbud shape they decided on may not fit you well. Don’t be afraid to return ill-fitting earbuds for something that’s more comfortable. As wireless earbuds have become the norm, they’re now more reliable for basic things like consistent Bluetooth connectivity. Companies are still in a race to pack as much as they can into increasingly smaller designs. This typically means a longer list of features on the more premium sets of earbuds with basic functionality on the cheapest models. Carefully consider what you can’t live without when selecting your next earbuds, and make sure key items like automatic pausing and multipoint connectivity are on the spec sheet. You’ll also want to investigate the volume and touch controls as you’ll often have to sacrifice access to something else to make that adjustment via on-board taps or swipes. Some earbuds even offer app settings to tweak the audio profiles or firmware updates to improve performance over time. For those in the Apple ecosystem, features like auto-pairing with devices, especially with AirPods Pro 3, can be an added advantage, while Android users may want to look for models that offer similar cross-device functionality. When it comes to battery life, the average set of earbuds lasts about five hours on a single charge. You can find sets that last longer, but this is likely enough to get you through a work day if you’re docking the buds during lunch or the occasional meeting. You’ll want to check on how many extra charges are available via the case and if it supports wireless charging. Companies will also make lofty claims about call quality on wireless earbuds. Despite lots of promises, the reality is most earbuds still leave you sounding like you’re on speakerphone. There are some sets that deliver, but don’t get your hopes up unless reviews confirm the claims. Sound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. This is especially true if you're an audiophile. We understand this isn’t easy when most of us do a lot of shopping online, but trying on a set of earbuds and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer's remorse. If a store doesn’t allow a quick demo, most retailers have return policies that will let you take earbuds back you don’t like. Of course, you have to be willing to temporarily part with funds in order to do this. We also recommend paying attention to things like Spatial Audio, Dolby Atmos, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all earbuds support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you, especially if you plan to use them for playback of high-quality audio. How we test wireless earbuds The primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for earbuds is typically less than a full day, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). To judge audio quality, we listen to a range of genres, noting any differences in the sound profile across the styles. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess call quality, we’ll record audio samples with the earbuds’ microphones as well as have third parties call us. When it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older buds. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of earbuds that we review. Other wireless Bluetooth earbuds we tested Sony WF-C710N The WF-C710N is a set of compact and comfy earbuds that offer several of Sony’s best features. While the ANC performance is above average for this price ($120), sound quality isn’t as good as the company’s slightly more expensive options. Battery life fell below stated figures and call performance isn’t good enough to use these buds for work. Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 The newest version of the Powerbeats Pro have an improved, comfortable design, balanced bass and new H2 chips and a heart rate sensor inside. But heart rate support is currently limited on iOS. Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 The Galaxy Buds 3 combine ANC with an open-type design, which renders the noise-blocking abilities of the earbuds mostly useless. Still, there’s great low-end tone with ample bass when a track demands it. There are also lots of handy features, most of which require a Samsung phone. But at this price, there are better options from Google, Beats and Sony Sennheiser Momentum Sport I really like the overall shape of the Momentum Sport earbuds. They’re more comfortable than the Momentum True Wireless 4 and fit in my ears better. What’s more, the body temperature and heart rate sensors work well, sending those stats to a variety of apps. However, that sport-tracking feature works best with Polar’s app and devices, so there’s that consideration. Also, the audio quality and ANC performance isn’t as good as the MTW4, and these earbuds are pricey. Beats Solo Buds There’s a lot to like about the Solo Buds for $80. For me, the primary perk is they’re very comfortable to wear for long periods of time thanks to some thoughtful design considerations. You only get the basics here in terms of features and, as expected, the overall sound quality isn’t as good as the pricier models in the Beats lineup. You will get 18 hours of battery life though, since the company nixed the battery in the case and beefed up the listening time in the buds themselves. Bose Ultra Open Earbuds Bose created something very unique for this set of earbuds that allows you to stay in-tune with the world while listening to audio content. The clip-on design is very comfortable, but sound quality suffers due to the open-type fit, especially when it comes to bass and spatial audio. Audio-Technica ATH-TWX7 These stick buds have a compact design that’s comfortable to wear and the warm sound profile is great at times. However, overall audio performance is inconsistent and there’s no automatic pausing. Master & Dynamic MW09 Retooled audio, better ambient sound mode and reliable multipoint Bluetooth are the best things the MW09 has to offer. They’re expensive though, and you can find better ANC performance elsewhere. Wireless earbud FAQs What is considered good battery life for true wireless earbuds? Most wireless earbuds will last five hours on a single charge, at the least. You can find some pairs that have even better battery life, lasting between six and eight hours before they need more juice. All of the best wireless earbuds come with a charging case, which will provide additional hours of battery life — but you'll have to return each bud to the case in order to charge them up. Is sound quality better on headphones or earbuds? Comparing sound quality on earbuds and headphones is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. There are a lot of variables to consider and the differences in components make a direct comparison difficult. Personally, I prefer the audio quality from over-ear headphones, but I can tell you the sound from earbuds like Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 3 is also outstanding. Which wireless earbuds have the longest battery life? With new models coming out all the time, tracking the hours of battery life for each this can be difficult to keep tabs on. The longest-lasting earbuds we’ve reviewed are Audio-Technica’s ATH-CKS5TW. The company states they last 15 hours, but the app was still showing 40 percent at that mark during our tests. The only downside is these earbuds debuted in 2019 and both technology and features have improved since. In terms of current models, Master & Dynamic’s MW08 offers 12 hours of use on a charge with ANC off (10 with ANC on) and JBL has multiple options with 10-hour batteries. What wireless earbuds are waterproof? There are plenty of options these days when it comes to increased water resistance. To determine the level of protection, you’ll want to look for an IP (ingress protection) rating. The first number indicates intrusion protection from things like dust. The second number is the level of moisture protection and you’ll want to make sure that figure is 7 or higher. At this water-resistance rating, earbuds can withstand full immersion for up to 30 minutes in depths up to one meter (3.28 feet). If either of the IP numbers is an X, that means it doesn’t have any special protection. For example, a pair of wireless earbuds that are IPX7 wouldn’t be built to avoid dust intrusion, but they would be ok if you dropped them in shallow water. Which earbuds stay in ears the best? A secure fit can vary wildly from person to person. All of our ears are different, so audio companies are designing their products to fit the most people they can with a single shape. This is why AirPods will easily fall out for some but stay put for others. Design touches like wing tips or fins typically come on fitness models and those elements can help keep things in place. You’ll likely just have to try earbuds on, and if they don’t fit well return them. What wireless earbuds work with PS5? PlayStation 5 doesn’t support Bluetooth audio without an adapter or dongle. Even Sony’s own gaming headsets come with a transmitter that connects to the console. There are universal options that allow you to use any headphones, headset or earbuds with a PS5. Once you have one, plug it into a USB port on the console and pair your earbuds with it. Recent updates September 2025: Updated to add AirPods Pro 3 to our top picks.

          "content": "Wireless earbuds have become the go-to choice for listening on the move. Whether you’re at the gym, commuting or relaxing at home, the best wireless earbuds give you comfort, freedom and solid sound quality without tangled cables. They’re lightweight, slip easily into your pocket and connect quickly to your phone, tablet or laptop.The tricky part is choosing the right pair. Some models focus on powerful noise cancellation while others put battery life or affordability first. Then you’ve got features like water resistance for workouts or touch controls for quick track changes. With so many choices, finding the best wireless earbuds depends on what matters most to you, and that’s exactly what this guide will help you figure out. Table of contents Best wireless earbuds of 2025 What to look for in the best wireless earbuds How we test wireless earbuds Other wireless earbuds we tested Wireless earbuds FAQs Best wireless earbuds of 2025 What to look for in the best wireless earbuds When it comes to shopping for earphones, the first thing to consider is design or wear style. Do you prefer a semi-open fit like AirPods or do you want something that completely closes off your ears? If you’re shopping for earbuds with active noise cancellation, you'll want the latter, but a case can be made for the former if you want to wear them all day or frequent places where you need to be tuned in to the ambient sounds. The overall shape of earbuds can determine whether you get a comfortable fit, so can the size and weight, so you’ll want to consider all that before deciding. And remember: audio companies aren’t perfect, so despite lots of research, the earbud shape they decided on may not fit you well. Don’t be afraid to return ill-fitting earbuds for something that’s more comfortable. As wireless earbuds have become the norm, they’re now more reliable for basic things like consistent Bluetooth connectivity. Companies are still in a race to pack as much as they can into increasingly smaller designs. This typically means a longer list of features on the more premium sets of earbuds with basic functionality on the cheapest models. Carefully consider what you can’t live without when selecting your next earbuds, and make sure key items like automatic pausing and multipoint connectivity are on the spec sheet. You’ll also want to investigate the volume and touch controls as you’ll often have to sacrifice access to something else to make that adjustment via on-board taps or swipes. Some earbuds even offer app settings to tweak the audio profiles or firmware updates to improve performance over time. For those in the Apple ecosystem, features like auto-pairing with devices, especially with AirPods Pro 3, can be an added advantage, while Android users may want to look for models that offer similar cross-device functionality. When it comes to battery life, the average set of earbuds lasts about five hours on a single charge. You can find sets that last longer, but this is likely enough to get you through a work day if you’re docking the buds during lunch or the occasional meeting. You’ll want to check on how many extra charges are available via the case and if it supports wireless charging. Companies will also make lofty claims about call quality on wireless earbuds. Despite lots of promises, the reality is most earbuds still leave you sounding like you’re on speakerphone. There are some sets that deliver, but don’t get your hopes up unless reviews confirm the claims. Sound can be subjective, so we recommend trying before you buy if at all possible. This is especially true if you're an audiophile. We understand this isn’t easy when most of us do a lot of shopping online, but trying on a set of earbuds and listening to them for a few minutes can save you from an expensive case of buyer's remorse. If a store doesn’t allow a quick demo, most retailers have return policies that will let you take earbuds back you don’t like. Of course, you have to be willing to temporarily part with funds in order to do this. We also recommend paying attention to things like Spatial Audio, Dolby Atmos, 360 Reality Audio and other immersive formats. Not all earbuds support them, so you’ll want to make sure a perspective pair does if that sort of thing excites you, especially if you plan to use them for playback of high-quality audio. How we test wireless earbuds The primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. We prefer to do this over a one- to two-week period, but sometimes embargoes don’t allow it. During this time, we listen to a mix of music and podcasts, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls. Since battery life for earbuds is typically less than a full day, we drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). To judge audio quality, we listen to a range of genres, noting any differences in the sound profile across the styles. We also test at both low and high volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. To assess call quality, we’ll record audio samples with the earbuds’ microphones as well as have third parties call us. When it comes to features, we do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as we work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds we’re testing are an updated version of a previous model, we’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older buds.

But a $35 saving on last year’s updated Echo Spot might make your decision a bit easier — you can thank Prime Day deals for that. The latest incarnation of the diminutive Spot was introduced in July 2024, and this matches its record-low price. For that you get a comfortably bedside-sized device with a sharper display than its predecessor, as well as superior sound. The front face is divided into two halves, with a speaker positioned below the hemispherical display. What screen you do have is more than enough to display the time and weather information, plus it can show you the song or album title and accompanying artwork when you’re listening to music on those improved speakers. It can naturally be used to boss around your other connected smart devices, too. Alexa might be baked in, but the Echo Spot is intended to be a fairly bare-bones smart alarm clock, so don’t expect as many features as you’ll find on something like the Echo Show 5. But a lot of people just want a modern alarm clock, and arguably the biggest selling point for the Echo Spot is its total lack of a camera. While that means it can do less than the original 2017 Echo Spot, which Amazon did put a camera in, the decision to remove it from a device that lives right next to your bed was probably for the best.

          "standfirst": "Camera buyers usually mark Amazon's October Prime Day on their calendars as it's a great way to get a nice discount on a major purchase — especially since recent tariffs have caused price increases with some brands. This year's sale looks like a good one, with genuine value available on camera equipment, drone and accessory purchases. Some key deals include discounts on DJI drones, action cams and wireless mics, along with sales on cameras from Sony, Canon, Insta360, GoPro and Nikon. Many of those cameras are ranked highly in our most recent camera guide, like Nikon's Z6 III and the Panasonic S5 IIx — so feel free to check that out as you add items to your cart. Without further delay, here are the best Prime Day camera deals you can grab this week. Best Prime Day camera deals DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but it has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off). DJI Osmo Action 4 for $229 (23 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 4 is a solid deal at this price, as you're not giving up much in comparison to the most recent model, the Action 5. It has the same big 1/1.3-inch sensor that delivers excellent video quality, especially in low light. It also features a D-LogM profile to boost dynamic range, DJI's excellent clip-on mount and high-quality 4K 120p video. DJI Mini 4K drone for $239 (20 percent off): The Mini 4K is a beginner-friendly drone, but it's still got plenty of nifty features. As the name suggests, it can capture 4K video at up to 30 FPS. It can also record 2.7K footage at 60 FPS. There's 2x digital zoom, a 3-axis gimbal and electrical image stabilization. The drone can transmit 1080p video from up to 10km away. DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro for $269 (21 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 5 Pro is a good alternative to GoPro's Hero 13 Black. I has a 1/1.3-inch sensor that makes it better than its rival in low light and rivals it in battery life as well with over two hours while shooting in 4K 60p. Another nice feature is 47GB of internal storage, something its main rivals lack. And the Osmo Action 5 Pro works directly with DJI’s noise-cancelling Mic 2 and Mic Mini wireless microphones, providing an easy way to record high-quality sound. GoPro Hero 13 Black for $359 (17 percent off): GoPro’s Hero 13 Black is now available with a new family of modular lenses called the HB series (ultra-wide, anamorphic and macro), making it far more versatile for action creators. It also has a slightly bigger battery that allows longer capture times, up to 90 minutes for 4K 30fps video. Other specs remain the same, including up to 5.3K at 60fps in 10-bit color, along with the excellent Hypersmooth stabilization. DJI Osmo 360 action cam for $413 (25 percent off): It took DJI awhile to get a panoramic action cam into the market, but the Osmo 360 was worth the wait. It stacks up well against its main rival, Insta360’s X5, by offering better video quality in low light or high-contrast situations. It’s also easy to use, offers good battery life and trumps its competition with a large amount of built-in storage. Insta360 X5 action camera for $500 (9 percent off): The X5 has a larger 1/1.28-inch sensor compared to the X4's 1/2-inch sensor, ensuring more detail and a notable boost to low-light performance. Another key update is for PureVideo, allowing it work single lens mode rather than just in 360 mode as before. Sony ZV-1F for $498 (17 percent off): Sony's ZV-1F is designed purely for vlogging thanks to the fixed 20mm lens that works perfectly for self-filming. It uses a 1-inch sensor like other compacts in this series and supports 4K shooting at up to 30 fps, the same as the ZV-1, and 1080p at up to an impressive 120fps. It offers vlog-ready features like background defocus and product showcase. Canon EOS R100 with RT-S18-45mm lens for $529 (15 percent off): Canon's EOS R100 is the only modern mirrorless camera you can get with a kit lens for under $600. It comes with a 24-megapixel APS-C sensor that delivers great picture quality with Canon's pleasing skin tones. Canon EOS R50 with RF-S18-45mm lens $799 (9 percent off): Canon's 24-megapixel APS-C EOS R50 is great for travel, parties, street photography and more thanks to the portable size and built-in flash. It offers nice image quality with warm, human friendly photos and is capable for creators as well with 4K 30fps supersampled video, with 10-bit and HDR capability. It comes with a kit lens that's solid for vlogging or photography with a 24-70mm full-frame equivalent zoom range. Sony A6100 with 16-50mm and 55-210mm lenses $800 (33 percent off): If you want to hit the ground running with a camera and lenses on the cheap, Sony's A6100 is an outstanding value right now. While five years old, its autofocus system is still among the best thanks to its intelligent face- and eye-tracking, along with 4K 30 fps video. The color science and low-light capabilities are excellent, so photos are sharp and color accurate, even in dimly-lit environments. The drawbacks are bad rolling shutter and a low-resolution EVF. Still, you won't find much comparable in this price range with two lenses to boot. Panasonic Lumix S9 for $1,198 (20 percent off): The S9 may be Panasonic's smallest full-frame camera but it comes with the same 24MP sensor and similar video features to the popular S5 II. To that end, it offers up to 6.2K video, in-body stabilization and reliable autofocus. The key feature though is a special LUT button that lets you easily choose a custom cinematic look designed by professional creators. Panasonic S5 II for $1,498 (25 percent off): It’s the company’s first camera with hybrid phase-detect AF designed to make focus \"wobble\" and other issues a thing of the past. You can shoot sharp 4K 30p video downsampled from the full sensor width, or 4K 60p from an APS-C cropped size, all in 10-bit color. It even offers 5.9K 30p video. You also get a flip-out screen for vlogging and updated five-axis in-body stabilization that’s the best in the industry. Photo quality is also good thanks to the dual-gain 24-megapixel sensor. The main drawback is the slowish burst speeds. Sony A7 IV for $2,198 (19 percent off): Resolution is up considerably from the 24-megapixel A7 III to 33 megapixels, with image quality much improved overall. Video is now up to par with rivals with 4K at up to 60p with 10 bit 4:2:2 quality. Autofocus is incredible for both video and stills, and the in-body stabilization does a good job. The biggest drawback is rolling shutter that limits the use of the electronic shutter. Panasonic S5 IIx with two lenses for $2,298 (22 percent off): The S5 IIx is identical to the S5 II except that it offers high bitrate Apple ProRes capture directly to an external SSD. This deal is ideal for creators who want to hit the ground running as it includes both a 50mm f/1.8 portrait lens and a 22-60mm zoom. Nikon Z6 III for $2,397 (11 percent off): Nikon's Z6 III is the best hybrid mirrorless camera for the money, thanks to the incredible performance of the 24-megapixel partially stacked sensor. You can shoot RAW bursts at up to 20 fps in electronic shutter mode while nailing sharp shots thanks to the much-improved autofocus. On the video side, it supports 6K RAW at up to 60 fps, or 4K 120p. All of that makes it ideal for creators and photographers alike, with the only drawback being the reduced resolution. Sony A7R V for $3,798 (10 percent off): With a 61-megapixel sensor, the A7R V shoots sharp and beautiful images at a very respectable speed for such a high-resolution model (10 fps). It has equally fast and reliable autofocus, the sharpest viewfinder on the market and in-body stabilization that’s much improved over the A7R IV. Video has even improved, with 8K and 10-bit options now on tap, albeit with significant rolling shutter Best Prime Day camera lens and accessory deals Osmo Mobile 7 for $68 (24 percent off): One of the best things to elevate your smartphone footage is a gimbal like the Osmo Mobile 7 from DJI. The company makes some of the best drones you can buy, so it knows a thing or two about camera stabilization, so it will make your smarphone videos smooth as silk. It only weighs 300 grams, so it’ll be a lightweight addition to almost any travel kit. K&F Concept 20L camera backpack for $66 (20 percent off): This multifunction backpack can store not only cameras, lenses and even drones in the bottom section, but a couple of changes of clothes up top. It has a laptop compartment, ventilated elastic back, auxiliary straps and more. DJI Mic Mini $99 (41 percent off): DJI's Mic Mini bundle includes two mic transmitters and a receiver that can be connected to a camera or phone, along with a charging case. The mics weigh just a third of an ounce and attach easily to subjects via magnets or clips. Everything pairs automatically and they offer high quality 24-bit 20Hz to 20K Hz recording. They also connect easily to smartphones over Bluetooth and other DJI devices like the Action 5 and Osmo Pocket 3 cams using DJI's OsmoAudio direct connection. SanDisk 512GB Extreme Pro CFexpress Card Type B for $120 (24 percent off): If you need tons of storage for a newer camera with a CFexpress Type B slot, SanDisk's 512GB is a great deal. It can handle reading and writing at 1,700MB/s and 1,400MB/s respectively, enough speed for RAW video capture. Lowepro Flipside BP 300 AW III for $182 (24 percent off): The Flipside BP300 AW III is a rugged, lightweight bag that securely holds and protects your camera gear in the worst weather. It has rear access for protection and a special compartment to hold lenses. DJI Mic 2 for $269 (23 percent off): DJI's Mic 2 can not only be connected to a mirrorless camera like other mics, but also supports Bluetooth audio so can easily be connected to a smartphone as well. It picks up audio from your subject at a range of up to 820 feet (less with a Bluetooth connection) and automatically reduces background noise like wind, city sounds and even drone noise. This deal includes two mic transmitters, a receiver for your camera, a charging case and wind muffs. DJI RS 4 Mini $309 (16 percent off): The RS 4 Mini is one of the best handheld camera stabilizers on the market thanks to features like its 4.4 pound payload and automatic axis lock. On top of that, the company introduced automatic tracking via its RS Intelligent Tracking Module to keep human subjects in frame no matter where they go. It also offers smoother gimbal tracking, longer battery life and faster charging. Lexar 128GB Professional 2000x SD Card $90 (31 percent off): If you need very fast SD UHS II memory, Lexar currently has an excellent deal on its 128GB 2000x memory card. It offers 300MB/s read and 260Mb/s write speeds, quick enough to capture high data rate video or bursts of high-resolution photos. Amazon is also offering a solid discount on 256GB memory in the same lineup at $170 or 23 percent off. Manfrotto Befree GT PRO 4-section travel tripod $299 (36 percent off): Belying its miniscule 4.23 pound weight, this model offers ultra-stable performance for timelapse and other shots, even in bad weather. It's also great for video thanks to the integrated 3-way pan/tilt head, featuring fluid cartridges for precise control and seamless movements. Panasonic Lumix G 25mm f/1.7 lens $248 (17 percent off): Panasonic and Micro Four Thirds users on a budget in need of a fast 50mm equivalent prime should check this one out. It offers beautiful bokeh and fast speeds in low light, but costs nearly half the price of f/1.4 models. Nikon Nikkor Z 50mm f/1.4 Lens $497 (17 percent off): If you want a fast 50mm portrait lens but don't have a ton to spend, Nikon's Nikkor Z 50mm f/1.4 lens is on sale for just $497, making it one of the cheapest full-frame options available. At the same time, it offers exceptional sharpness and excellent color rendition, with beautiful bokeh that will flatter your subjects. Panasonic Lumix S 85mm f/1.8 lens $448 (31 percent off): I own this lens and it's fast, sharp and versatile for portraits while offering considerable savings compared to an f/1.4 portrait. It's also great for working pros due to the dust-, splash- and freeze-resistant design and very light weight next to other brands. Nikon Nikkor Z 35mm f/1.4 Lens $577 (15 percent off): If you're looking for a fast full-frame Nikon Z prime in the 35-50mm category for portraits, architecture or street photos, Nikon has a stellar deal. The Nikkor Z 35mm f/1.4 lens is fast and sharp with painterly bokeh thanks to the 9-blade iris design. It's great for video as well, with the silent STM mechanism offering silent autofocus and suppressed focus breathing. Canon RF24-70mm F2.8 L lens $2,399 (8 percent off): If you've been eyeballing a fast Canon RF mount zoom, now's the time to act. The RF24-70mm f/2.8 L lens rarely goes on sale, but is now available with a $200 (8 percent) discount. It offers an f/2.8 aperture across the entire zoom range so you get awesome bokeh for portraits and high versatility in low light situations.

          "content": "Camera buyers usually mark Amazon's October Prime Day on their calendars as it's a great way to get a nice discount on a major purchase — especially since recent tariffs have caused price increases with some brands. This year's sale looks like a good one, with genuine value available on camera equipment, drone and accessory purchases. Some key deals include discounts on DJI drones, action cams and wireless mics, along with sales on cameras from Sony, Canon, Insta360, GoPro and Nikon. Many of those cameras are ranked highly in our most recent camera guide, like Nikon's Z6 III and the Panasonic S5 IIx — so feel free to check that out as you add items to your cart. Without further delay, here are the best Prime Day camera deals you can grab this week. Best Prime Day camera deals DJI Neo drone for $159 (20 percent off): The DJI Neo may be an inexpensive, beginner-friendly drone, but it has powerful features like subject tracking and quick shots. It can shoot video at up to 4K 30 fps and is quick and maneuverable, though it's also fairly loud. You can also grab one with three batteries and a charger for $229 (21 percent off). DJI Osmo Action 4 for $229 (23 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 4 is a solid deal at this price, as you're not giving up much in comparison to the most recent model, the Action 5. It has the same big 1/1.3-inch sensor that delivers excellent video quality, especially in low light. It also features a D-LogM profile to boost dynamic range, DJI's excellent clip-on mount and high-quality 4K 120p video. DJI Mini 4K drone for $239 (20 percent off): The Mini 4K is a beginner-friendly drone, but it's still got plenty of nifty features. As the name suggests, it can capture 4K video at up to 30 FPS. It can also record 2.7K footage at 60 FPS. There's 2x digital zoom, a 3-axis gimbal and electrical image stabilization. The drone can transmit 1080p video from up to 10km away. DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro for $269 (21 percent off): DJI's Osmo Action 5 Pro is a good alternative to GoPro's Hero 13 Black. I has a 1/1.3-inch sensor that makes it better than its rival in low light and rivals it in battery life as well with over two hours while shooting in 4K 60p. Another nice feature is 47GB of internal storage, something its main rivals lack. And the Osmo Action 5 Pro works directly with DJI’s noise-cancelling Mic 2 and Mic Mini wireless microphones, providing an easy way to record high-quality sound. GoPro Hero 13 Black for $359 (17 percent off): GoPro’s Hero 13 Black is now available with a new family of modular lenses called the HB series (ultra-wide, anamorphic and macro), making it far more versatile for action creators. It also has a slightly bigger battery that allows longer capture times, up to 90 minutes for 4K 30fps video. Other specs remain the same, including up to 5.3K at 60fps in 10-bit color, along with the excellent Hypersmooth stabilization. DJI Osmo 360 action cam for $413 (25 percent off): It took DJI awhile to get a panoramic action cam into the market, but the Osmo 360 was worth the wait. It stacks up well against its main rival, Insta360’s X5, by offering better video quality in low light or high-contrast situations. It’s also easy to use, offers good battery life and trumps its competition with a large amount of built-in storage. Insta360 X5 action camera for $500 (9 percent off): The X5 has a larger 1/1.28-inch sensor compared to the X4's 1/2-inch sensor, ensuring more detail and a notable boost to low-light performance. Another key update is for PureVideo, allowing it work single lens mode rather than just in 360 mode as before. Sony ZV-1F for $498 (17 percent off): Sony's ZV-1F is designed purely for vlogging thanks to the fixed 20mm lens that works perfectly for self-filming. It uses a 1-inch sensor like other compacts in this series and supports 4K shooting at up to 30 fps, the same as the ZV-1, and 1080p at up to an impressive 120fps. It offers vlog-ready features like background defocus and product showcase. Canon EOS R100 with RT-S18-45mm lens for $529 (15 percent off): Canon's EOS R100 is the only modern mirrorless camera you can get with a kit lens for under $600. It comes with a 24-megapixel APS-C sensor that delivers great picture quality with Canon's pleasing skin tones. Canon EOS R50 with RF-S18-45mm lens $799 (9 percent off): Canon's 24-megapixel APS-C EOS R50 is great for travel, parties, street photography and more thanks to the portable size and built-in flash. It offers nice image quality with warm, human friendly photos and is capable for creators as well with 4K 30fps supersampled video, with 10-bit and HDR capability. It comes with a kit lens that's solid for vlogging or photography with a 24-70mm full-frame equivalent zoom range. Sony A6100 with 16-50mm and 55-210mm lenses $800 (33 percent off): If you want to hit the ground running with a camera and lenses on the cheap, Sony's A6100 is an outstanding value right now. While five years old, its autofocus system is still among the best thanks to its intelligent face- and eye-tracking, along with 4K 30 fps video. The color science and low-light capabilities are excellent, so photos are sharp and color accurate, even in dimly-lit environments. The drawbacks are bad rolling shutter and a low-resolution EVF. Still, you won't find much comparable in this price range with two lenses to boot. Panasonic Lumix S9 for $1,198 (20 percent off): The S9 may be Panasonic's smallest full-frame camera but it comes with the same 24MP sensor and similar video features to the popular S5 II. To that end, it offers up to 6.2K video, in-body stabilization and reliable autofocus. The key feature though is a special LUT button that lets you easily choose a custom cinematic look designed by professional creators. Panasonic S5 II for $1,498 (25 percent off): It’s the company’s first camera with hybrid phase-detect AF designed to make focus \"wobble\" and other issues a thing of the past. You can shoot sharp 4K 30p video downsampled from the full sensor width, or 4K 60p from an APS-C cropped size, all in 10-bit color. It even offers 5.9K 30p video. You also get a flip-out screen for vlogging and updated five-axis in-body stabilization that’s the best in the industry. Photo quality is also good thanks to the dual-gain 24-megapixel sensor. The main drawback is the slowish burst speeds. Sony A7 IV for $2,198 (19 percent off): Resolution is up considerably from the 24-megapixel A7 III to 33 megapixels, with image quality much improved overall. Video is now up to par with rivals with 4K at up to 60p with 10 bit 4:2:2 quality. Autofocus is incredible for both video and stills, and the in-body stabilization does a good job. The biggest drawback is rolling shutter that limits the use of the electronic shutter. Panasonic S5 IIx with two lenses for $2,298 (22 percent off): The S5 IIx is identical to the S5 II except that it offers high bitrate Apple ProRes capture directly to an external SSD. This deal is ideal for creators who want to hit the ground running as it includes both a 50mm f/1.8 portrait lens and a 22-60mm zoom. Nikon Z6 III for $2,397 (11 percent off): Nikon's Z6 III is the best hybrid mirrorless camera for the money, thanks to the incredible performance of the 24-megapixel partially stacked sensor. You can shoot RAW bursts at up to 20 fps in electronic shutter mode while nailing sharp shots thanks to the much-improved autofocus. On the video side, it supports 6K RAW at up to 60 fps, or 4K 120p. All of that makes it ideal for creators and photographers alike, with the only drawback being the reduced resolution. Sony A7R V for $3,798 (10 percent off): With a 61-megapixel sensor, the A7R V shoots sharp and beautiful images at a very respectable speed for such a high-resolution model (10 fps). It has equally fast and reliable autofocus, the sharpest viewfinder on the market and in-body stabilization that’s much improved over the A7R IV. Video has even improved, with 8K and 10-bit options now on tap, albeit with significant rolling shutter Best Prime Day camera lens and accessory deals Osmo Mobile 7 for $68 (24 percent off): One of the best things to elevate your smartphone footage is a gimbal like the Osmo Mobile 7 from DJI. The company makes some of the best drones you can buy, so it knows a thing or two about camera stabilization, so it will make your smarphone videos smooth as silk. It only weighs 300 grams, so it’ll be a lightweight addition to almost any travel kit. K&F Concept 20L camera backpack for $66 (20 percent off): This multifunction backpack can store not only cameras, lenses and even drones in the bottom section, but a couple of changes of clothes up top. It has a laptop compartment, ventilated elastic back, auxiliary straps and more. DJI Mic Mini $99 (41 percent off): DJI's Mic Mini bundle includes two mic transmitters and a receiver that can be connected to a camera or phone, along with a charging case. The mics weigh just a third of an ounce and attach easily to subjects via magnets or clips. Everything pairs automatically and they offer high quality 24-bit 20Hz to 20K Hz recording. They also connect easily to smartphones over Bluetooth and other DJI devices like the Action 5 and Osmo Pocket 3 cams using DJI's OsmoAudio direct connection.

It can handle reading and writing at 1,700MB/s and 1,400MB/s respectively, enough speed for RAW video capture.

          "standfirst": "Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days is here, and you can save on all sorts of tech this time around. A mainstay of Prime Day sales, a pair of Blink Mini 2 cameras is on sale for only $35. That's 50 percent off, a record low and less than what you'd usually pay for one. It's also Engadget's pick for the best budget security camera. This budget-friend, wired camera is well-suited for nighttime video: It has a built-in LED spotlight, color night vision and a low-light sensor. Day or night, it records in sharp 1080p resolution. It also has a wider field of view than its predecessor. The Blink Mini 2 is primarily designed for indoor use. But you can use it outdoors, too. You'll just need to fork over $10 for a weather-resistant adapter. Wherever you use the camera, it works with Alexa and supports two-way audio. (\"Hello, doggy, I'll be home soon.\") It also supports person detection. (That's a neat feature that differentiates between people and other types of movement.) However, the feature requires a Blink Subscription Plan. They start at $3 per month or $30 per year for one device. The camera is available in black or white. Both colors are available for the $35 Prime Day deal, but they can't be mixed unless you buy each separately. It's worth noting that this deal is open to anyone — no Prime subscription necessary. Amazon recently announced an upgraded version of this camera that supports 2K video, but it won't be available until later in October. You can also save on a bunch of other Blink (and Ring) security gear for Prime Day. The Blink Outdoor 4 cameras are some of our favorites, and most configurations are on sale for Prime Day, including bundles like this three-camera system that's 61 percent off.

          "standfirst": "The Roku Streaming Stick Plus is on sale for just $24. That's a discount of 40 percent and the lowest we've ever seen it. Roku has held the top spot in the TV OS market for years thanks to its user-friendly interface, an affordable range of streaming devices and its own lineup of TVs. We picked the Streaming Stick Plus as the best streaming device for free and live content, thanks in large part to The Roku Channel app that accompanies it. The Roku Channel features over 500 free TV channels with live news, sports coverage and a rotating lineup of TV shows and movies. In our hands-on review of the Roku Streaming Stick Plus, we thought it was perfect for travel thanks to its small size and the fact that it can be powered by your TV's USB port, nixing the need for a wall adapter. Menu navigation and opening or closing apps won't happen at quite the same speeds as more expensive streamers, but it's quick enough for what is ultimately a pretty low-cost option. The Wi-Fi range on this one is also weaker than Roku's pricier devices, but unless you are placing it exceedingly far from your router, it shouldn't be an issue. The Roku Streaming Stick Plus supports both HD and 4K TVs, as well as HDR10+ content. It doesn't support Dolby Vision, however; for that you'll need to upgrade to Roku's Streaming Stick 4K or Roku Ultra. It comes with Roku's rechargeable voice remote with push-to-talk voice controls. Roku's remote can also turn on your TV and adjust the volume while you're watching. If you've been thinking about getting a Roku device, or you already love the platform and want a compact and convenient way to take it with you when you travel, then this sale provides a great opportunity. If you'd prefer a more powerful and slightly more stationary device, the Roku Ultra is on sale for $69 right now, too.

This deal is available on the 16GB model in Tungsten (dark grey) and doesn't include Kindle Unlimited. If you want more storage, the 32GB and 64GB versions are also 25 and 24 percent off, respectively. The Kindle Scribe is our pick for best e-reader E Ink tablet. It scored an 86 in our review, thanks to the smooth reading and writing experience it provides. We were also fans of its sleek and slender design. It has a 10.2-inch screen and offers front lights that auto-adjust to your needs. Our biggest gripe was the cost which, thanks to this deal, is less of an issue. It's worth noting that Amazon announced a few new Kindle Scribe models recently, but none of them are available just yet. The Kindle Scribe 3 has a thinner and lighter design, plus faster page-turning and writing experiences. The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft is Amazon's first full-color E Ink tablet. If you want the latest and greatest, it's worth it to wait — but Amazon hasn't yet named specific release dates for either new model. During its latest hardware event, it only said the new Scribes were coming \"later this year.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-second-gen-kindle-scribe-is-100-off-in-this-prime-day-deal-134701405.html?src=rss",

Shark makes some of our favorite robovacs and a few of them are already discounted for Prime members ahead of the sale. The Shark AV2501S AI Ultra robot vacuum is one of them, with a whopping 58-percent discount that brings it down to $230. This discount marks a record low for this model. Shark offers several variations of its AI Ultra robot vacuums. There are small variations between them, and a different model is our pick for the best robot vacuum for most people. In general, you can expect solid cleaning performance from these devices, along with accurate home mapping and an easy-to-use app. The model that's on sale here is said to run for up to 120 minutes on a single charge, which should be enough to clean an entire floor in a typical home. The self-emptying, bagless vacuum can store up to 30 days worth of dirt and debris in its base. Shark says it can capture 99.97 percent of dust and allergens with the help of HEPA filtration. If you'd rather plump for a model that's able to mop your floors too, you're in luck: a Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 vacuum is on sale as well. At $300 for Prime members, this vacuum is available for $400 (or 57 percent) off the list price. Its mopping function can scrub hard floors 100 times per minute. You can also trigger the Matrix Mop function in the app for a deeper clean. This delivers 50 percent better stain cleaning in targeted zones, according to Shark.

          "standfirst": "OpenAI launched an agent builder that the company hopes will eliminate fragmented tools and make it easier for enterprises to utilize OpenAI’s system to create agents. AgentKit, announced during OpenAI’s DevDay in San Francisco, enables developers and enterprises to build agents and add chat capabilities in one place, potentially competing with platforms like Zapier. By offering a more streamlined way to create agents, OpenAI advances further into becoming a full-stack application provider.“Until now, building agents meant juggling fragmented tools—complex orchestration with no versioning, custom connectors, manual eval pipelines, prompt tuning, and weeks of frontend work before launch,” the company said in a blog post. AgentKit includes:Agent Builder, which is a visual canvas where devs can see what they’ve created and versioning multi-agent workflowsConnector Registry is a central area for admins to manage connections across OpenAI products. A Global Admin console will be a prerequisite to using this feature.ChatKit enables users to integrate chat-based agents into their user interfaces. Eventually, OpenAI said it will build a standalone Workflows API and add agent deployment tabs to ChatGPT. OpenAI also expanded evaluation for agents, adding capabilities such as datasets with automated graders and annotations, trace grading that runs end-to-end assessments of workflows, automated prompt optimization, and support for third-party agent measurement tools. Developers can access some features of AgentKit, but OpenAI is gradually rolling out additional features, such as Agent Builder. Currently, Agent Builder is available in beta, while ChatKit and new evaluation capabilities are generally available. Connector Registry “is beginning its beta rollout to some API and ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu users. OpenAI said pricing for AgentKit tools will be included in the standard API model pricing. Agent BuilderTo clarify, many agents are built using OpenAI’s models; however, enterprises often access GPT-5 through other platforms to create their own agents. However, AgentKit brings enterprises more into its ecosystem, ensuring they don’t need to tap other platforms as often. Demonstrated during DevDay, the company stated that Agent Builder is ideal for rapid iteration. It also provides developers with visibility into how the agents are working. During the demo, an OpenAI developer made an agent that reads the DevDay agenda and suggests panels to watch. It took her just under eight minutes. Other model providers saw the importance of offering developer toolkits to build agents to entice enterprises to use more of their tools. Google came out with its Agent Development Kit in April, expanding multi-agent system building “in under 100 lines of code.” Microsoft, which runs the popular agent framework AutoGen, announced it is bringing agent creation to one place with its new Agent Framework.OpenAI customers, such as the fintech company Ramp, stated in a blog post that its teams were able to build a procurement agent in a few hours instead of months. “Agent Builder transformed what once took months of complex orchestration, custom code, and manual optimizations into just a couple of hours. The visual canvas keeps product, legal, and engineering on the same page, slashing iteration cycles by 70% and getting an agent live in two sprints rather than two quarters,” Ramp said. AgentKit’s Connector Registry would also enable enterprises to manage and maintain data across workspaces, consolidating data sources into a single panel that spans both ChatGPT and the API. It will have pre-built connectors to Dropbox, Google Drive, SharePoint and Microsoft Teams. It also supports third-party MCP servers. Another capability of Agent Builder is Guardrails, an open-source safety layer that protects against the leakage of personally identifiable information (PII), jailbreaks, and unintended or malicious behavior.Bringing more chat Since most agentic interactions involve chat, it makes sense to simplify the process for developers to set up chat interfaces and connect them with the agents they’ve just built. “Deploying chat UIs for agents can be surprisingly complex—handling streaming responses, managing threads, showing the model thinking and designing engaging in-chat experiences,” OpenAI said. The company said ChatKit makes it simple to embed chat agents on platforms and embed these into apps or websites. However, some OpenAI competitors have begun thinking beyond the chatbot and want to offer agentic interactions that feel more seamless. Google’s asynchronous coding agent, Jules, has introduced a new feature that enables users to interact with the agent through the command-line interface, eliminating the need to open a chat window. Responses The response to AgentKit has mainly been positive, with some developers noting that while it simplifies agent building, it doesn’t mean that everyone can now build agents. Several developers view Agent Kit not as a Zapier killer, but rather as a tool that complements the pipeline. Zapier debuted a no-code tool for building AI agents and bots, called Zapier Central, in 2024.",

As a ChatGPT user, you can any access available third-party app by referencing it in your conversations with the chatbot. In the case of Spotify, for example, you can write “Spotify, make a playlist for my party this Friday.” The first time you mention an app in this way, you’ll be prompted to connect your account to ChatGPT. When working with Spotify, ChatGPT can make recommendations based on a mood, theme or a topic. The interface will eventually lead you to Spotify itself, where you can listen to what ChatGPT has created. “It’s early days, so while we might not be able to deliver on every request just yet, we’ll continue to build, refine, and improve the experience over the coming weeks and months,” Spotify says of the integration.OpenAI showed off other apps working inside of ChatGPT. For instance, an employee demoed Canva creating a few posters for a dog-walking business that they had talked to ChatGPT about starting. With today’s announcement, ChatGPT can connect to Canva, Coursera, Figma, Spotify and Zillow. In the coming weeks, DoorDash, OpenTable, Target and Uber will also work with the chatbot. And later this year, OpenAI says it will begin accepting app submissions for review and publication.

This feature allows the user to log-into their accounts on those external apps and bring all their information back into ChatGPT, and use the apps very similarly to how they already do outside of the chatbot, but now with the ability to ask ChatGPT to perform certain actions, analyze content, or go beyond what each app could offer on its own. You can direct Canva to make you slides based on a text description, ask Zillow for home listings in a certain area fitting certain requirements, or ask Coursera about a specific lesson&#x27;s content while dit plays on video, all from within ChatGPT — with many other apps also already offering their own connections (see below).\"This will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive and personalized, that you can chat with,\" Altman said.While the Apps SDK is available today in preview, OpenAI said it would not begin accepting new apps within ChatGPT or allow them to charge users until \"later this year.\"ChatGPT in-line app access is already rolling out to ChatGPT Free, Plus, Go and Pro users — outside of the European Union only for now — with Business, Enterprise, and Education tiers expected to receive access to the apps later this year.Built atop common MCP standardBuilt on the open source standard Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduced by rival Anthropic nearly a year ago, the Apps SDK gives third-party developers working independently or on behalf of enterprises large and small to connect selected data, \"trigger actions, and render a fully interactive UI [user interface]\" Altman explained during his introductory keynote speech. The Apps SDK includes a \"talking to apps\" feature that allows ChatGPT and the underlying GPT-5 or other \"o-series\" models piloting it underneath to obtain updated context from the third-party app or service, so the model \"always knows about exactly what you&#x27;re user is interacting with,\" according to another presenter and OpenAI engineer, Alexi Christakis.Developers can build apps that:appear inline in chat as lightweight cards or carouselsexpand to fullscreen for immersive tasks like maps, menus, or slidesuse picture-in-picture for live sessions such as video, games, or quizzesEach mode is designed to preserve ChatGPT’s minimal, conversational flow while adding interactivity and brand presence.Early integrations with Coursera, Canva, Zillow and more...Christakis showed off early integrations of external apps built atop the Apps SDK, including ones from e-learning company Coursera, cloud design software company Canva, and real estate listings and agent connections search engine, Zillow.Altman also announced Apps SDK integrations with additional partners not demoed officially during the keynote including: Booking.com, Expedia, Figma and Spotify and in documentation, said more upcoming partners are on deck: AllTrails, Peloton, OpenTable, Target, theFork, and Uber, representing lifestyle, commerce, and productivity categories.The Coursera demo included an example of how the user onboards to the external app, including a new login screen for the app (Coursera) that appears within the ChatGPT chat interface, activated simply by a text prompt from the user asking: \"Coursera can you teach me something about machine learning\"?Once logged in, the app launched within the chat interface, \"in line\" and can render anything from the web, including interactive elements like video. Christakis explained and showed the Apps SDK also supports \"picture-in-picture\" and \"fullscreen\" views, allowing the user to choose how to interact with it.When playing a Coursera video that appeared, he showed that it automatically pinned the video to the top of the screen so the user could keep watching it even as they continued to have a back-and-forth dialog in text with ChatGPT in the typical input/output prompts and responses below. Users can then ask ChatGPT about content appearing in the video without specifying exactly what was said, as the Agents SDK pipes the information on the backend, server-side, from the connected app to the underlying ChatGPT AI model. So \"can you explain more about what they&#x27;re saying right now\" will automatically surface the relevant portion of the video and provide that to the underlying AI model for it to analyze and respond to through text.In another example, Christakis opened an older, existing ChatGPT conversation he&#x27;d had about his siblings&#x27; dog walking business and resumed the conversation by asking another third-party app, Canva, to generate a poster using one of ChatGPT&#x27;s recommended business names, \"Walk This Wag,\" along with specific guidance about font choice (\"sans serif\") and overall coloration and style (\"bright and colorful.\")Instead of the user manually having to go and add all those specific elements to a Canva template, ChatGPT went and issued the commands and performed the actions on behalf of the user in the background.After a few minutes, ChatGPT responded with several poster designs generated directly within the Canva app, but displayed them all in the user&#x27;s ChatGPT chat session where they could see, review, enlarge and provide feedback or ask for adjustments on all of them.Christakis then asked for ChatGPT to turn one of the slides into an entire slide deck so the founders of the dog walking business could present it to investors, which did it in the background over several minutes while he presented a final integrated app, Zillow.He started a new chat session and asked a simple question: \"based on our conversations, what would be a good city to expand the dog walking business.\"Using ChatGPT&#x27;s optional memory feature, it referenced the dog walk conversation and suggested Pittsburgh, which Christakis used as a chance to type in \"Zillow\" and \"show me some homes for sale there,\" which called up an interactive map from Zillow with homes for sale and prices listed and hover-over animations, all in-line within ChatGPT.Clicking a specific home also opened a fullscreen view with \"most of the Zillow experience,\" entirely without leaving ChatGPT, including the ability to request home tours and contact agents and filtering by bedrooms and other qualities like outdoor space. ChatGPT pulls up the requested filtered Zillow search as well as provides a text-based response in-line explaining what it did and why.The user can then ask follow-up questions about the specific property — such as \"how close is it to a dog park?\" — or compare it to other properties, all within ChatGPT.It can also use apps in conjunction with its Search function, searching the web to compare the app information (in this case, Zillow) with other sources.Safety, privacy, and developer standardsOpenAI emphasized that apps must comply with strict privacy, safety, and content standards to be listed in the ChatGPT directory. Apps must:serve a clear and valuable purposebe predictable and reliable in behaviorbe safe for general audiences, including teens aged 13–17respect user privacy and limit data collection to only what’s necessaryEvery app must also include a clear, published privacy policy, obtain user consent before connecting, and identify any actions that modify external data (e.g., posting, sending, uploading).Apps violating OpenAI’s usage policies, crashing frequently, or misrepresenting their capabilities may be removed at any time. Developers must submit from verified accounts, provide customer support contacts, and maintain their apps for stability and compliance.OpenAI also published developer design guidelines, outlining how apps should look, sound, and behave. They must follow ChatGPT’s visual system — including consistent color palettes, typography, spacing, and iconography — and maintain accessibility standards such as alt text and readable contrast ratios.Partners can show brand logos and accent colors but not alter ChatGPT’s core interface or use promotional language. Apps should remain “conversational, intelligent, simple, responsive, and accessible,” according to the documentation.A new conversational app ecosystemBy opening ChatGPT to third-party apps and payments, OpenAI is taking a major step toward transforming ChatGPT from a chatbot into a full-fledged AI operating system — one that combines conversational intelligence, rich interfaces, and embedded commerce.For developers, that means direct access to over 800 million ChatGPT users, who can discover apps “at the right time” through natural conversation — whether planning trips, learning, or shopping.For users, it means a new generation of apps you can chat with — where a single interface helps you book a flight, design a slide deck, or learn a new skill without ever leaving ChatGPT.As OpenAI put it: “This is just the start of apps in ChatGPT, bringing new utility to users and new opportunities for developers.”There remain a few big questions, namely: 1. what happens to all the data from those third-party apps as they interface with ChatGPT and its users...does OpenAI get access to it and can it train upon it? 2. What happens to OpenAI&#x27;s once much-hyped GPT Store, which had been in the past promoted as a way for third-party creators and developers to create custom, task-specific versions of ChatGPT and make money on them through a usage-based revenue share model?We&#x27;ve asked the company about both issues and will update when we hear back.",

          "title": "Evernote's biggest update since 2020 goes all in on AI",
          "standfirst": "If you're like me, it's probably been a hot minute since you've thought about Evernote. For years, the note-taking app, once a darling of the App Store, faced declining popularity and profitability. The last time it grabbed headlines was in 2022 when it was sold to Milan-based developer Bending Spoons. Approximately nine months later, Bending Spoons laid off nearly all of Evernote's US workforce, and relocated what remained of the company's operations to Europe. Now, Evernote wants to be in the conversation again. Since taking over the app, Bending Spoons has released more than 200 improvements, culminating today with the release of Evernote v11. The company is touting the update, which is the first major release for Evernote since its poorly received v10 release back in 2020. The new version brings a handful of new AI features to Evernote, including one that Bending Spoons collaborated with OpenAI to develop. \"My wish for v11 is that people give it a try and see how fast and reliable it is, how complete it is in what it offers,\" Federico Simionato, Evenote's product lead, said over a video chat. \"I think people have an outdated opinion of Evernote that used to match reality, when Evernote was slow and unreliable.\" The first of the new features Bending Spoons is introducing today is called AI Assistant. Simionato describes it as having ChatGPT inside of Evernote. No surprise since the company collaborated with OpenAI to make it. As you can probably guess, you can use AI Assistant to search through your notes and notebooks, but the tool's utility goes beyond that. It allows you to interact with your documents and ask follow-up questions. AI Assistant can also generate new content, and you can decide how what it creates is integrated within your existing notes and notebooks. In my demo, Simionato used AI Assistant to add a flight ticket number to a note he had dedicated to an upcoming trip to Spain. Over time, Bending Spoons plans to make AI Assistant more powerful, with the company working on making it possible for the chatbot to assign tags to notes and perform bulk actions across multiple documents, among other capabilities. By default, Bending Spoons will enable AI Assistant for all paid users. A set of granular controls will allow people to decide what content AI Assistant can access. The agreement Bending Spoons has with OpenAI means the company can't train its models on data from Evernote users. Additionally, any data sent to the cloud for processing will only be held as long it takes to complete the user's request. Part of the reason Bending Spoons is taking a more forward approach with AI Assistant is due to user feedback. In 2023, the company released a tool called AI Search. Simionato says his team was \"extremely careful\" to add friction to the experience to ensure people felt Evernote was respecting their privacy. To that end, you had to dig into the app's settings to enable AI Search before it would work. According to Simionato, users found that setup was \"too cumbersome,\" and with most people becoming more comfortable with AI tools, the company decided to make AI Assistant visible from the jump. The other new feature Bending Spoons is introducing today is one some Evernote users have been waiting for a decade: Semantic Search. Instead of trying to find a note using an exact word or phrase you used inside of it, Semantic Search allows Evernote to filter through your documents using context. Simionato demonstrates the feature in action by typing \"Barcelona trip\" into the new interface, and Evernote surfaces a note he created about a trip to Girona. If you're not familiar, Girona is a city about 62 miles northeast of Barcelona and part of Catalonia. The document Evernote pulled up had no mention of Barcelona in it, but that didn't prevent the tool from finding it. According to Simionato, this is the most requested feature of longtime Evernote users and one Bending Spoons is happy it can finally deliver on. Lastly, the company has expanded the app's built-in recording and transcription capabilities. Building on AI Transcribe, which Bending Spoons first introduced in 2024, Evernote can now record audio from both in-person and online meetings and automatically transcribe and summarize what's said. This feature should work in every language that Evernote currently supports. As mentioned, Evernote's new AI features are available to all paid users. The features will roll out to desktop and web first starting this month, with mobile to follow. Simionato said Bending Spoons is working on making a trail available to free users sometime in the next few months. For now, the price of Evernote's paid plans isn't going up, but Simionato noted the company plans to adjust pricing in the coming months, mostly to account for the fact there aren't many notable differences between the Personal and Professional tiers.

          "standfirst": "Last week, Amazon announced two new Echo Show devices during its fall hardware event. From the stage, Amazon execs repeatedly used the phrase “blend into the background.” Amazon hardware chief Panos Panay told a personal story, recounting how Alexa+ was able to “shift the balance” at his dinner table, supplying his family with facts to settle their mealtime debates, no phones required. He praised the fact that Alexa+ can help \"without distracting you” or “taking you away from what’s most important.” Laudable sentiment, for sure. It’s jarring to be ripped away from a moment by uninvited tech. So if the folks at Amazon really believe Alexa-enabled tech should fade into the background, they may agree that when I’m in my kitchen slicing an apple for my kid and I glance up at my Echo Show cycling through family photos, it’s really frickin distracting when the shot of the forested field just outside my old house is replaced by a full-screen advertisement for Dewalt drill bits. It sure as heckfire takes me out of the moment. My Echo Show does not “fade into the background;” it sticks ads in my face. I don’t remember it always being this way. I can recall a time, maybe a year or so ago, when my Echo Show 15 happily cycled through my photos with no billboard pop-ups. An Amazon rep I spoke with assured me that advertising has always been a part of the Echo Show experience, though they were less clear as to whether or not there may have been a change to the way ads were served on the home screen and photo carousel. That year-or-so-timeline jibes with what I’m seeing on Reddit and Amazon’s help pages. From one to two years ago, complaints started popping up. People were suddenly confronted with ads and hoping, in vain, that someone could explain how to turn them off. The posts ranged from confusion to disbelief, to irritation and infuriation — exactly the emotional range I experienced when a cereal ad popped up (coincidentally?) while I was making breakfast. I, like those hopeful redditors, wondered whether there was a secret setting, some buried menu option that would offer escape from the march of commerce while I washed the dishes. So I double checked with the Amazon rep and had it unequivocally confirmed: There is no way to turn these ads off. I get it. From the printing press to AI chatbots, ads have always been inseparable from technology. My very paycheck depends, in part, on that airline/insurance/PC banner over there on your screen. I accept that I must first close the Old Spice pop up to read an article on Deadline. I tolerate the pillow commercial on YouTube so I can watch Josh Johnson ruminate. I begrudgingly agree to these things; they’re part of the contract. But a billboard in my kitchen? Family vacation pics interspersed with Moen faucet promos? That’s not something I agreed to. I shouldn’t have to suffer through an ad so I can watch content if the content is my own damn pictures and the home page of a machine I paid hundreds of dollars to own. Built-in ads don't even subsidize the cost of an Echo Show like they do with Kindles — buying one of Amazon’s ereaders with lockscreen ads at least knocks $20 off the price. If, as we were told last week, Alexa+ and its vessels are supposed to fade into the background, if we’re meant to invite this AI into our homes, into our kitchens, to our dinner tables, as a distraction-free helper, then un-opt-outable ads on the Echo Show home screen are not aligned with that goal. I’ve unplugged my Echo Show 15. Soon I’ll delete my data from it and stick it on the sidewalk with a big free sign on it. If you’re in the neighborhood, you’re welcome to pick it up.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/dont-buy-an-echo-show-you-can-have-mine-155730401.html?src=rss",

An Amazon rep I spoke with assured me that advertising has always been a part of the Echo Show experience, though they were less clear as to whether or not there may have been a change to the way ads were served on the home screen and photo carousel. That year-or-so-timeline jibes with what I’m seeing on Reddit and Amazon’s help pages. From one to two years ago, complaints started popping up. People were suddenly confronted with ads and hoping, in vain, that someone could explain how to turn them off. The posts ranged from confusion to disbelief, to irritation and infuriation — exactly the emotional range I experienced when a cereal ad popped up (coincidentally?) while I was making breakfast. I, like those hopeful redditors, wondered whether there was a secret setting, some buried menu option that would offer escape from the march of commerce while I washed the dishes. So I double checked with the Amazon rep and had it unequivocally confirmed: There is no way to turn these ads off. I get it. From the printing press to AI chatbots, ads have always been inseparable from technology. My very paycheck depends, in part, on that airline/insurance/PC banner over there on your screen. I accept that I must first close the Old Spice pop up to read an article on Deadline. I tolerate the pillow commercial on YouTube so I can watch Josh Johnson ruminate. I begrudgingly agree to these things; they’re part of the contract. But a billboard in my kitchen? Family vacation pics interspersed with Moen faucet promos? That’s not something I agreed to. I shouldn’t have to suffer through an ad so I can watch content if the content is my own damn pictures and the home page of a machine I paid hundreds of dollars to own. Built-in ads don't even subsidize the cost of an Echo Show like they do with Kindles — buying one of Amazon’s ereaders with lockscreen ads at least knocks $20 off the price. If, as we were told last week, Alexa+ and its vessels are supposed to fade into the background, if we’re meant to invite this AI into our homes, into our kitchens, to our dinner tables, as a distraction-free helper, then un-opt-outable ads on the Echo Show home screen are not aligned with that goal. I’ve unplugged my Echo Show 15. Soon I’ll delete my data from it and stick it on the sidewalk with a big free sign on it. If you’re in the neighborhood, you’re welcome to pick it up.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/dont-buy-an-echo-show-you-can-have-mine-155730401.html?src=rss",

Right now, the Logitech MX Master 4 is available at Best Buy for $90, down from $120. The 25 percent markdown is the first deal we've seen on the device. The MX Master 4 comes three years after its predecessor (and our pick for best wireless mouse of 2025), the MX Master 3S. We tested the latest iteration for a few weeks and it still has all the comfort of the 3S, despite being slightly heftier. Plus, it has a lightly textured plastic on top, rather than the rubber on the 3S. The main difference between the two is the MX Master 4's haptic feedback. It's built into the thumb rest panel and you can change the intensity or turn it off through Logitech’s Options+ software. You'll feel it at times such as when pairing the mouse, the battery is low or you've perfectly lined up a graphic in Photoshop. However, on that note, right now haptics only work with apps like Photoshop, Lightroom and Zoom, with Adobe Premiere Pro coming soon. If you plan to use Photoshop, Lightroom and the like, then buying the mouse from Best Buy is a good choice. The store is exclusively offering customers two complimentary months of an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription when you buy the MX Master 4.

          "standfirst": "The story of the Rabbit R1 is a cautionary tale. The AI gadget stole CES 2024, thanks in large part to its cutesy design and Rabbit's promise that it could do nearly everything a smartphone could without being a distraction. At least that was the pitch. When it finally arrived a few months later, with buggy software and a laundry list of features that simply didn't work, the backlash was swift. Engadget's Devindra Hardawar called the R1 \"a $199 AI toy that fails at almost everything.\" In a video with nearly 9 million views, YouTuber Marques Brownlee said the R1 was barely reviewable. That same backlash extended to Humane, Rabbit's one-time rival, which this past February effectively went out of business after selling its intellectual property to HP for $116 million and discontinuing support for the much-maligned AI Pin. Nearly two years later, Rabbit is still here, having recently released its most significant software update yet with RabbitOS 2. \"We want to take this opportunity to ask people for a second chance,\" Jesse Lyu, the CEO of Rabbit.Having used the R1 in its original state, RabbitOS 2 is a significant improvement. At launch, the touchscreen didn't work like it does on a smartphone. This made doing something simple like accessing the settings menu an absolute chore. With OS 2, Rabbit has redesigned the device's interface around colorful cards, making it much easier to see what it can actually do. The display now finally functions like a regular touchscreen, allowing you to navigate the interface with taps and swipes, instead of a complicated series of presses involving the side button. Other quality of life tweaks also make the device feel more useful. For example, the R1 can now transcribe voice memos without an internet connection. Then there's the update's marquee feature: Creations. Creations are an evolution of Teach mode, a tool Rabbit introduced toward the end of last year. They allow you to vibe code your own apps to use with the R1. The process of making Creations feels a lot less clunky than it did with Teach mode. To start, you describe the app you want R1 to create, then your device will ask a series of clarifying questions to get a better idea of what you want. Intern, the AI agent that handles coding the apps, has a comprehensive knowledge of R1's hardware, so there's no need to get bogged down in technical details. With Lyu's help, I made a tuning app for my guitar. The entire process took about five minutes, and the result, I'll admit, felt novel in a way I hadn't experienced in a while. The tuner not only worked, but I was able to tell the coding agent exactly how I wanted it to look and function, with the AI offering helpful suggestions to guide the process. Did I want the app to use a needle interface? Yes, I said. What color should the interface be? The R1's signature orange, I told it. Granted, there are countless tuning apps out there, but it felt cool that I had some hand in deciding how this one should look and work. I also appreciate some of the Creations others have made. There's one that offers an interactive map of Hollow Knight: Silksong's Pharloom that has been my companion through the latter parts of the game. As far as Lyu is concerned, Creations are the killer feature the R1 has been missing since launch, offering something no smartphone on the market can quite yet match. He's particularly excited about the system Rabbit has devised for distributing them. There's no traditional app store like you might find on an Android or iOS device; instead, users can share their apps through Rabbithole (Rabbit's online R1 hub) or using a QR code. Still, Lyu admits there are things Rabbit needs to figure out before it can convince people to throw out their phones. \"The biggest barrier [to R1 adoption] is no one wants to carry around two devices. We know that, and there are a lot of things on the phone, whether you're using an iPhone or Android, that users don't trust an AI to handle,\" he said. Here, Lyu is primarily thinking of banking apps. Banking regulation being what it is, there's probably no future where you'll be able to vibe code an app to access your Chase account, but Lyu is hopeful consumer demand will eventually lead to financial institutions embracing Rabbit and the R1. Either way, he's adamant that Creations are the way forward for the company. \"This is still the right thing for us to do,\" he tells me. \"If you look at how you built your tuner app versus how somebody would build and sell their tuner app on the App Store, that's a completely different generational experience. You did zero coding. You just talk to your R1 and distribute.\" I wonder if that's enough. The ability to create your own apps will be compelling to some people, but I imagine most just want software that works without the hassle of making it themselves. Besides, there's more to software development than just putting an app out into the world. Arguably the more difficult (and important) part of the job is maintaining an app, ensuring it works for you and other people. AI systems are getting better at coding every day, but they still make mistakes, and having some coding knowledge makes it a lot easier to fix those errors. Some smartphone experiences will also be harder to replicate than others. One Creation allows you to stream music to the R1 from YouTube Music, but the software is so basic compared to the official app on Android and iOS. Rabbit has shared documentation on GitHub to help program Creations that can access other third-party services, but I wonder how quickly people will lose interest in vibe coding all but the most basic apps. And for all its faults, the app store model offers a way for developers to earn a living off their work. People can upload their Creations to Rabbit's website, but the only party making money on the concept is Rabbit — at the moment there's no infrastructure in place to charge money for Creations, assuming anyone would want to. Creations also consume Intern tasks, and those aren't exactly cheap. You can buy three for $30 or pay $70 per month for a monthly allowance of 30. Of course, the question most people have is the same one that has dogged Rabbit and the R1 from the start: \"Why can't this just be an app?\" Lyu contends Creations are one part of the answer. \"I don't think we're going to see an iPhone-like moment this year or next year. Starting in 2027, that's when the generational shift will happen. In that sense, we're not in a rush to do something major.\" When I asked why 2027, Rabbit declined to share more, but something Lyu said about the prospect of competing against OpenAI gave me a hint of the company's plans. If you need a refresher, OpenAI announced in May it was buying former Apple design chief Jony Ive's hardware startup for $6.5 billion, with the ambition of releasing its own AI device. \"From what I know about Jony and OpenAI, I don't think they're going to be interested in a second gadget like R1,\" Lyu said (he knows Sam Altman personally, having gone through Y-Combination when Altman was president of the startup accelerator from 2014 to 2019). \"I think they're going to focus on a phone-like factor. That's a much bigger audience. But by 2027, everyone is going to be making phones.\" When I later asked if a phone was in Rabbit's future, a company spokesperson declined to elaborate on Lyu's comments. \"We’ve been working on many different prototypes and form factors, but don’t have any specific details to share.\" For now, the company appears to be squarely focused on improving its software. \"The focus this year is on rebirth,\" Lyu told me. \"And to keep pioneering things no else is doing in the industry.\" The challenge for Rabbit will not only be staying ahead of OpenAI, but all the existing phone manufacturers adding AI features to their devices. Just earlier this week, Nothing, a smaller player in the space, announced Essential Apps, a tool people can use to vibe code apps for the company's phones. If Nothing is successful, how long will it be before Samsung and Google do the same?This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/rabbit-plots-its-redemption-arc-120000271.html?src=rss",

          "standfirst": "A good webcam makes a big difference whether you’re jumping on work calls, streaming gameplay or catching up with friends across the country. Built-in laptop cameras often fall short, so investing in one of the best webcams gives you sharper video, better colors and features like background control or low-light correction.The market is full of options at different prices, which makes picking the right one tricky. Some focus on 4K resolution while others prioritize smooth frame rates or strong microphones. This guide rounds up the best webcams you can buy right now so you can find one that matches your setup and needs. Table of contents Best webcams for 2025 Factors to consider before buying a webcam How we test webcams Other webcams we tested Best webcams for 2025 Factors to consider before buying a webcam Resolution and field of view While some newer computers have 1080p webcams, most built-in cameras have a resolution of 720p, so you’ll want to look for an external webcam that has a higher resolution. FHD webcams will give you better video quality; ideally, you’re looking for something that can handle 1080p at 60fps or 30fps. If you’re considering a cheap 720p webcam, make sure to get one that supports at least 30fps (most will) or, even better, 60fps. However, if your primary concern is better picture quality during video calls, 1080p is the way to go. Some webcams can shoot in 4K, but that’s overkill for most people. Not to mention most video conferencing services like Zoom, Google Meet and Skype don’t even support 4K video. When it comes to streaming, Twitch maxes out at 1080p video, but YouTube added 4K live streaming back in 2016. Ultimately, with 4K webcam shots having such limited use, most people can get by with a solid 1080p camera. Field of view (FOV) controls how much can fit in the frame when you’re recording. Most webcams I tested had a default field of view of around 78 degrees, which captured me and enough of my background to prove that I really need to organize my home office. On cheaper webcams you’ll usually see narrower fields of view (around 60 degrees), and those aren’t necessarily bad. They won’t show as much of your background, but that also means you won’t be able to squeeze as many friends or family members into frame when you’re having Zoom birthday parties. On the flip side, more expensive webcams may let you adjust the field of view to be even wider than average, and some even offer features like digital zoom. Autofocus and other “auto” features Webcams with autofocus will keep the image quality sharp without much work on your part. You should be able to move around, step back and forth, and remain in focus the whole time. Some standalone webcam models let you manually adjust focus, too, if you have specific needs. Devices with fixed focus are less convenient, but they tend to be more affordable. In the same vein is auto framing, a feature that some high-end webcams now offer. Similarly to Apple’s Center Stage feature, the camera automatically adjusts to keep you in the center of the frame even as you move around. This used to be a feature only available on the most premium webcams, but now you can find it on sub-$200 devices. You’ll also see other “auto” features listed in webcam specs, most notably auto light correction. This will adjust the camera’s settings to make up for a dimly lit room. If you don’t have bright lights, or often take calls in places where you can’t control the lighting, this feature will be valuable. Alternatively, you might consider using your mirrorless camera as a high-quality webcam solution, taking all of the benefits and features with you (albeit in a cumbersome package). Microphones Most webcams have built-in microphones that, depending on your setup, might end up being closer to you than your computer’s own mics. Check to see if the model you’re considering has mono or stereo mics, as the latter is better. Some even use noise-reduction technology to keep your voice loud and clear. While audiophiles and streamers will want to invest in a standalone microphone, most others can get by using a webcam’s built-in mic. Design There aren’t a ton of fascinating breakthroughs when it comes to external webcam design. Most are round or rectangular devices that clip onto a monitor or your laptop screen. Some have the ability to swivel or screw onto a tripod stand and others can simply sit on your desk beside your computer. But unless you really like having people stare up your nose, the latter isn’t ideal. We recommend clipping your webcam to your monitor and ensuring that it’s at or slightly above eye level. A few webcams go above and beyond by adding hardware extras like built-in lights and lens covers, too. The former can help you stand out in a dark room, while the latter makes it so hackers can’t view you through your webcam without your knowledge. Price Most external webcams that are just good enough to be a step up from your computer’s built-in camera cost between $60 and $150. If the webcam has the same resolution as the internal one on your laptop, you should look out for other specs like auto light correction, a wider field of view or an extra-long connecting cable that can provide a step-up in quality or ease of use. Spending $150 or more means you might get advanced features that tend to be present in a pro webcam like 4K resolution, vertical and horizontal recording options, stereo mics, customizable video settings and more. But unless you’re spending hours on video calls each day or streaming multiple times each week, you can settle on a budget webcam and safely skip most of those high-end options. How we test webcams We primarily test webcams by putting them through as much real-world use as possible. We examine their design, how flexible they are and how easy they are to reposition, and make note of how heavy they are and if that affects their ability to stay put while sitting on top of a screen. We use each webcam for at least a week straight as our primary camera for all video chats, and we make sure to use the device in different lighting environments to test low-light performance. We also use any built-in microphones as our primary audio inputs on video calls as well. Finally, although most of these webcams are plug-and-play, we test out any proprietary software that’s intended to work with each webcam, tweaking things like field of view, video resolution and effects, and using any special features like Show Mode on Logitech webcams. Others webcams we tested Logitech C920s Pro HD Our previous top pick, the Logitech C920s Pro HD webcam remains a solid option for those with less than $100 to spend and really only need a basic 1080p camera to upgrade their setup, or something affordable to make them look better on those inevitable Zoom calls. It has a 78-degree field of view, decent microphones and handy privacy shutter built in. The Brio 500 took the top spot away from this model thanks to its advanced light correction, auto-framing and Show Mode. Webcam FAQs Should I get a 4K or 1080p webcam? It depends on how you plan to use it. A 1080p webcam is more than enough for most video calls, online classes and casual streaming. The picture looks clear, loads quickly and works well even on slower internet connections. A 4K webcam makes sense if you want sharper detail, especially for content creation, professional streaming or recordings you plan to upload. The extra resolution also helps if you crop or zoom in during a call without losing much quality. Keep in mind that 4K requires more bandwidth and not every platform supports it, so think about whether your setup and audience will benefit before spending more.

          "content": "A good webcam makes a big difference whether you’re jumping on work calls, streaming gameplay or catching up with friends across the country. Built-in laptop cameras often fall short, so investing in one of the best webcams gives you sharper video, better colors and features like background control or low-light correction.The market is full of options at different prices, which makes picking the right one tricky. Some focus on 4K resolution while others prioritize smooth frame rates or strong microphones. This guide rounds up the best webcams you can buy right now so you can find one that matches your setup and needs. Table of contents Best webcams for 2025 Factors to consider before buying a webcam How we test webcams Other webcams we tested Best webcams for 2025 Factors to consider before buying a webcam Resolution and field of view While some newer computers have 1080p webcams, most built-in cameras have a resolution of 720p, so you’ll want to look for an external webcam that has a higher resolution. FHD webcams will give you better video quality; ideally, you’re looking for something that can handle 1080p at 60fps or 30fps. If you’re considering a cheap 720p webcam, make sure to get one that supports at least 30fps (most will) or, even better, 60fps. However, if your primary concern is better picture quality during video calls, 1080p is the way to go. Some webcams can shoot in 4K, but that’s overkill for most people. Not to mention most video conferencing services like Zoom, Google Meet and Skype don’t even support 4K video. When it comes to streaming, Twitch maxes out at 1080p video, but YouTube added 4K live streaming back in 2016. Ultimately, with 4K webcam shots having such limited use, most people can get by with a solid 1080p camera. Field of view (FOV) controls how much can fit in the frame when you’re recording. Most webcams I tested had a default field of view of around 78 degrees, which captured me and enough of my background to prove that I really need to organize my home office. On cheaper webcams you’ll usually see narrower fields of view (around 60 degrees), and those aren’t necessarily bad. They won’t show as much of your background, but that also means you won’t be able to squeeze as many friends or family members into frame when you’re having Zoom birthday parties. On the flip side, more expensive webcams may let you adjust the field of view to be even wider than average, and some even offer features like digital zoom. Autofocus and other “auto” features Webcams with autofocus will keep the image quality sharp without much work on your part. You should be able to move around, step back and forth, and remain in focus the whole time. Some standalone webcam models let you manually adjust focus, too, if you have specific needs. Devices with fixed focus are less convenient, but they tend to be more affordable. In the same vein is auto framing, a feature that some high-end webcams now offer. Similarly to Apple’s Center Stage feature, the camera automatically adjusts to keep you in the center of the frame even as you move around. This used to be a feature only available on the most premium webcams, but now you can find it on sub-$200 devices. You’ll also see other “auto” features listed in webcam specs, most notably auto light correction. This will adjust the camera’s settings to make up for a dimly lit room. If you don’t have bright lights, or often take calls in places where you can’t control the lighting, this feature will be valuable. Alternatively, you might consider using your mirrorless camera as a high-quality webcam solution, taking all of the benefits and features with you (albeit in a cumbersome package). Microphones Most webcams have built-in microphones that, depending on your setup, might end up being closer to you than your computer’s own mics. Check to see if the model you’re considering has mono or stereo mics, as the latter is better. Some even use noise-reduction technology to keep your voice loud and clear. While audiophiles and streamers will want to invest in a standalone microphone, most others can get by using a webcam’s built-in mic. Design There aren’t a ton of fascinating breakthroughs when it comes to external webcam design. Most are round or rectangular devices that clip onto a monitor or your laptop screen. Some have the ability to swivel or screw onto a tripod stand and others can simply sit on your desk beside your computer. But unless you really like having people stare up your nose, the latter isn’t ideal. We recommend clipping your webcam to your monitor and ensuring that it’s at or slightly above eye level. A few webcams go above and beyond by adding hardware extras like built-in lights and lens covers, too. The former can help you stand out in a dark room, while the latter makes it so hackers can’t view you through your webcam without your knowledge. Price Most external webcams that are just good enough to be a step up from your computer’s built-in camera cost between $60 and $150. If the webcam has the same resolution as the internal one on your laptop, you should look out for other specs like auto light correction, a wider field of view or an extra-long connecting cable that can provide a step-up in quality or ease of use.

          "standfirst": "When I write about the cognitive migration now underway, brought about by the rapid advance of gen AI, I do so from the perspective of someone who has spent four decades in the technology industry. My own journey runs from coding business applications in Fortran and COBOL to systems analysis and design, IT project management, enterprise systems consulting, computing hardware sales and technology industry communications. All of it has been centered in the U.S., although I have collaborated with colleagues and clients across Europe and Asia.My writing carries an American, tech-industry vantage point, although I make attempts to see a broader perspective. Perhaps that is fitting, since much of the frontier development of AI remains clustered in Silicon Valley, Seattle, Boston and a handful of other Western hubs. But how does this migration look beyond America’s borders? For millions in the Global South, cognitive migration is less about the loss of white-collar prestige and more about the chance to leapfrog into new opportunities.This divide is visible in the data. The 2025 Edelman Trust Barometer found that fewer than one in three Americans feel comfortable with businesses using AI, while in India, Indonesia and Nigeria nearly two-thirds express comfort. In the West, AI may be perceived to threaten job loss and displacement, and this view may be warranted. A study by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that 60% of jobs in advanced economies are exposed to the impact of AI due to the prevalence of cognitive-task-oriented jobs. The Wall Street Journal quoted Ford CEO Jim Farley: “AI will leave a lot of white-collar people behind.”In the Global South, however, AI is often perceived as an opportunity to improve education, strengthen healthcare, modernize agriculture and drive development. One analysis argues that for the Global South, “AI holds tangible promise for nations historically excluded from the benefits of previous industrial revolutions.” Perhaps this explains the findings reported by Academia.edu that Global North newspapers publish more negative AI headlines, while Global South outlets emphasize opportunity. Yet the story is not so simple. Even where the potential for advancement is emphasized, there is often also worry about loss of work, ethics, algorithmic bias, access and technical capacity. As with earlier waves of globalization, gains and risks will be distributed unevenly.AI as opportunityThere is a strong positive narrative around AI in the Global South, with many hopeful stories and promising results. In Nigeria, a World Bank-funded after-school tutoring program that used AI to tailor lessons to individual students produced striking results with nearly two years of learning gains in just six weeks. For communities with few qualified teachers, such gains are not incremental improvements. They can transform futures. Healthcare applications provide comparable stories. In India, Boston Consulting Group reports that AI diagnostic tools are being deployed in rural clinics with few doctors, offering screenings for conditions such as breast cancer or tuberculosis that might otherwise go undetected. These tools extend the reach of limited health resources and help detect conditions before it is too late.The use of AI in agriculture also shows promise. In Kenya, the PlantVillage Nuru app developed with Penn State University uses AI to detect crop diseases through farmers’ smartphones, equipping them to spot and treat threats to their harvests early. For households that depend on subsistence farming, such tools can mean the difference between security and scarcity.Yet many of these breakthroughs rely on Northern institutions, creating benefits but also exposing a fragile dependency. When outside funding or partnerships end, local efforts can stall. In this sense, leapfrogging risks being built on borrowed foundations.Taken together, these examples illustrate why many in the Global South see AI as a chance to transform trajectories rather than repeat old patterns. Yet optimism tells only part of the story. Alongside these gains are deep structural challenges that complicate the journey, reminding us that this migration, like all others, carries benefits that include hidden costs.Barriers to progressResearch also shows that AI adoption across the Global South is hindered by persistent gaps in infrastructure, data, skills and governance. Availability of reliable electricity and broadband remains uneven, local datasets are often scarce or biased and many countries face shortages of trained professionals to develop and oversee AI systems. Without strong regulatory frameworks, societies are also more exposed to privacy risks, exploitative labor practices and algorithmic bias. These realities mean that while AI holds promise as a development pathway, it can also deepen inequality if its benefits concentrate in urban centers and among elites, while leaving rural communities behind.So why do surveys of trust show higher comfort with AI in the Global South than in the West? One explanation lies in expectations. In the U.S. and Europe, AI is often perceived as a threat to stable jobs and established professions. In Nigeria, India or Indonesia, by contrast, it is more likely to be framed as a tool for closing persistent gaps. Media narratives often reinforce the divergence in expectations. In the West, headlines emphasize automation anxiety, while in the Global South, AI is more often described as a development pathway. Add to this the fact that many people in the Global South report higher levels of trust in institutions overall, and the disparity begins to make sense. The same technology intersects with different baselines, diverse needs, distinct cultures and different stories, which shape whether AI is welcomed with suspicion or with hope. Yet beyond these perceptual differences lie material realities that complicate the optimistic narrative, particularly in how global AI development distributes both its benefits and its burdens.Hidden costsEvery migration carries costs alongside gains, and the story of AI in the Global South is no different. While the overall AI narrative in the Global South leans positive, many celebrated breakthroughs depend on large workforces doing essential yet hidden tasks. Data annotation and content review are indispensable to the global AI economy, but the work is repetitive, emotionally taxing and poorly paid relative to the value it creates.Other sectors face pressure from a different direction. In India and the Philippines, business process outsourcing and call centers employ millions of workers who support global clients. These roles depend on language, routine cognitive tasks and customer service, the very areas where AI chatbots and automated platforms are advancing fastest.The shift is not immediate, but workers in these industries are already questioning whether the migration now underway will carry them forward or leave them behind. Is cognitive migration a single global phenomenon, or are we witnessing multiple migrations that only appear connected?Many routes, shared destinationIs this the same cognitive migration unfolding everywhere, or are there separate journeys? On the surface, the story looks divided. In the U.S. and Europe, professionals worry about displacement from stable careers and a risk to their lifestyles. In India, Nigeria and Indonesia, AI is often presented as a chance to accelerate development and fill long-standing gaps. These appear to be distinct migrations.Yet, the reality is more entangled. The story of AI in the Global South is not simply one of catching up, just as the story in the West is not simply one of decline. Migration is never only progress or only loss. It is both, with something gained and something given up. For teachers in Nigeria, the gain may be students advancing at unprecedented speed. For call center workers in India, the loss may be jobs once thought secure. For farmers in Kenya, the gain may be healthier crops and steadier harvests. For professionals in Europe or the United States, the loss may be careers reshaped or diminished by automation.This variability in experience is not because AI technology is somehow different in one area or another, but because the lived experiences are diverse. The same systems can seem empowering in one place and threatening in another. An uneven passageWhat lies ahead is still uncertain. But if migration teaches anything, it is that adaptation requires not only resilience but imagination. The task is not to deny what is lost or to celebrate only what is gained, but to recognize both and design wisely for what comes next.This migration is not unfolding along a single path. It is fractured and revealing. The starting points differ, the routes are uneven, and the burdens are not equally shared. In the Global South, AI is often seen as a lever for progress, not a threat to status. But beneath the promise lie the same risks we face everywhere, including extraction without investment, automation without inclusion, innovation without safeguards and deployment without trust. These are not side effects. They are signals. If we ignore them, the cognitive future will be one more story written by the few for the few. As Indonesian policy advisor Tuhu Nugraha has argued in Modern Diplomacy: “As concerns rise globally about AI’s unchecked development potentially destabilizing economies or social cohesion, models from the Global South that emphasize inclusion, trust and reflection can help mitigate those risks before they explode into global backlash.” His warning reinforces the point that inclusion and trust must be part of the design of AI advancement and not assumed.If we pay attention, the Global South may offer not just caution but clarity. The choice is not only whether to design wisely, but whose experience we treat as essential when we do. Because in the end, cognitive migration is not regional. It is a worldwide passage, and how we navigate it together will shape not just the future of AI, but the future of being human.Gary Grossman is EVP of technology practice at Edelman.",

          "title": "Stopping breaches at machine speed demands agents, not alerts",
          "standfirst": "Presented by DXC TechnologyThe sheer volume and sophistication of incoming threats today has dwarfed attacks from just six months ago, let alone two years ago, because adversaries have leveled up with AI. Naturally, security operations and analysts are under pressure, facing mounting alert volumes and false positives, while organizations scramble to support them amidst a widening talent gap and an old model that doesn&#x27;t stand up, says Chris Drumgoole, president, global infrastructure services at DXC Technology.\"The traditional, linear SOC [Security Operations Center] method was built very much like the rest of information technology service management — ticket, investigate threat — but the math just doesn’t add up given the volume,\" Drumgoole says. \"You would need a SOC bigger than your customer call center just to deal with all the incoming tickets. And that pure volume question is coupled with the increasing sophistication of tools and attacks. When you put those things in a blender, you end up with an old model that doesn’t work anymore.\"To combat alert fatigue and slow investigation cycles, organizations are fighting fire with fire: agentic security, or intelligent AI agents, that are capable of independently triaging, investigating, and responding to incidents at scale. DXC has partnered with 7AI to launch DXC Agentic Security Operations Center (SOC) integrating fully autonomous AI agents into its end-to-end managed security operations. But before rolling this out globally to customers, DXC put the technology to the test, Drumgoole adds, using 7AI&#x27;s agentic platform to optimize its own internal SOC capabilities. They immediately saw an 80% reduction in tier-1 SOC analyst time and a 95% reduction in the number of tickets that humans must analyze, which means a 67% reduction in mean time to respond in the tier-1 and tier-2 SOC. A category shift, not an incremental update This isn&#x27;t just upgraded automation, but a major shift in threat response, analogous to the earlier shift from static defense to dynamic response. Agentic security isn&#x27;t rule-based — it&#x27;s adaptive, contextual, and end-to-end. And though humans will stay in the loop over the long term, agentic AI has the potential to move from reactive triage to proactive, self-directed defense.\"The real difference is that the AI model gives every alert the side eye, so to speak,\" Drumgoole says. \"While automation responds to the same alert the same way every time, the AI agent approaches each situation uniquely, recognizes the nuances and can learn from what it saw the last time and the time before. What we expect from our new Agentic SOC is going to be evolutionarily different just in terms of the amount they handle and how fast they handle it going forward.\"DXC Agentic SOC eliminates the traditional bottlenecks of manual alert processing, expecting to save customers 30 minutes to 2.5 hours per investigation by reducing false positive rates that can consume analyst resources. Average response time has gone from about 74 minutes to 24 minutes, a 70% improvement over the average human capability. \"The data speaks for itself. The math is the math,\" Drumgoole says. \"In the first 40 days of running our own Agentic SOC, we saved 165 human days of analyst work time. It’s only going up from there.An evolve-or-die momentEven though the math speaks for itself in terms of accuracy, many organizations are still nervous about AI in general, and in particular, relying on it to transform their processes. Most workflows are built around humans, and bringing AI into the mix means disrupting that workflow, which adds time and material costs, and even takes an emotional toll. \"That’s a big adjustment for people,\" Drumgoole says. \"It’s really not a technical barrier, but an emotional, operational, and process barrier, underlined by &#x27;this is the way we’ve always done it&#x27; thinking.\"But according to Drumgoole, it’s an evolve-or-die moment, and organizations need to push through the uncertainty. The mandate has to come from the top level, with executive-level sponsorship and clear mission. The beauty of the solution is that it&#x27;s straightforward to implement and easy to scale, because it doesn&#x27;t need to be considered a technology transformation, necessarily. Instead, it should be treated as equivalent to adding a stable of tier-1 security analysts. It doesn&#x27;t require data storage or access to personal information, just needs to have the same security and access controls that an analyst would.\"Those who embrace it will grow their business,\" he explains. \"The more you can invest in training your agents, in building and deploying them, the better they’re going to get.

          "content": "Presented by DXC TechnologyThe sheer volume and sophistication of incoming threats today has dwarfed attacks from just six months ago, let alone two years ago, because adversaries have leveled up with AI. Naturally, security operations and analysts are under pressure, facing mounting alert volumes and false positives, while organizations scramble to support them amidst a widening talent gap and an old model that doesn&#x27;t stand up, says Chris Drumgoole, president, global infrastructure services at DXC Technology.\"The traditional, linear SOC [Security Operations Center] method was built very much like the rest of information technology service management — ticket, investigate threat — but the math just doesn’t add up given the volume,\" Drumgoole says. \"You would need a SOC bigger than your customer call center just to deal with all the incoming tickets. And that pure volume question is coupled with the increasing sophistication of tools and attacks. When you put those things in a blender, you end up with an old model that doesn’t work anymore.\"To combat alert fatigue and slow investigation cycles, organizations are fighting fire with fire: agentic security, or intelligent AI agents, that are capable of independently triaging, investigating, and responding to incidents at scale. DXC has partnered with 7AI to launch DXC Agentic Security Operations Center (SOC) integrating fully autonomous AI agents into its end-to-end managed security operations. But before rolling this out globally to customers, DXC put the technology to the test, Drumgoole adds, using 7AI&#x27;s agentic platform to optimize its own internal SOC capabilities. They immediately saw an 80% reduction in tier-1 SOC analyst time and a 95% reduction in the number of tickets that humans must analyze, which means a 67% reduction in mean time to respond in the tier-1 and tier-2 SOC. A category shift, not an incremental update This isn&#x27;t just upgraded automation, but a major shift in threat response, analogous to the earlier shift from static defense to dynamic response. Agentic security isn&#x27;t rule-based — it&#x27;s adaptive, contextual, and end-to-end. And though humans will stay in the loop over the long term, agentic AI has the potential to move from reactive triage to proactive, self-directed defense.\"The real difference is that the AI model gives every alert the side eye, so to speak,\" Drumgoole says. \"While automation responds to the same alert the same way every time, the AI agent approaches each situation uniquely, recognizes the nuances and can learn from what it saw the last time and the time before. What we expect from our new Agentic SOC is going to be evolutionarily different just in terms of the amount they handle and how fast they handle it going forward.\"DXC Agentic SOC eliminates the traditional bottlenecks of manual alert processing, expecting to save customers 30 minutes to 2.5 hours per investigation by reducing false positive rates that can consume analyst resources. Average response time has gone from about 74 minutes to 24 minutes, a 70% improvement over the average human capability. \"The data speaks for itself. The math is the math,\" Drumgoole says. \"In the first 40 days of running our own Agentic SOC, we saved 165 human days of analyst work time. It’s only going up from there.An evolve-or-die momentEven though the math speaks for itself in terms of accuracy, many organizations are still nervous about AI in general, and in particular, relying on it to transform their processes. Most workflows are built around humans, and bringing AI into the mix means disrupting that workflow, which adds time and material costs, and even takes an emotional toll. \"That’s a big adjustment for people,\" Drumgoole says. \"It’s really not a technical barrier, but an emotional, operational, and process barrier, underlined by &#x27;this is the way we’ve always done it&#x27; thinking.\"But according to Drumgoole, it’s an evolve-or-die moment, and organizations need to push through the uncertainty. The mandate has to come from the top level, with executive-level sponsorship and clear mission. The beauty of the solution is that it&#x27;s straightforward to implement and easy to scale, because it doesn&#x27;t need to be considered a technology transformation, necessarily. Instead, it should be treated as equivalent to adding a stable of tier-1 security analysts. It doesn&#x27;t require data storage or access to personal information, just needs to have the same security and access controls that an analyst would.\"Those who embrace it will grow their business,\" he explains. \"The more you can invest in training your agents, in building and deploying them, the better they’re going to get. I think if you don’t, you’re going to find yourself a dinosaur real fast.\" Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

Those specialized cells—regulatory T cells—are now well established as playing a key role in peripheral immune tolerance. That is, a non-central process that allows the immune system to strike a delicate balance between being appropriately responsive and aggressive toward intruding germs or foreign dangers while also not running amok. Before the trio of prize winners came along, researchers thought that such immune tolerance occurred centrally, in the thymus, the primary lymphoid organ that sits in the center of the chest. There, T cells mature, including into two key types: T helper cells, which go on to trigger immune responses when they recognize foreign dangers; and the aptly named T killer cells, which kill cells, including foreign cells, cancer cells, and cells infected by a virus.Read full article Comments",

The SDK is built on the open source Model Context Protocol (MCP), Altman said. That means developers that already use MCP only need to add an HTML resource to enable ChatGPT integration, he added. The new integration means a ChatGPT user can directly ask Figma to turn a sketch into a diagram, for instance, and get results integrated into their ChatGPT conversation. It also means that ChatGPT can suggest apps that might be suited to a more general query, like recommending and creating a Spotify playlist when someone asks for song suggestions.Read full article Comments",

Shin is the first author of a new study in Nature Neuroscience that has identified a specific population of neurons in the visual cortex—dubbed IC-encoders—and shows their direct role in representing a visual illusion. The work is the result of a collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley, the Allen Institute in Seattle, and Seoul National University. What the brain “knows” Illusory contours are edges we see even though they aren’t physically there. A classic example is the Kanizsa triangle: three “Pac-Man” shapes make us perceive a bright white triangle floating on top. Hide the Pac-Men with your fingers and the trick is revealed: There is no border, just a uniform background. Neurophysiology agrees with perception here: For over 20 years, studies in primates and later imaging in humans and mice have described neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas that respond to real and illusory contours.

At night, the brilliant white ribbon of racetrack throws the rest of the surroundings into darkness. Unlike a Le Mans car, there are no headlights in F1. Just over 1,600 lights are needed for the job, which got underway in mid-June. They're LED now, a switch made in 2023 that cut energy consumption by a noticeable 30 percent. The light itself is even carefully tuned—a color of 5,700 K and a color rendering index of 90 best replicate daylight for the drivers. Oh, and there can't be any flickering that could affect the TV broadcast. The results look spectacular, especially in 4K. As for the racing this year? Perhaps not so much. Past Singaporean Grands Prix have tended to be action-packed—or even chaotic. In the inaugural 2008 race, Red Bull came away convinced that electromagnetic interference from an underground train line caused the failure of one of its race cars, as well as a sister car belonging to the team we now call Racing Bulls. Other teams remained worried about this phenomenon as late as 2015, although no similar failures had been recorded. For the record, Singapore's Land Transit Authority says there was no train track below the relevant corner of the circuit—the nearest train tunnel is more than 600 feet away (200 m) and 32 feet (10 m) below ground level.Read full article Comments",

The San Francisco-based startup run by Sam Altman acquired the former Apple design chief’s company io for $6.5 billion in May, but the pair have shared few details on the projects they are building. Their aim is to create a palm-sized device without a screen that can take audio and visual cues from the physical environment and respond to users’ requests.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "SpaceX's $17 billion deal to buy spectrum licenses from EchoStar should help Starlink satellites deliver better service to smartphones, and it might give a few large corporations second thoughts about their current partnerships with Starlink competitors. The spectrum, combined with a SpaceX plan to launch up to 15,000 new and improved satellites for cellular service, could cause AT&T and Verizon to question their reliance on satellite company AST SpaceMobile. Apple, which was reportedly already facing internal dissent over its deal with Globalstar, now has another reason to wonder if it made the right choice in rejecting an offer from Elon Musk. Pending regulatory approval, SpaceX will acquire EchoStar's AWS-4 and H-block spectrum licenses, giving Musk's space company the rights to 50 MHz of spectrum in the 1.9 and lower 2 GHz spectrum bands. SpaceX plans to acquire EchoStar's rights to the spectrum in the US and globally.Read full article Comments",

          "content": "In 1915, intrepid British explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton and his crew were stranded for months in the Antarctic after their ship, Endurance, was trapped by pack ice, eventually sinking into the freezing depths of the Weddell Sea. Miraculously, the entire crew survived. The prevailing popular narrative surrounding the famous voyage features two key assumptions: that Endurance was the strongest polar ship of its time, and that the ship ultimately sank after ice tore away the rudder. However, a fresh analysis reveals that Endurance would have sunk even with an intact rudder; it was crushed by the cumulative compressive forces of the Antarctic ice with no single cause for the sinking. Furthermore, the ship wasn't designed to withstand those forces, and Shackleton was likely well aware of that fact, according to a new paper published in the journal Polar Record. Yet he chose to embark on the risky voyage anyway. Author Jukka Tuhkuri of Aalto University is a polar explorer and one of the leading researchers on ice worldwide. He was among the scientists on the Endurance22 mission that discovered the Endurance shipwreck in 2022, documented in a 2024 National Geographic documentary. The ship was in pristine condition partly because of the lack of wood-eating microbes in those waters. In fact, the Endurance22 expedition's exploration director, Mensun Bound, told The New York Times at the time that the shipwreck was the finest example he's ever seen; Endurance was \"in a brilliant state of preservation.\"Read full article Comments",
