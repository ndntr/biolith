The facades of landmarks were turning into countdown clocks presenting a light show at midnight.Temple bells rang across Japan, and some people climbed mountains to see the year&#x27;s first sunrise. Others were eating noodles in a traditional wish for long life because of the noodle&#x27;s shape.

The Berlin TV Tower was nearly invisible thanks to the falling flakes and fog.Greece and Cyprus were turning down the volume, replacing traditional fireworks with low-noise pyrotechnics, light shows and drone displays in capital cities. Officials said the change is intended to make celebrations more welcoming for children and pets, particularly animals sensitive to loud noise.Police in New York City will have additional anti-terrorism measures at the Times Square ball drop, with \"mobile screening teams\". It is not in response to a specific threat, according to NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch.After the ball drops it will rise again, sparkling in red, white and blue, to mark the country&#x27;s upcoming 250th birthday.Zohran Mamdani will take office as mayor at the start of 2026. Two swearing-in ceremonies are planned, starting with a private ceremonial event about midnight in an old subway station.",

They&#x27;d just be so proud of you both.\"While this is the first time Camilla has spoken publicly about the attack she experienced, it was previously recounted in the book \"Power and the Palace,\" published earlier this year by Valentine Low, a former royal correspondent for the Times of London.That account was based on what the queen told former Prime Minister Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London.According to Low&#x27;s book, Camilla was on a train to London&#x27;s Paddington Station when the man sitting next to her reached out and attempted to touch her.She fought him off by removing her shoe and bashing him in the groin. When she got to Paddington she found a man in uniform and told him what had happened, and the man was arrested.Support is available from the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service at 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732).DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
