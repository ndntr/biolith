Todd told 9News the family was relieved the results meant her body could be released back to her family in Canada.Todd also said he and his wife Angela had been invited to attend an Indigenous smoking ceremony on K&#x27;gari, which they said they would be honoured to accept.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
