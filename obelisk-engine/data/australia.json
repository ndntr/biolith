I was not even physically present when it apparently took place,\" Prestia said, in a statement issued by Richmond in October.\"I deny that I am guilty of these offences and will strenuously defend these charges.\"Melbourne said May had advised them he was not involved and he would \"strongly defend\" the charge in court.Both AFL clubs are supportive of the players.Prestia is a three-time premiership player with Richmond, and won the club&#x27;s best-and-fairest award in 2019.May played for Melbourne in the 2021 premiership and is a dual All-Australian player.",

Saryazdi has a Master of Mathematical Sciences from the University of Sydney, according to his online profiles.He also described himself as a PhD candidate with the CSIRO data and digital specialist arm and Australian Centre for Robotics.Saryazdi intended to make national news and bring people together with attention to his disenchantment with the government, his Legal Aid solicitor Hellen Shilton said.He had a very isolated lifestyle and lost contact with his parents since moving interstate to Brisbane, she said.\"He became influenced a bit by the new people he associated with. He was watching videos of protests,\" Shilton said.\"He admits he became quite overwhelmed emotionally. He felt he should do something with the way the world was going ... it was never his intention to hurt anyone.\"At the point of allegedly purchasing the alcohol and other items, reality started to sink in and he had made silly choices about his cause, his solicitor said.\"He has never taken part in any protests, he is obviously misguided,\" Shilton said.Saryazdi&#x27;s argument for bail appeared at odds with his statements to police, magistrate Penelope Hay said.\"Contrary to admissions he made that he intended to throw a Molotov cocktail in a public place on Australia Day and overthrow the government?\" she said.Hay denied Saryazdi bail due to the apparent strength of the prosecution case and his alleged serious link to violent offending.He was remanded in custody and is due to face court again on February 20.",
