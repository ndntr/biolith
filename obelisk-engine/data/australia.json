As well as arguing that recognition is immoral, critics argue that it&#x27;s an empty gesture given that the Palestinian people are divided into two territories — the West Bank and Gaza — with no recognized international capital.Starmer has insisted that Hamas will have no role in the future of the governance of the Palestinian people and must release the Israeli hostages it still holds from the attacks on Oct. 7, 2023.READ MORE: &#x27;Guilty as hell&#x27;: Trump turns on his attorney general in extraordinary spray Historical overlayFrance and the UK have a historic role in the politics of the Middle East over the past 100 years, having carved up the region following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I.As part of that carve-up, the UK became the governing power of what was then Palestine. It was also author of the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which backed the establishment of a “national home for the Jewish people.”However, the second part of the declaration has been largely neglected over the decades. It noted “that nothing shall be done, nothing which may prejudice the civil and religious rights” of the Palestinian people.Lammy, who will represent the UK at the UN this week, said in July that this had not been upheld and represented “a historical injustice which continues to unfold.”The Palestinian head of mission in the UK Husam Zomlot told the BBC that recognition would right a colonial-era wrong.“The issue today is ending the denial of our existence that started 108 years ago, in 1917,” he said.And I think today, the British people should celebrate a day when history is being corrected, when wrongs are being righted, when recognition of the wrongs of the past are beginning to be corrected.\"Change of tackThe UK has for decades supported an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, but insisted recognition must come as part of a peace plan to achieve a two-state solution.READ MORE: Simone tried to dial triple zero six times after her husband collapsed However, the government has become increasingly worried that such a solution is becoming all but impossible – not only because of the razing of Gaza and displacement of most of its population during nearly two years of conflict, but because Israel’s government is aggressively expanding settlements in the West Bank, land Palestinians want for their future state.Much of the world regards Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, which is ostensibly run by the Palestinian Authority, as illegal.“We are working to reform the Palestinian Authority, and we have to keep two states alive for the children of both Gaza and the West Bank and East Jerusalem,\" said Lammy.Israel kills 34 people in Gaza, say health officialsIsraeli strikes killed at least 34 people in Gaza City overnight, including children, said health officials on Sunday, as Israel presses ahead with its offensive in the famine-stricken city and several countries prepare to recognize a Palestinian state.Health officials at Shifa Hospital, where most of the bodies were brought, said the dead included 14 people killed in a late-night strike om Saturday, which hit a residential block in the southern side of the city.Health staff said a nurse who worked at the hospital was among the dead, along with his wife and three children.Israel did not comment on the strikes.The latest Israeli operation, which began this week, further escalates a conflict that has roiled the Middle East and likely pushes any ceasefire further out of reach.The Israeli military, which has told Palestinians to leave, hasn&#x27;t given a timeline for the offensive, but there were indications it could take months. Israel says the operation is meant to pressure Hamas into freeing hostages and surrendering.",
