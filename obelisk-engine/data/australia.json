          "content": "Fire safety inspections hadn&#x27;t been carried out since 2019 at the Swiss bar where a fire at a New Year&#x27;s party left 40 people dead and over 100 injured, local authorities said on Tuesday.Investigators have said they believe sparkling candles atop Champagne bottles ignited the fire at Le Constellation in the resort town of Crans-Montana when they came too close to the ceiling. Authorities are looking into whether soundproofing material on the ceiling conformed with regulations and whether the candles were permitted for use in the bar.READ MORE: Danish PM says US takeover of Greenland would be the end of NATO Swiss authorities have opened a criminal investigation into the bar managers. The two are suspected of involuntary homicide, involuntary bodily harm and involuntarily causing a fire, according to the Valais region&#x27;s chief prosecutor.The regulations in Valais call for annual fire safety inspections of buildings that are \"accessible to the public,\" and regional authorities say they are the responsibility of the municipality. On Tuesday, the Crans-Montana municipality said that inspections of Le Constellation that included fire safety checks had been carried out in 2016, 2018 and 2019, and that modifications had been requested — but no issues with soundproofing measures had been raised.The local council discovered after consulting documents after the fire that \"periodic checks were not carried out between 2020 and 2025,\" the head of Crans-Montana&#x27;s municipal government, Nicolas Féraud, told a news conference.\"We regret this bitterly,\" he said, adding that it will be up to judicial authorities to determine what influence that may have had on the events that led to the fire.Féraud said he couldn&#x27;t immediately explain why safety inspections hadn&#x27;t been conducted for such a long time.Féraud said that, in September last year, an external expert had been asked to carry out a soundproofing analysis and had concluded that the bar complied with anti-noise rules, without making further remarks.The severity of burns made it difficult to identify some victims of the fire that broke out at about 1.30am on New Year&#x27;s Day, requiring families to supply authorities with DNA samples.Investigators finished identifying the 40 dead on Sunday and said on Monday that they had identified all 116 people who were injured, from several countries.On Monday, the Paris prosecutor&#x27;s office announced that it was opening a probe to assist the Swiss investigation and make it easier for families of French victims to communicate with Swiss investigators. Nine French citizens were killed, the youngest 14, and 23 were injured.Féraud said reports from the inspections that were carried out mentioned a maximum capacity of 100 people on the bar&#x27;s ground floor and 100 in its basement. It&#x27;s unclear how many people were in Le Constellation when the blaze broke out and investigators have said that may never be known.The municipality said the bar&#x27;s owner obtained a permit to build a veranda in 2015 and also carried out interior work at the bar that did not require a permit.It said it has now decided to ban the use of fireworks indoors and commission an external agency to carry out inspections of such establishments.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "NSW&#x27;s public assembly restriction has been extended due to safety concerns following the terror attack at Bondi Beach last month.After the state rushed through new laws, Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon was given the power to temporarily restrict protests from public areas on December 24.He has reviewed the 14-day declaration and has extended it again until January 20 due to heightened fear within the community.READ MORE: Aboriginal mother of five named after dying in outback prison cell\"I have decided that the holding of public assemblies for the next 14 days has the potential to cause fear and public safety issues,\" he said.\"This is not about stopping free speech. It&#x27;s about making sure that the community has time to feel safe.\" During the initial 14 days, there was a protest held for Venezuela on Sunday following US President Donald Trump&#x27;s capture of Nicolas Maduro.A protester who wore a jacket with the phrase \"globalise the intifada\" was arrested and later released without charge.The renewed declaration means police will not accept any form 1 applications for protests in the South West Metropolitan, North West Metropolitan and Central Metropolitan policing areas.While gatherings are still allowed, anyone who causes obstructions to roads, businesses or others, behaves in an intimidating or harassing manner or causes fear in others can be ordered to move on.Anyone who fails to do so can be charged with an offence. Police also have the power to require anyone suspected of committing an offence to remove any face coverings. The declaration is in place for 14 days at a time.The NSW Police Commissioner has the power to extend the declaration for up to three months. READ MORE: Police declare &#x27;major crime&#x27; after suspicious disappearance of motherA coalition of protest groups has planned to hold a \" Genocide is a crime, Protest is Not\" rally amid the latest declaration in Sydney on January 16.Lanyon said he would assess the behaviour at any unauthorised protests and the community sentiment when the 14 days are up to determine whether to extend the declaration after January 20. \"We will consider all of those factors. It is very premature to talk about what may happen post these 14 days,\" he said.\"I&#x27;m constantly looking at the community and working very closely with the community to understand the fear and the level of comfort within the community.\"My job is to ensure public safety.\"Police Minister Yasmin Catley said police had the full support of the government.\"The NSW government unequivocally supports the commissioner&#x27;s decision and remains committed to ensuring NSW Police have the powers, resources and backing they need to keep the community safe.\" The new powers have been criticised by demonstrators and civil rights groups, who argue the rules impede the democratic right to protest. The Stop the War on Palestine group has condemned Lanyon&#x27;s decision today to extend the declaration.\"It is blatantly obvious that the ban has nothing to do with &#x27;social cohesion&#x27; and everything to do with removing democratic rights to oppose government policy and genocide,\" the group said in a statement.
