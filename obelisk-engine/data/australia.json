Almost 70 neo-Nazis from the White Australia organisation were armed with a banner that read \"Abolish the Jewish Lobby\" yesterday, using the NSW state parliament as the stage for their protest.The neo-Nazis applied to protest ahead of time, made clear their intention to rally against Jewish groups and were given the green light by police 10 days ago.READ MORE: &#x27;Straight into the eye&#x27;: Girl, 12, hospitalised after magpie swoopNationals leader David Littleproud described the incident as \"disgraceful\" and said the rally was a stark reminder of the kind of hatred still being perpetrated in plain sight.\"It is disgraceful. And these sorts of animals shouldn&#x27;t be allowed on the streets to chant that sort of hate,\" Littleproud said.\"They&#x27;re trying to import hate from overseas into this country, and we&#x27;re better than that.\"Littleproud said the protest should never have taken place and called for laws to respond to the troubling neo-Nazi movement. \"There was a mistake by the police and someone should pay a price for that,\" he added.\"I think obviously there&#x27;ll be learnings. It&#x27;s a reminder that these people are still there, they still want to perpetrate this hate.\"We have to be vigilant, not just as legislators or institutions, but as Australians.\"NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon and NSW Premier Chris Minns yesterday confirmed they had no idea it was going ahead.\"I take it very personally, there was a communication error within the police force for which I did not personally know that today&#x27;s protest was taking place,\" Lanyon said.\"Accordingly, I had not briefed the minister of police or government.\"Minns also pointed to new legislation to stop it from happening again.\"It&#x27;s obviously shameful that these people feel that they have the right to demonstrate in such a despicable, hateful way, spewing division and racism on the streets of Sydney,\" Minns said.Police are reviewing the footage to determine whether any hate speech crimes were committed.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "A Russian drone has slammed into an apartment building in eastern Ukraine while many were sleeping, killing three people and wounding 12 others, Ukrainian authorities reported.The Saturday morning attack in Dnipro, Ukraine’s fourth-largest city, was part of a large Russian missile and drone barrage across the country that targeted power infrastructure.It also killed a worker at an energy company in Kharkiv, farther north, a local official said.READ MORE: Aussies like Cassie resorting to selling their clothes to make ends meet A fire broke out and several apartments were destroyed in the nine-story building in Dnipro, the emergency services said.Rescuers recovered the bodies of three people, while two children were among the wounded.Russia fired a total of 458 drones and 45 missiles, including 32 ballistic missiles.Ukrainian forces shot down and neutralised 406 drones and nine missiles, the air force said, adding that 25 locations were struck.Authorities switched off power in several regions because of the attacks, Ukrainian Energy Minister Svitlana Grynchuk said in a post on Facebook.In eastern Ukraine, fighting for the strategic city of Pokrovsk has reached a key stage, with both Kyiv and Moscow vying to persuade US President Donald Trump that they can win on the battlefield.Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that work has begun on President Vladimir Putin’s order to prepare plans for a possible Russian nuclear test, according to state news agency Tass.Putin’s order on Wednesday followed statements by Trump, which appeared to suggest that Washington would restart its own atomic tests for the first time in three decades.READ MORE: Grieving husband&#x27;s powerful message after Brisbane mum killed in motorbike crashEnergy sites attackedRussia has been pummeling Ukraine with near-daily drone and missile strikes, killing and wounding civilians.The Kremlin says its only targets are linked to Kyiv’s war effort.Russia&#x27;s Defence Ministry asserted Saturday that the nighttime strikes hit military and energy sites supplying Ukrainian forces.Moscow and Kyiv have traded almost daily assaults on each other’s energy targets as US-led diplomatic efforts to stop the nearly four-year war had no impact on the battlefield.Ukraine’s long-range drone strikes on Russian refineries aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue the war.Russia wants to cripple the Ukrainian power grid and deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Kyiv officials say is an attempt to “weaponise winter”.Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said in an X post that the strikes damaged “several major energy facilities” around Kharkiv and Kyiv, as well as in the central Poltava region.READ MORE: Man accused of stealing luxury car and going for a joyridehttps://x.com/Svyrydenko_Y/status/1987085470589653452Thermal power plants operated by Ukraine’s state energy company Centrenergo were again knocked offline by the nighttime strikes, the company said in a statement Saturday.Centrenergo&#x27;s three plants in Kyiv, Kharkiv and Donetsk regions were damaged by Russian attacks last year and subsequently restored.Russian forces, meanwhile, repelled a “massive” nighttime strike on energy facilities in the southern Volgograd region, Governor Andrei Bocharov said on Saturday, two days after Ukraine said that it hit a key oil refinery there with long-range drones.Bocharov added that the strike knocked out power in parts of the region&#x27;s northwest, but caused no casualties.There was no immediate comment from Kyiv.Russia&#x27;s Defence Ministry said on Saturday that its forces shot down 82 Ukrainian drones during the night, including eight over the Volgograd region.Two people were wounded in the neighbouring Saratov region after a Ukrainian drone strike blew out windows in an apartment building, according to regional Governor Roman Busarin.READ MORE: Three men fight for life after being hit by car outside restaurant in SydneyRussian oilFollowing weeks of long-range strikes on Russia&#x27;s energy infrastructure that Ukraine says both funds and directly fuels the Kremlin&#x27;s war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed to “find a way to ensure there is no Russian oil in Europe”.Zelenskyy spoke to reporters shortly after Hungary secured a year-long exemption from recent US sanctions targeting major Russian oil producers.“We will not allow it. We will not let the Russians sell oil there. It’s a matter of time,\" he said at a news briefing after meeting with senior Ukrainian military leaders, without elaborating how Kyiv might seek to stanch the oil flows.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, a Trump ally who has long urged the European Union to repair ties with Moscow, argues that landlocked Hungary has no viable alternatives to Russian crude, and that replacing those supplies would trigger an economic collapse. Critics dispute that claim.The Trump administration unveiled sanctions against Russia’s major state-affiliated oil firms Rosneft and Lukoil last month, a move that could expose their foreign buyers – including customers in Central Europe, India and China – to secondary sanctions.While most of the EU&#x27;s 27 member states sharply reduced or halted imports of Russian fossil fuels after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, Hungary and Slovakia have maintained their pipeline deliveries.Hungary has even increased the share of Russian oil in its energy mix.Fighting for PokrovskThe city of Pokrovsk sits along the eastern front line, part of what has been dubbed the “fortress belt” of Donetsk, a line of heavily fortified cities crucial to Ukraine’s defence of the region.It could also be a key point in influencing Washington&#x27;s stance and sway the course of peace negotiations, analysts say.Russia troops advanced near Pokrovsk and the nearby town of Myrnohrad, according to the Russian Defence Ministry on Saturday, saying both were encircled.It also said Russian forces surrounded Ukrainian defenders in Kupiansk, a key railway hub in the northeastern Kharkiv region.Kyiv didn&#x27;t immediately respond to Moscow&#x27;s statements, which couldn&#x27;t be independently verified.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "US airlines again cancelled more than 1000 flights today, the second day of the Federal Aviation Administration’s order to reduce air traffic because of the government shutdown.So far, the slowdown at many of the nation’s busiest airports hasn’t caused widespread disruptions.But it has deepened the impact felt by what is now the nation’s longest federal shutdown.READ MORE: Russian strike kills four in Ukraine apartment while residents slept READ MORE: Aussies like Cassie resorting o selling their clothes to make ends meet “We all travel. We all have somewhere to be,” Emmy Holguin, 36, who was flying out of Miami to visit family in the Dominican Republic for the week, said.“I&#x27;m hoping that the government can take care of this.”Analysts warn that the upheaval will intensify and be felt far beyond air travel if the cancellations pick up and move closer to the Thanksgiving holiday.Already there are concerns about the impact on cities and businesses that rely on tourism and the possibility of shipping interruptions that could delay getting holiday items on store shelves.Here’s what to know about the flight reductions:How many flights have been cancelled?Both of the first two days of the FAA&#x27;s slowdown have seen more than 1000 flights cancelled, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks flight disruptions.On Saturday – typically a slow travel day – the airport serving Charlotte, North Carolina, was by far the hardest hit with 120 arriving and departing flights cancelled by midday.Airports in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, and Orlando, Florida, were among the others with the most disruptions. Staffing shortages in Charlotte and Newark, New Jersey, slowed traffic too.Not all the cancellations were due to the FAA order, and those numbers represent just a small portion of the overall flights nationwide.But they are certain to rise in the coming days if the slowdown continues.The FAA said the reductions impacting all commercial airlines are starting at 4 per cent of flights at 40 targeted airports and will be bumped up again on Tuesday before hitting 10 per cent of flights on Friday.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned this week that even more flight cuts might be needed if the government shutdown continues and more air traffic controllers are off the job.READ MORE: Grieving husband&#x27;s powerful message after Brisbane mum killed in motorbike crashWhy are the flights being cancelled?Air traffic controllers have gone without paychecks for nearly a month as the shutdown continues, leading many to call in sick and add to already existing staffing shortages.Most controllers are working mandatory overtime six days a week during the shutdown without pay, and some are taking second jobs to pay their bills, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association has said.How are passengers being affected?Most were relieved to find that airlines largely stayed on schedule on Friday, and those whose flights were called off were able to quickly rebook.So far, longer international flights haven&#x27;t been interrupted.There&#x27;s still a lot of uncertainty about what flights will be cancelled next.And not everyone has the means to pay for a hotel or deal with a last-minute disruption, said Heather Xu, 46, who was in Miami on Saturday after a cruise and flying home to Puerto Rico.“Travel is stressful enough. Then you put these disruptions in place and it really makes everything more challenging,” she said.Rental car companies reported a sharp increase in one-way reservations Friday, and some people are simply cancelling flights altogether.What could be the impacts beyond air travel?First, there&#x27;s the potential for higher prices in stores, as nearly half of all US air freight is shipped in the bellies of passenger aircraft.Major flight disruptions could bring higher shipping costs that get passed on to consumers, said Patrick Penfield, professor of supply chain practice at Syracuse University.More losses will ripple through the economy if the slowdown continues – from tourism to manufacturing, said Greg Raiff, chief executive of Elevate Aviation Group.“This shutdown is going to impact everything from cargo aircraft to people getting to business meetings to tourists being able to travel,\" he said.\"It’s going to hit the hotel taxes and city taxes. There’s a cascading effect that results from this thing.’’DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
