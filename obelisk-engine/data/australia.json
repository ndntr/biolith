If you come across an injured koala, you should pull off the road safely and call your local wildlife carer for instructions if possible.Always make sure it is safe before you go onto the road to attend to an animal and stop any traffic if necessary. Approach the animal carefully from behind and place a blanket over the koala, enclosing its arms and head.Be careful as the koala is frightened and has very sharp claws.Move the koala to a safe place away from any traffic, handle the animal as little as possible and keep the environment quiet until it arrives at a vet or with a wildlife carer.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

Today&#x27;s search was launched following a tip-off that a single gunshot was heard around 12.20pm on the day police officers Neal Thompson and Vadim De Waart-Hottart were shot dead on Freeman&#x27;s property at Porepunkah.Firearm testing was conducted in November in the vicinity of Barrett Lane and Rayner Track.This testing led police to identify additional search locations in the ongoing manhunt.\" This week we are here to conduct an ongoing search based on that information,\" Tilley said.This week&#x27;s search will span 1.3 square kilometres, which is around 52 football fields in size. Police, search and rescue volunteers, members of the dog squad and drone squad will join the five-day search, expected to end on Friday.\"Weather is on their side but it will be extremely challenging,\" Tilley said, noting the search may be hampered by difficult terrain and thick bush.Mount Buffalo National Park has already been the focus of police activity in the hunt for Freeman, with a five-day search undertaken in part of the park last December.Thompson and De Waart-Hottart were shot dead when officers were executing a search warrant on Freeman&#x27;s property as part of an investigation by the Wangaratta Sexual Offences and Child Abuse Investigation Team.A third police officer was seriously wounded and continues to recover.
