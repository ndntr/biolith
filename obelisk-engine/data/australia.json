          "content": "Dual-code rugby star Wendell Sailor has spent a night in custody after allegedly being found blocking traffic in the middle of a busy road in a bizarre incident.The 51-year-old former Australian league and union international was arrested after police received reports of a man yelling and standing in the middle of the road in Wollongong about 11pm on Friday.He was allegedly stopping traffic near a busy intersection not far from the city centre while apparently under the influence of drugs or alcohol.READ MORE: Sydney&#x27;s first heatwave this Summer has authorities on high alert Sailor also allegedly fought officers&#x27; attempts to move him before he was charged at Wollongong police station.He was accused of breaching bail conditions, obstructing traffic and resisting arrest, and held in custody ahead of his appearance in court on Saturday.No officers were injured in the incident, police said.The premiership-winning former NRL player appeared in handcuffs wearing a Chicago Bulls T-shirt as the weekend bail court was told he was in the process of a \"difficult\" separation from his wife of almost 30 years.He accepted he had breached existing bail conditions that prevented him from being intoxicated in public, the court was told.Acting magistrate Paul Fernon warned Sailor against obstructing police who were just doing their jobs while arresting him.\"It&#x27;s a job that&#x27;s made harder when people don&#x27;t let them do their work,\" he told the Queensland-born ex-winger.Sailor was on bail for alcohol-related charges stemming from an incident in Sydney&#x27;s city centre more than a year earlier when the latest arrest took place.He previously pleaded not guilty to charges of common assault, behaving in an offensive manner, refusing to leave a licensed premises and intimidation after allegedly attacking two men outside a bar in November 2024.Mr Fernon said he understood Sailor was going through a difficult family situation, but that was no excuse for breaching his undertakings.He released Sailor on conditions that included seeing a doctor within seven days and accepting any recommended treatments, as well as an undertaking that he wouldn&#x27;t be intoxicated in public.\"If you breach your bail conditions, you&#x27;ll end up back in custody. That&#x27;s just what happens,\" the magistrate said.\"The responsibility is on you ... just you.\"Sailor, who sat forward in his cell as he was told he would be allowed to leave, replied: \"Yes sir. Thanks very much, appreciate it.\"He is due to face Wollongong Local Court on December 16 on the latest charges, while a hearing has been scheduled for February over the assault allegations.Sailor was a prolific try-scorer during his 17-year rugby career, including crossing the line 13 times in 37 games for the Wallabies and earning a start in the 2003 Rugby World Cup final.He finished his 222-game NRL career in 2009 after nine seasons with the Brisbane Broncos and two seasons with the St George Illawarra Dragons.",

          "content": "The alleged drug traffickers killed by the US military in a strike on September two were heading to link up with another, larger vessel that was bound for Suriname — a small South American country east of Venezuela – the admiral who oversaw the operation told politicians on Thursday, according to two sources with direct knowledge of his remarks.According to intelligence collected by US forces, the struck boat planned to \"rendezvous\" with the second vessel and transfer drugs to it, Adm. Frank Bradley said during the briefings, but the military was unable to locate the second vessel. Bradley argued there was still a possibility the drug shipment could have ultimately made its way from Suriname to the US, the sources said, telling politicians that justified striking the smaller boat even if it wasn&#x27;t directly heading to US shores at the time it was hit.US drug enforcement officials say that trafficking routes via Suriname are primarily destined for European markets. US-bound drug trafficking routes have been concentrated on the Pacific Ocean in recent years.READ MORE: Pentagon denies &#x27;kill them all&#x27; order The new detail adds yet another wrinkle to the Trump administration&#x27;s argument that striking the boat multiple times, and killing survivors, was necessary in order to protect the US from an imminent threat.Secretary of State Marco Rubio told travelling press in Florida shortly after the strike that the alleged drug boat targeted was \"probably headed to Trinidad or some other country in the Caribbean.\" However, President Donald Trump said in a post announcing the strike on September two that \"The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States.\"Bradley, who led Joint Special Operations Command at the time of the strike, also acknowledged that the boat had turned around before being struck, because the people on board appeared to see the American aircraft in the air, the sources said. CNN reported in September that the boat turned around before being hit.The US military ultimately struck the boat four times—the first time splitting the boat in half and leaving two survivors clinging to a capsized portion, CNN reported on Thursday. The second, third and fourth strikes killed them and sunk the vessel.The survivors were also waving at something in the air, the sources said Bradley told them, although it&#x27;s unclear whether they might have been surrendering or asking the US aircraft they had spotted for help.The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.READ MORE: Unseen images of Jeffrey Epstein&#x27;s private island revealedIt is considered a war crime to kill shipwrecked people, which the Pentagon&#x27;s law of war manual defines as people \"in need of assistance and care\" who \"must refrain from any hostile act.\" Although most Republicans have signalled support for President Donald Trump&#x27;s broader military campaign in the Caribbean, the secondary strike on September two has drawn bipartisan scrutiny — including, most consequentially, a vow from the Senate Armed Services Committee to conduct oversight.Hegseth&#x27;s role in the secondary strike — including the precise orders he gave Bradley — continues to be a point of scrutiny.Politicians were told on Thursday that Hegseth had made clear before the mission began that the strikes should be lethal, CNN has reported, but that he was not made aware of the survivors until after they had been killed, one of the sources with direct knowledge said.Bradley understood the mission objective to be to kill all 11 individuals on board and sink the boat, a US official said. But the order was not specifically an order to kill all and provide no quarter, meaning that someone who surrenders will be killed, which has \"specific implications\" and is illegal, the US official said.READ MORE: Trump hurls outrageous slur at female reporterDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Beyond its namesake television and motion picture division, Warner owns HBO Max and DC Studios. And Netflix has risen to dominance as a household name ubiquitous to on-demand content, while building its own production arm to release popular titles like Stranger Things and Squid Game.The cash and stock deal is valued at $US27.75 per Warner share, giving it a total enterprise value of approximately $US82.7 billion ($124.55 billion). The transaction is expected to close after Warner separates its Discovery Global cable operations into a new publicly-traded company in the third quarter of 2026.READ MORE: Son of high-profile man found guilty of raping woman inside home Shares of Warner Bros rose nearly 3 per cent in premarket trading while shares of Netflix and Paramount fell more than 2 per cent.Gaining Warner&#x27;s legacy studios would mark a notable shift for Netflix&#x27;s current movie theatre footprint. Under the proposed acquisition Netflix has promised to continue theatrical releases for Warner&#x27;s studio films — honouring Warner&#x27;s contractual agreements for movie releases.Netflix has kept most of its original content within its core online platform. But there have been a few exceptions, such as limited theatre screenings of a KPop Demon Hunters sing-a-long and its coming Stranger Things series finale.As recently as October — when Warner signalled that it was open to a potential sale of its business — Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos reiterated on an earnings call that the company had been \"very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks\" and that there was \"no change there\".\"We believe that we can be and we will be choosy,\" Sarandos said at the time, without fully ruling out a potential bid for Warner.READ MORE: Tributes to woman killed by her own dog in South Australian home Friday&#x27;s announcement arrives after a monthslong bidding war for Warner Bros Discovery.
