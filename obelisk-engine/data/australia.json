We&#x27;ll see you at home, Don. Love you.\"READ MORE: Men seen fleeing into bush after police bust $10 million cannabis crop Day responded to the video saying: \"those bastards will regret that they ever f***ed with us\".Queensland Police officers had been due to testify at Day&#x27;s now aborted trial about the alleged serious danger the American&#x27;s threats posed due to his association with the Trains.Day had prepared a sniper&#x27;s nest for a confrontation with police and told the Trains to do the same with \"determination and fury\", saying he looked forward to \"taking the scalps of our enemies\".Day encountered the Train family through public comments and videos posted around a \"similar, distrustful view of society\".A Queensland inquest in November 2025 found the Trains were delusional and believed \"war had reached their gates\" in the form of a battle to the death with Satanic entities disguised as police.\"It was the Trains&#x27; shared psychotic disorders, not their communications with Mr Day, that explained their actions,\" Day&#x27;s lawyer, Jon Sands, told the US court.Mr Sands called for his client to be sentenced to two years and three months with 12 months of supervised release.Prosecutor Timothy Courchaine asked for a sentence of three years and 10 months with three years&#x27; supervised release.Day was sentenced to 36 months&#x27; imprisonment minus time already served.He had spent two years and three months in custody since his December 2023 arrest by the FBI in Arizona.Day will be on supervised release for three years after serving at least 90 per cent of his term.He was also ordered to forfeit his firearms and ammunition, including military-style rifles, shotguns and handguns.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
