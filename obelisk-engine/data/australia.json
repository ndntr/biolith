The days ahead are going to be difficult. They are uncertain,\" Albanese said.LIVE UPDATES: US launches &#x27;major combat operations in Iran&#x27;He said he believed it was key for global stability that Iran did not obtain a nuclear weapon. \"We support the [United] States acting to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and to prevent Iran from continuing to threaten international peace security,\" he said.He said Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei \"was responsible for orchestrating attacks on Australian soil\".\"His passing will not be mourned,\" he said.In a statement released yesterday, just hours after the strikes began, Albanese slammed the \"brutal acts of violence and intimidation\" the regime uses, including targeted attacks in Australia.Albanese said he supported the United States \"acting to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and to prevent Iran continuing to threaten international peace and security,\" though did not directly mention the strikes.\"The regime has instigated a brutal crackdown on its own people, leaving thousands of Iranian civilians dead.
