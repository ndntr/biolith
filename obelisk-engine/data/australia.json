He was in shackles and wearing a jail suicide prevention smock.His arraignment was postponed until January 7 at his attorney&#x27;s request. He spoke only to say \"yes, your honour\" to agree to the date.LIVE UPDATES: Alleged Bondi gunman charged with 59 offences including 15 counts of murderAfter the hearing, Nick Reiner&#x27;s attorney Alan Jackson called the case “a devastating tragedy that has befallen the Reiner family.” He said the proceedings will be very complex.“And we ask that during this process you allow the system to move forward in the way that it was designed to move forward,\" Jackson said outside the courthouse.\"Not with a rush to judgment, not with jumping to conclusions.\"Jackson declined to answer shouted questions from dozens of reporters surrounding him.Nick Reiner was charged Tuesday with killing the 78-year-old actor and director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner.READ MORE: Youngest victim of mass shooting to be farewelled today“Their loss is beyond tragic and we will commit ourselves to bringing their murderer to justice,\" Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said at a Tuesday news conference with LA Police Chief Jim McDonnell.The two counts of first-degree murder come with special circumstances of multiple murders and an allegation that the defendant used a dangerous weapon, a knife. The additions could mean a greater sentence.Hochman said his office has not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty in the case. Reiner is being held without bail.“This case is heartbreaking and deeply personal, not only for the Reiner family and their loved ones but for our entire city,” McDonnell said.READ MORE: What we know about Nick Reiner, son of Rob and Michele ReinerThe charges came two days after the couple was found dead from apparent stab wounds in their home in the upscale Brentwood neighbourhood on the west side of Los Angeles.Nick Reiner did not resist when he was arrested hours later in the Exposition Park area near the University of Southern California, about 14 miles (22.5 kilometres) from the crime scene, police said.Rob Reiner was the Emmy-winning star of the sitcom “All in the Family” who went on to direct films including “When Harry Met Sally...” and “The Princess Bride.” He was an outspoken liberal activist for decades. Michele Singer Reiner was a photographer, movie producer and advocate for LGBTQ+ rights. They had been married for 36 years.Several of those closest to them, including actors Billy Crystal, Albert Brooks, Martin Short and Larry David, released a statement mourning and celebrating the couple on Tuesday night.READ MORE: &#x27;Torn away&#x27;: Emotional scenes as mourners farewell first victims of Bondi terror attack“They were a special force together — dynamic, unselfish and inspiring,” the statement said.“We were their friends, and we will miss them forever.”Nick Reiner had been scheduled to make an initial court appearance on Tuesday, but his attorney said he was not brought from the jail to the courthouse for medical reasons and the appearance was postponed to Wednesday.Jackson is a high-profile defense attorney and former LA County prosecutor who represented Harvey Weinstein at his Los Angeles trial and Karen Read at her intensely followed trials in Massachusetts. He was a central figure in the HBO documentary on the Read case.On the other side will be Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian, whose recent cases included the Menendez brothers&#x27; attempt at resentencing and the trial of Robert Durst.Authorities haven’t said anything about a motive for the killings and would give few details when asked at the news conference.Readers seeking support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or beyond blue on 1300 22 4636.Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467.Sign up here to receive our daily newsletters and breaking news alerts, sent straight to your inbox.",
