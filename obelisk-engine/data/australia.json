It will be alleged that the money came from fraudulent claims submitted to the NDIS, including on occasions where supports and services were not provided to participants. AFP and National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) fraud investigators executed a search warrant at a home in Villawood in December last year.Police seized $35,000 in cash, alleged to be the proceeds of crime, as well as air guns and gel blasters.The 31-year-old is expected to face Downing Centre Local Court today after being charged with one count of dealing money reasonably suspected of being proceeds of an indictable crime of $1 million or more.READ MORE: Surfer&#x27;s chilling warning before Manly attackIf convicted, the suspect faces up to four years in prison.
