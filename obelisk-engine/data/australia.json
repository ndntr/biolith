Detective Senior Constable Jesse Coppel said the group accused the victim of taking photos of people at the pier.\"During the course of the confrontation he&#x27;s shown his phone to the offenders, proven that he&#x27;s not done it and they&#x27;ve proceeded to assault him anyway,\" Coppel said.\"The information we have indicates that people have seen the contents of his phone prior to it being destroyed and there was nothing of that material or that nature on the phone .\"It seems to me as if they have used this as an excuse to confront this man and when it&#x27;s not followed through they&#x27;ve assaulted him anyway regardless.\"Coppel described the behaviour was \"disgusting\" and people deserved to be able to enjoy the beach peacefully. \"People behaving in this way is deplorable, it doesn&#x27;t belong here,\" he said.The man was taken to hospital with a broken arm and has since returned home despite previously intending to spend Christmas in Australia.Coppel said police had not been able to speak with him at length.

A car has been seized from a Dee Why apartment with extensive damage to the front of the vehicle. Parkes was treated at the scene before being taken to Royal Shore Hospital in a critical condition. He later died in hospital.

To be loved by our dad was something truly special. We always knew we were loved, and we always knew he was proud of us. He was a constant source of strength, guidance and unconditional support, and we were so incredibly proud to call him our dad.\"He was a beloved father of four, a foster carer, a grandfather to seven, a son, and brother. He was an ultimate family man who adored his children and his grandchildren. Everyone loved our dad because he was generous, genuine, kind and deeply caring.\"He was a man of duty, loyalty and responsibility. He showed his care through action — he would give anything to anyone. He could build or fix anything, and he carried himself with an old-school integrity that feels rare today. Yet he was also a massive softy: open-minded, accepting, happy to be proven wrong, and someone who took people exactly as they came.READ MORE: Police search for group after tourist assaulted, robbed at Melbourne pier \"Dad was also an accomplished and experienced triathlete, recently competing for Australia at the World Championships. He was a safe and responsible rider, simply out enjoying some exercise on a Sunday morning, minding his own business. He did not deserve to die in such a horrific way.\"Dad also had a lifelong love of rugby league. In his younger years, he played reserve grade for the Balmain Tigers, and that love of the game — and of the Wests Tigers — was proudly passed down to his children.\"We are working closely with police and will do everything in our power to ensure justice for our dad. We also appeal to anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who has information — no matter how small it may seem — to please come forward and contact police. That information could be critical.\"While justice matters deeply to us, we do not want our dad&#x27;s story to be defined solely by the way his life was taken, but by the extraordinary man he was and the values he lived by.\"We would like to sincerely thank the incredible staff at Royal North Shore Hospital, who treated our dad with the utmost care, compassion and dignity. Their kindness and professionalism during the most difficult days of our lives will never be forgotten. Dad received a large guard of honour, and knowing him, he would have absolutely loved that — and been deeply humbled by it.READ MORE: NSW Premier doubles down on the &#x27;toughest gun restrictions&#x27; in the country, says more changes are imminent \"Dad fought right to the very end. In true Parkesy fashion, his final act was one of extraordinary generosity. He gave everything he could so that others could live. He donated his liver, his kidneys, and his heart of gold. He would give anything to anyone — and in the end, he even gave someone his heart.\"Because of him, multiple people have been given the chance at life. Somewhere out there, our dad will live on — in the heartbeat of a stranger. He has always been our hero, and now he is someone else&#x27;s hero too.\"Taken far too soon in a tragic accident, our dad has left a hole that can never be filled. He was selfless in every part of his life, always putting others before himself — and even in his passing, that generosity continued.\"We want our dad to be remembered for the love he gave, the lives he touched, and the man he was — selfless to the very end.\"Forever loved.\"Forever missed.\"Forever our hero.\"May you rest in eternal peace, Dad.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
