Vietjet Aviation said it was cancelling or delaying flights but did not provide details.China&#x27;s Sanya, renowned for seafront resorts and sandy beaches, closed tourist attractions, shuttered businesses and suspended public transport.&#x27;Worst-case scenarios&#x27;China&#x27;s weather agency forecast heavy rainfall and strong winds in Hainan and nearby Guangdong province and Guangxi region, with areas in Hainan set to receive as much as 320 mm (12.6 inches) of rain from Sunday to Monday.Sanya issued a red typhoon alert on Sunday morning - the highest in China&#x27;s colour-coded warning system - and raised its emergency response to the most severe level, according to posts on the local government&#x27;s WeChat account.READ MORE: Beaches in Spanish tourist hotspot shut after rare, venomous sea slugs found City officials convened a meeting on Saturday evening, urging preparations for \"worst-case scenarios\", the government said.All classes and construction were suspended, and shopping centres, restaurants and supermarkets were closed from Sunday. Vessels have been ordered to stop operating in Sanya&#x27;s waters.Since July, record rainfall has lashed China&#x27;s north and south in what meteorologists have described as extreme weather linked to climate change.Natural disasters including flooding and drought caused 52.15 billion yuan (US$7.28 billion) in direct economic losses in China last month, affecting millions of people and leaving 295 dead or missing, data from the Ministry of Emergency Management showed.The Vietnamese government likened the strength of Kajiki to that of Yagi, which battered the country less than a year ago, killing about 300 people and causing US$3.3 billion of property damage.- Reuters",
