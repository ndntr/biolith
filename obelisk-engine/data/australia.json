The train was about halfway through its journey and had just departed from a stop at Peterborough when police began receiving calls about people being stabbed onboard.Passengers described scenes of panic as bloodied travelers raced down the train to get away from the knifeman. The most seriously wounded victim is a member of railway staff who tried to stop the attacker. Police called his actions \" nothing short of heroic\".READ MORE: &#x27;Incredible&#x27; mystery sky boom rattles homes, people in regional VictoriaHe is hospitalised in a critical but stable condition.Williams was arrested when the train made an emergency stop in the town of Huntingdon in eastern England.
