A 16-year-old boy was charged with drug offences.READ MORE: Cool Christmas forecast across the south-east but a scorcher in the westHe has been bailed to appear before a childrens&#x27; court at a later date.Two 16-year-old boys and a 19-year-old man were interviewed by police and are expected to be charged via summons.The investigation into the incident remains ongoing.This week&#x27;s spate of beach brawls follows the release of damning crime figures which found child offenders accounted for more than half of all robberies, carjackings, home invasions and aggravated burglaries across the state in the 12 months to September.A group of almost 1200 children were arrested nearly 7100 times across the year.\"That particular group drives some of the crime types that cause significant harm in the community,\" Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Robert Hill said.Hill yesterday vowed to identify every teenager involved in Wednesday&#x27;s beach riot.He urged parents to turn their children in if they attended the beach party.\"It&#x27;s better that you proactively contact police rather than waiting for us to knock on your door in about two or three weeks&#x27; time, if not earlier,\" Hill said.READ MORE: NASCAR driver, family dead in US plane crashWednesday&#x27;s Mordialloc brawl saw the riot squad, water police and the police AirWing deployed to the gathering.\"I&#x27;ve called them a brat pack, you know, young people terrifying those within a shopping precinct and also conducting themselves on the beach, on the foreshore area, attacking our police members,\" Hill said.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
