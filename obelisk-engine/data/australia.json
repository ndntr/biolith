Police have told 9News that they were unaware the baby was in the vehicle, and if they did, they would have approached the incident differently. Parker is facing an array of charges, including learner driver exceeding speeds of 45km/h, driving with two passengers without fastened seatbelts, driving recklessly, and not complying with directions to stop the vehicle.The four passengers were released without charge.READ MORE: Aged care workers receive another pay boostParker faced court today by video-link, yawning and handcuffed from Newcastle police station.Police prosecutors opposed a bid for bail, stating there was a risk Parker could pose further damage to the community. It was her second court appearance this week after being sentenced to an 18-month community corrections order for shoplifting on Monday.The court was also told that she is 11 weeks pregnant and that her criminal record contains multiple driving offences. Parker was denied bail despite her lawyer, Adam Ryan, arguing that she was vulnerable in custody due to her young age and background. \"The police did see her getting out of the driver&#x27;s door, however, nothing in the facts says she was actually seen driving the vehicle,\" said Ryan.She is set to face court again on October 8.

First Ministers noted that these increases are largely driven by factors outside the states&#x27; control …\"States and territories cannot address these issues alone. \"While first ministers recognised the Commonwealth&#x27;s efforts to improve access to care and reduce pressure on hospitals, these efforts will not shift the dial quickly enough.\"The government said it was ready to negotiate in good faith and wanted a final deal signed off by the end of the year.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
