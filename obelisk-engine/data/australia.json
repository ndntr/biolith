          "content": "The Coalition has split for the second time in less than a year as Opposition Leader Sussan Ley refuses to comment and Nationals Leader David Littleproud rules the agreement with the Liberal Party as \"untenable\".The entire Nationals frontbench, including leader David Littleproud, quit in protest after three senators were dumped from the shadow ministry for breaking Coalition by voting against the government&#x27;s hate speech laws, despite the shadow cabinet agreeing to back the legislation. This morning, Littleproud confirmed he has broken from the Coalition after Ley refused to reinstate the three senators.READ MORE: Australia marks national day of mourning over Bondi attack\"The National Party is our own sovereign party. Sussan Ley cannot force us to vote one way or another. And when we have not breached any process, any procedure in the Coalition,\" he said. \"This is not what the National Party want but I cannot stand by and have three courageous senators, who put their jobs on the line for no reason that has any veracity whatsoever, to be disrespected.\"If these three senators could not be accepted, then our Coalition has become untenable.\"Littleproud said it was time for the Nationals to \"move on\" and for the Liberals to \"work out who they are\", but would not close the door on a remerger.\"I believe in a Coalition, but not at any cost, not without respect, not without understanding, not being forced to vote away without having consequences hung over you,\" he said. \"That&#x27;s not how you operate.\" It is the second time the Coalition has split in the space of a year, after the Nationals and Liberals briefly separated following their historic loss in last year&#x27;s federal election.Littleproud criticised Ley, saying she mishandled the government&#x27;s hate speech and gun reform laws, while providing a glowing review of the \"great Coalition\" under previous opposition leader Peter Dutton.\"There is no shadow minister that can serve in Sussan Ley&#x27;s shadow ministry. That was made clear to us in the shadow cabinet,\" he said. Ley said the focus of today, which is the National Day of Mourning for the victims of the December 14 terrorist attack at Bondi, should remain on those affected. \"This is a National Day of Mourning, and my responsibility as Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Liberal Party is to Australians in mourning,\" she said in a statement released during Littleproud&#x27;s press conference. 9news.com.au understands Ley urged Littleproud earlier today to pause all media for 24 hours to allow for the day of mourning and regrets his decision not to heed her advice. Ley is expected to front the media tomorrow. READ MORE: Trump announces &#x27;framework of future deal&#x27; for Greenland reachedCoalition split follows mass resignationsYesterday, Ley accepted the resignations of frontbenchers Bridget McKenzie, Ross Cadell and Susan McDonald after they broke ranks to vote against the hate speech bill in the Senate.While Coalition backbenchers are free to cross the floor under the agreement between the Liberals and Nationals, frontbenchers are required to vote in line with the position taken by the shadow cabinet.Littleproud then wrote to Ley, threatening the entire Nationals frontbench would follow in order \"to take collective responsibility\" if she accepted the trio&#x27;s resignations.Ley called the resignations \"unnecessary\" and said she would not make any permanent changes to the shadow ministry to give her junior partner time to reconsider.\"The Liberal Party supports the Coalition arrangements because they deliver the most effective political alliance for good government,\" she said in a statement yesterday.READ MORE: Trump&#x27;s latest move triggered a stock bloodbath. But it&#x27;s good news for AussiesMcKenzie defended her opposition to the hate speech laws earlier this morning, insisting the reforms needed further investigation through a short Senate inquiry.\"This was a very difficult decision for our room,\" she told Today. \"To say that somehow we should have folded on this legislation and against our principles, I think, is sending the wrong message.\"Social Services Minister Tanya Plibersek criticised the Coalition for making this week \"all about themselves\" instead of being united and bringing Australia together after the Bondi attack.\"It&#x27;s very disappointing that the Coalition made this week all about themselves and their own chaos and division,\" she told Today.\"After calling for parliament to be returned, after calling for stronger laws, they haven&#x27;t backed those stronger laws, they&#x27;ve actually asked them to be watered down\"They&#x27;re not even a Coalition anymore, they&#x27;re falling apart at the seams at a time when we need stability and unity and adult behaviour in this country.\"",

          "content": "US President Donald Trump has claimed the \"framework of a future deal\" on Greenland has been reached, and dropped his latest tariff threat over his mooted takeover of the island.\"This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations,\" he wrote on Truth Social.He also announced that due to this understanding, he would not impose the threatened tariffs previously announced for European allies from February 1.READ MORE: Trump makes major Greenland U-turn, but continues threats over island \"Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region,\" he said in his post. \"Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st.\"This would have taken the form of 10 per cent import tariffs on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland.While details of the \"framework\" were scant, Trump said other talks were being had regarding his planned \"Golden Dome\" missile defence system as it pertained to Greenland. READ MORE: Australia marks national day of mourning over Bondi attack He also said the deal would cover the future of \"the entire Arctic Region\". \"Further information will be made available as discussions progress,\" Trump wrote.\"Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and various others, as needed, will be responsible for the negotiations – They will report directly to me. \"Trade war off the table? Last weekend, Trump announced 10 per cent tariffs would apply on goods imported to the US from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland, on the basis of their opposition to US control of Greenland.In return, European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen said Europe&#x27;s response would be \"unflinching, united and proportional\".And French President Emmanuel Macron had proposed the possibility of Europe&#x27;s anti-coercion law, colloquially known as the \"trade bazooka\".If activated – which it never has been – it would allow Europe to sanction individuals or institutions perceived to be putting undue pressure on the EU.But the prospect of a US-EU trade war appears off the table for the moment.Trump&#x27;s online announcement came just hours after Trump&#x27;s speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in which the US president said he would not use the military to effect a Greenland takeover, after leaving that option open for the first year of his second term.READ MORE: Third person charged over death of teen in Mount Druitt, Sydney \"That&#x27;s probably the biggest statement I made, because people thought I would use force,\" Trump said overnight.\"I don&#x27;t have to use force. I don&#x27;t want to use force. I won&#x27;t use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.\"The acquisition of Greenland for the US had been an on-and-off headline-grabbing priority during Trump&#x27;s second presidency, but rhetoric ramped up dramatically in recent weeks after the brazenly successful US kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro to stand trial in the US earlier this month.READ MORE: Teen arrested after alleged antisemitic attack on boys in Melbourne Trump has claimed that US possession of Greenland is necessary for national and global security, and that Denmark is unable to effectively defend the semi-autonomous island.The US currently operates one military base on Greenland, but under a decades-old agreement with Denmark, has broad latitude to operate military in the territory.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen have repeatedly pushed back against Trump&#x27;s threats, saying the future of Greenland does not lie with the US.READ MORE: Has Trump really ended eight wars? Fact-checking the president&#x27;s claim Other European nations also recently took a stronger stance against the idea, led by French President Emmanuel Macron - which pro mpted Trump to threaten the aforementioned tariffs last weekend.The Danish and Greenland leaders do not yet appear to have responded to Trump&#x27;s latest announcement.His Truth Social post did not mention them.",

          "content": "Prince Harry has struck a defensive tone at the start of his testimony against the publisher of the Daily Mail tabloid newspaper and left the witness box hours later on the brink of tears.After disputing that reporters used legitimate sources to publish revealing details of his life, he provided an emotional glimpse into the toll that a life in the spotlight and his battle against the British media had taken on him and his family.\"They continue to come after me, they have made my wife&#x27;s life an absolute misery,\" he said as he choked back tears in London&#x27;s High Court on Wednesday (Thursday AEDT).READ MORE: Coalition in freefall as Nationals quite shadow cabinet en masseHarry and six other prominent figures, including Elton John and actor Elizabeth Hurley, allege that Associated Newspapers Ltd invaded their privacy by engaging in a \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\" for 20 years, attorney David Sherborne said.The publisher has denied the allegations, called them preposterous and said the roughly 50 articles in question were reported with legitimate sources that included close associates willing to inform on their famous friends. It is expected to name sources during the nine-week trial.Harry says he was &#x27;paranoid beyond belief&#x27;Harry said in his 23-page witness statement that he was distressed and disturbed by the intrusion into his early life by the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday into his early life and it made him \"paranoid beyond belief\".It was Harry&#x27;s second time testifying after he bucked House of Windsor tradition and became the first senior royal to testify in a court in well over a century when he took the stand in his similar lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mirror in 2023.Harry, dressed in a dark suit, held a small Bible in his right hand in London&#x27;s High Court and swore to \"almighty God that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth\".Under the English court practice, Harry presented written testimony of his claims and after asserting it was true under oath, he was immediately put under cross-examination.After the Duke of Sussex said he preferred to be called Prince Harry, he acknowledged that his 23-page statement was authentic and accurate.Defence lawyer Antony White, in a calm and gentle tone, began to put questions to Harry to determine if the sourcing of the articles, in fact, had come from royal correspondents working their sources at official events or from friends or associates of the prince.Harry denied suggestions he was friendly with journalists who covered the royal family or that his friends gave details about him to the tabloids.\"My social circles were not leaky,\" he declared.Increasingly defensiveHis curt replies during cross-examination and efforts to explain what it&#x27;s like living under what he called \"24-hour surveillance\" eventually brought the intervention of the judge, who told him not to argue with the defence lawyer.\"You don&#x27;t have to bear the burden of arguing the case today,\" Justice Matthew Nicklin told the frustrated prince.As a soft-spoken Harry became increasingly defensive, White said: \"I am intent on you not having a bad experience with me, but it is my job to ask you these questions.\"Harry suggested that details in articles had come from eavesdropping on his phone calls or having private investigators snoop on him. He said journalist Katie Nicholl had the luxury to use the term \"unidentified source\" deceptively to hide unlawful measures of investigation.\"If you complain, they double down on you in my experience,\" he said in explaining why he had not objected to the articles at the time.For decades, Harry has had what he called an \"uneasy\" relationship with the media, but kept mum and followed the family protocol of \"never complain, never explain,\" he said.&#x27;Vicious persistent attacks&#x27;The litigation is part of Harry&#x27;s self-proclaimed mission to reform the media that he blames for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris.He also said persistent press attacks on his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, led them to leave royal life and move to the United States in 2020.He said \"vicious persistent attacks\", harassment and racist articles about Meghan, who is biracial, had inspired him to break from family tradition to finally sue the press.After cross-examination, Harry&#x27;s lawyer asked him how he felt about the way Associated Newspapers was defending the case.Despite having brought the lawsuit and pushed for a trial for accountability, Harry said it was \"fundamentally wrong to put all of us through this again\" when all he wanted was an apology.\"I have never believed that my life is open season to be commercialised by these people,\" he said.After mentioning his wife, who is not a party in the case, Harry choked up and appeared to be holding back tears as he stepped out of the witness box and walked slowly out of the courtroom.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Experts say bull sharks are likely to have been drawn to shallower, beachside waters after recent heavy rain in NSW, which has also churned up the waters to help conceal them.Professor Jodie Rummer from James Cook University said bull sharks are one of the few shark species that can tolerate the brackish post-storm water, when saltwater and freshwater mingled more than normal.Other experts say they are drawn to stirred-up areas to feed, as the rain flushes animals downriver.People are urged to steer clear of murky waters after heavy rain.
