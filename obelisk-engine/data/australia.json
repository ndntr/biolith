The exclusion zone encompasses an area from the Gold Coast Highway, North Street, Loders Creek and to the Broadwater.It includes 36 campsites, leaving 91 people locked out. They have been offered alternative accommodation. The Broadwater Tourist Park said online that the storm \"resembled worse than anything we saw during Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred\".Broncos legend Corey Parker and his radio personality wife, Margaux, were camping at the park with their family and lost some of their items.\"We&#x27;ve lost caravan awnings and gazebos, our car&#x27;s been damaged, our caravan&#x27;s been damaged, but you know we&#x27;re all well and safe,\" Margaux said.When the storm hit, mother and daughter, Elissa and Shayla, were hiding behind their car as a neighbour&#x27;s boat came flying towards them.\"We hunkered down behind the wheel, my thinking was if the boat did come at us, we were safe behind the car,\" Elissa told 9News.Shayla added: \"There were poles flying everywhere, hitting us a bit, it was terrifying, so we just were like it&#x27;s safer to get out of this kind of area.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

They didn&#x27;t take a backward step\".Police have increased their security at Cronulla Beach today, after a social media post emerged in the wake of the attack calling for a \"bashing day\" 20 years on from the site of the race-fuelled riots.Police, with help from the riot squad, mounted unit and water police, patrolled the beach.READ MORE: Collapsing crane leaves 91 holidaymakers locked out of caravan park for almost a week But it was peaceful, and no \"bashing\" occurred.Sutherland Shire Mayor Jack Boyd said police have been monitoring threats closely since the attack at Bondi. \"They&#x27;re collaborating to ensure that we can respond if anything did happen. But if you look around, everybody&#x27;s just enjoying a day at the beach,\" he said.The man accused of creating that social media post, 20-year-old Ryder Roy Shaw, was charged and has been denied bail at Gosford Court this week.He will remain behind bars until his next hearing.Police alleged his post publicly threatened violence on the grounds of race or religion.
