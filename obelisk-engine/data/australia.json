This visit almost entirely avoids the capital by holding royal ceremonies at Windsor, a historic town about 32 kilometres to the west, and at Chequers, the prime minister&#x27;s country estate where Trump will meet with Starmer on Thursday.READ MORE: South Australian MP admits to using AI for questionsTrump and first lady Melania took a helicopter to Windsor Castle, where they were greeted warmly by the king and enjoyed a horse-drawn carriage ride through the royal estate&#x27;s massive grounds as military bands played the national anthems of the US and UK.Dozens of protesters took to the streets of Windsor chanting \"Hey, hey, ho, ho, Donald Trump has got to go\" and \"Donald Trump&#x27;s not welcome here.\"\"I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right that we&#x27;re having Trump come for the second state visit due to his horrible rhetoric, policies and actions toward women and people of color,\" Grace Nathew said.On a street lined with British and American flags, the group held signs that said, \"Trump your politics stink\" and \"Go away. You are polluting Windsor.\"Police said they arrested four people Tuesday over a stunt that saw an image of Trump and Jeffrey Epstein projected on a tower at Windsor Castle, a reminder of the president&#x27;s relationship with the disgraced financier.London&#x27;s police force deployed 1600 officers as they expected members of about 50 different groups to protest.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
