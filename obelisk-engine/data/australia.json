There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Matt Utai and police say he is not involved in any criminal activity.LIVE UPDATES: Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor arrestedPolice said the alleged gunman fired from an SUV before it drove away. A short time later the car, a black Toyota, was found burnt out in the nearby suburb of Wiley Park.The following night, at about 12.45am, shots were fired at a house in St Clair. A woman in her 50s was uninjured inside.A second burnt-out car discovered a short time later in Colyton was seized by police for forensic examination.The morning following the second shooting, at 6.05am, a fire broke out at a Guildford West house and a nearby car was set alight. Firefighters extinguished both blazes and no one was injured.NSW Police set up Strike Force Halesowen to investigate the incidents, all of which are believed to have been targeting the family of Utai.READ MORE: What happens next after Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor arrestedOfficers yesterday raided four properties in Riverwood, Guildford, Lilyfield, Villawood and Auburn and seized three vehicles, 1kg of cocaine, knuckle dusters, electronics and clothing.Two 19-year-old men, a man aged 18 and a 16-year-old boy were all arrested and charged with drug, firearms and other offences.The 18-year-old was granted bail and is due to front court next Tuesday.The two 19-year-olds were refused bail and are scheduled to appear in court today.The 16-year-old was refused bail and is set to appear in the childrens court today.Investigations continue.
