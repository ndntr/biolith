Investigators said Ukraine may be behind the attack.Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov, head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces&#x27; General Staff, died from his injuries, said Svetlana Petrenko, the spokesperson for Russia&#x27;s Investigative Committee, the nation&#x27;s top criminal investigation agency.\"Investigators are pursuing numerous lines of inquiry regarding the murder. One of these is that the crime was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence services,\" Petrenko said.READ MORE: Notorious NSW prisoners caught in brawl at Goulburn SupermaxSince Moscow sent troops into Ukraine nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Ukraine for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them. It has not yet commented on Monday&#x27;s death.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that President Vladimir Putin had been immediately informed about Sarvarov&#x27;s killing.The Defence Ministry said that Sarvarov had previously fought in Chechnya and taken part in Moscow&#x27;s military campaign in Syria.Just over a year ago, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military&#x27;s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov&#x27;s assistant also died. Ukraine&#x27;s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.An Uzbek man was quickly arrested and charged with killing Kirillov on behalf of the Ukrainian security service.READ MORE: What the big four banks think will happen with interest rates next year Putin described Kirillov&#x27;s killing as a \"major blunder\" by Russia&#x27;s security agencies, noting they should learn from it and improve their efficiency.In April, another senior Russian military officer, Lieutenant General Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department in the General Staff, was killed by an explosive device placed in his car parked near his apartment building just outside Moscow. A suspected perpetrator was quickly arrested.Days after Moskalik&#x27;s killing, Ukraine&#x27;s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he received a report from the head of Ukraine&#x27;s foreign intelligence agency on the \"liquidation\" of top Russian military figures, adding that \"justice inevitably comes\" although he didn&#x27;t mention Moskalik&#x27;s name.",

No further detail about the tennis ball bomb was provided.Police also claimed a box-like bomb was found in the boot of the car while two hand-painted Islamic State flags were also found in the car.Further weaponry and explosive devices were discovered by police in the Campsie rental, including a 3D-printed shotgun speed loader, a firearm scope, two more guns and another suspected bomb.Police allege the men left behind videos that indicated their adherence to religiously motivated violent extremism.Footage recorded in late October - six to eight weeks before the attack - and shown in the fact sheet showed each Akram training with long-arm guns and \"moving in a tactical manner\" in a countryside location.Police suspect the area was in NSW.\"The (younger Akram) is recorded appearing to recite, in Arabic, a passage from the Quran,\" the facts sheet states.\"Following the recitation, both the accused and S.AKRAM speak in English and make a number of statements regarding their motivation for the &#x27;Bondi attack&#x27; and condemning the acts of &#x27;Zionists&#x27;.(sic)\"Further footage captured by security cameras at Bondi Beach appears to show the Akrams scoped out the area about 48 hours before their attack.\"There is evidence that the accused and his father ... meticulously planned this terrorist attack for many months,\" the facts sheet says.READ MORE: NSW gun laws to be &#x27;toughest in country&#x27; As well as releasing the police allegations, Deputy Chief Magistrate Michael Antrum today suppressed the identities of 25 survivors, to protect their privacy and assist their recovery.The court order allows victim-survivors to choose if and when they go public with their story, and join other survivors such as Arsen Ostrovsky and hero tobacconist Ahmed Al Ahmed.Akram remains in custody and was today transferred from hospital to a NSW prison under police guard.His case is next due in court in April.",
