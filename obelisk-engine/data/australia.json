But the Federal Court found in 2024 the allegations he raped Higgins were proven on the balance of probabilities, which is a lower civil standard of proof than its criminal counterpart.READ MORE: Notorious mushroom killer Erin Patterson could walk free in her 80s Lehrmann&#x27;s appeal against his defamation loss to Network Ten and journalist Lisa Wilkinson was heard by a panel of judges in August.
