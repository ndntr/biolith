Just before 5am, emergency services were called to a home in Illabo Street in Quakers Hill after reports of a disturbance.

The man was taken to Liverpool Hospital in a critical condition but he died from his injuries later this morning. He is yet to be identified. The woman, Anasaini Waqavuki, was found dead inside the home, allegedly stabbed to death in the kitchen. Police said Waqavuki was previously in a relationship with the alleged killer, and they are working on the belief the incident is domestic violence-related.

Obviously not a nice thing to see.\" Neighbours recalled hearing screams coming from the home in the early hours of the morning but were shocked by the news. \"They seemed to be happy, she was always laughing, they seemed like a normal, happy family,\" neighbour Wayne Spalding said. The 47-year-old man was arrested after he handed himself in to Blacktown Police Station about 5.30am and was charged with two counts of murder this evening. He&#x27;s been denied bail and will front court tomorrow. Multiple crime scenes have been declared, including at the Illabo Street home and at a service station in Woodcroft, where a knife used in the alleged attack was located. A crime scene has also been declared at a home in Blacktown, where the suspect lives, and at Liverpool Hospital. Police have urged any witnesses or anyone with CCTV or dashcam footage between 4.30am and 5.30am to contact Crime Stoppers.Support is available from the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service at 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732).DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

The vessel ran into trouble on Saturday morning, during its first trip back at sea after the death of an 80-year-old passenger on Lizard Island in October.Australian-flagged vessel, the Coral Adventurer, hit a coral reef and ran aground off the Papua New Guinea coast, stuck around 30 kilometres from the city of Lae.

The PNG Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre also confirmed an officer has boarded the vessel and is assisting with the incident.READ MORE: Further delays expected to remove snapped crane hovering over caravan park Crews were waiting for high tide to help re-float the ship, to assess if there&#x27;s any damage.It&#x27;s been troubled waters for the luxury cruise ship that&#x27;s already navigated a turbulent two months after it made headlines in October.Suzanne Rees, an 80-year-old New South Wales tourist, was found dead on remote Lizard Island several hours after being left behind by the Coral Adventurer.The tragedy ultimately sparked several investigations, including by the AMSA and Workplace Health and Safety Queensland, which remains ongoing. This latest 12-night cruise, which costs $13,280 per person, departed from Cairns on December 18, reaching Papua New Guinea last Saturday on December 20. It&#x27;s then been cruising up the coastline over the past week before this latest bungle happened on December 27. Passengers were due to disembark on December 30. Coral Expeditions responded on Saturday evening, saying an initial inspection has found no damage to the vessel and further investigations will be undertaken.

          "content": "Brigitte Bardot, the French 1960s sex symbol who became one of the greatest screen sirens of the 20th century and later a militant animal rights activist, has died. She was 91.Bruno Jacquelin, of the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals, told The Associated Press that she died at her home in southern France, and would not provide a cause of death.He said no arrangements have yet been made for funeral or memorial services. She had been hospitalised last month.READ MORE: Russia hits Kyiv in deadly strike a day before key Trump-Zelenksyy meeting Bardot became an international celebrity as a sexualized teen bride in the 1956 movie And God Created Woman. Directed by her then-husband, Roger Vadim, it triggered a scandal with scenes of the long-legged beauty dancing on tables naked.At the height of a cinema career that spanned some 28 films and three marriages, Bardot came to symbolise a nation bursting out of bourgeois respectability. Her tousled, blond hair, voluptuous figure and pouty irreverence made her one of France&#x27;s best-known stars.Such was her widespread appeal that in 1969 her features were chosen to be the model for \"Marianne\", a bare-breasted statue representing the French Republic, and the official Gallic seal. Bardot&#x27;s face appeared on statues, postage stamps and even on coins.Bardot&#x27;s second career as an animal rights activist was equally sensational. She travelled to the Arctic to blow the whistle on the slaughter of baby seals; she condemned the use of animals in laboratory experiments; and she opposed sending monkeys into space.\"Man is an insatiable predator,\" Bardot told The Associated Press on her 73rd birthday, in 2007.\"I don&#x27;t care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\"Her activism earned her compatriots&#x27; respect and, in 1985, she was awarded the Legion of Honour, the nation&#x27;s highest honour.A turn to the far rightLater, however, she fell from public grace as her animal protection diatribes took on a decidedly extremist tone and her far-right political views sounded racist as she frequently decried the influx of immigrants into France, especially Muslims.She was convicted five times in French courts of inciting racial hatred. Notably, she criticised the Muslim practice of slaughtering sheep during annual religious holidays like Eid al-Adha.Bardot&#x27;s 1992 marriage to fourth husband Bernard d&#x27;Ormale, a onetime adviser to former National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, contributed to her political shift. She described the outspoken nationalist as a \"lovely, intelligent man\".In 2012, she caused controversy again when she wrote a letter in support of Marine Le Pen, the current leader of the party — now renamed National Rally — in her failed bid for the French presidency.In 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Bardot said in an interview that most actors protesting sexual harassment in the film industry were \"hypocritical\" and \"ridiculous\" because many played \"the teases\" with producers to land parts.She said she had never had been a victim of sexual harassment and found it \"charming to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a nice little ass\".A privileged, but &#x27;difficult&#x27; upbringingBrigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born September 28, 1934, to a wealthy industrialist. A shy, secretive child, she studied classical ballet and was discovered by a family friend who put her on the cover of Elle magazine at age 14.Bardot once described her childhood as \"difficult\" and said her father was a strict disciplinarian who would sometimes punish her with a horse whip.But it was French movie producer Vadim, whom she married in 1952, who saw her potential and wrote And God Created Woman to showcase her provocative sensuality, an explosive cocktail of childlike innocence and raw sexuality.The film, which portrayed Bardot as a bored newlywed who beds her brother-in-law, had a decisive influence on New Wave directors Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut, and came to embody the hedonism and sexual freedom of the 1960s.The film was a box-office hit, and it made Bardot a superstar. Her girlish pout, tiny waist and generous bust were often more appreciated than her talent.\"It&#x27;s an embarrassment to have acted so badly,\" Bardot said of her early films.\"I suffered a lot in the beginning. I was really treated like someone less than nothing.\"Bardot&#x27;s unabashed, off-screen love affair with co-star Jean-Louis Trintignant further shocked the nation. It eradicated the boundaries between her public and private life and turned her into a hot prize for paparazzi.Bardot never adjusted to the limelight. She blamed the constant press attention for the suicide attempt that followed 10 months after the birth of her only child, Nicolas. Photographers had broke into her house only two weeks before she gave birth to snap a picture of her pregnant.Nicolas&#x27; father was Jacques Charrier, a handsome French actor whom she married in 1959 but who never felt comfortable in his role as Monsieur Bardot. Bardot soon gave up her son to his father, and later said she had been chronically depressed and unready for the duties of being a mother.\"I was looking for roots then,\" she said in an interview. \"I had none to offer.\"In her 1996 autobiography Initiales B.B., she likened her pregnancy to \"a tumour growing inside me,\" and described Charrier as \"temperamental and abusive\".Bardot married her third husband, West German millionaire playboy Gunther Sachs, in 1966, but the relationship again ended in divorce three years later.Among her films were A Parisian (1957); In Case of Misfortune, in which she starred in 1958 with screen legend Jean Gabin; The Truth (1960); Private Life (1962); A Ravishing Idiot (1964); Shalako (1968); Women (1969); The Bear And The Doll (1970); Rum Boulevard (1971); and Don Juan (1973).With the exception of 1963&#x27;s critically acclaimed Contempt, directed by Godard, Bardot&#x27;s films were rarely complicated by plots. Often they were vehicles to display Bardot&#x27;s curves and legs in scanty dresses or frolicking nude in the sun.\"It was never a great passion of mine,\" she said of filmmaking.\"And it can be deadly sometimes. Marilyn [Monroe] perished because of it.\"Bardot retired to her Riviera villa in St. Tropez at the age of 39 in 1973 after The Woman Grabber.Reinventing herself in middle ageShe emerged a decade later with a new persona: An animal rights lobbyist, her face was wrinkled and her voice was deep following years of heavy smoking. She abandoned her jet-set life and sold off movie memorabilia and jewellery to create a foundation devoted exclusively to the prevention of animal cruelty.Her activism knew no borders. She urged South Korea to ban the sale of dog meat and once wrote to US President Bill Clinton asking why the US Navy recaptured two dolphins it had released into the wild.She attacked centuries-old French and Italian sporting traditions including the Palio, a free-for-all horse race, and campaigned on behalf of wolves, rabbits, kittens and turtle doves.By the late 1990s, Bardot was making headlines that would lose her many fans. She was convicted and fined five times between 1997 and 2008 for inciting racial hatred in incidents inspired by her anger at Muslim animal slaughtering rituals.\"It&#x27;s true that sometimes I get carried away, but when I see how slowly things move forward ... and despite all the promises that have been made to me by all different governments put together — my distress takes over,\" Bardot told the AP.In 1997, several towns removed Bardot-inspired statues of Marianne after the actress voiced anti-immigrant sentiment. Also that year, she received death threats after calling for a ban on the sale of horse meat.Bardot once said that she identified with the animals that she was trying to save.\"I can understand hunted animals because of the way I was treated,\" Bardot said.\"What happened to me was inhuman. I was constantly surrounded by the world press.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

READ MORE: What the weather will be like in your city on New Year&#x27;s EveThe system could cause heavy rainfall of up to 260mm, which could cause flash flooding between Cairns and north of Townsville from tonight into tomorrow.And up to 170mm and flash flooding are forecast in parts of the Gulf Country, Northern Goldfields and Upper Flinders, North West and Central West Forecast Districts.Meanwhile, in the northeast tropical coast, winds are picking up speed and damage.Together, the monsoon trough and winds are expected to spur widespread heavy rainfall.In the 24 hours to 9am today, 217mm of rainfall was already recorded in Cardwell Gap, making it the wettest place in Australia. Consequently, there are flood warnings in place for the Nicholson, Leichhardt, Norman, Gilbert and Diamantin catchments and flood watches for much of the state.The Gregory River in northwest Queensland is already at major flood levels.Senior meteorologist Jonathan How warned conditions could continue for a prolonged time and particularly affect outback and remote communities.\"Heavy rainfall will lead to road closures and community isolation, and this could last for quite some period of time, especially for outback and more remote communities as well,\" he said.\"We are expecting impacts to agriculture, particularly to cattle and livestock, with low temperatures and flood waters expected to last for an extended period of time.\"READ MORE: Over a dozen Aussies charged and 92 children rescued over &#x27;horrific&#x27; operation in the PhilippinesHow said rainfall totals will climb over 300mm through the western parts of the state tomorrow and could reach beyond 600mm by Wednesday.\"We are expecting those four-day totals to reach in excess of, even breaching, 700 millimetres,\" he said.\"And rainfall won&#x27;t end there.\"The monsoon trough and low will then continue to move across the eastern parts of Queensland.The Bureau of Meteorology will have a clearer understanding of where the rainfall is expected later next week.

          "content": "Russia launched a large-scale overnight attack on Kyiv after Ukraine&#x27;s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he plans to meet his US counterpart Donald Trump in Florida Sunday, as efforts continue to end the nearly four-year war in Eastern Europe.The aerial attack killed at least one person – a 71-year-old – and injured 32 more, including two children, according to Kyiv police.Kyiv&#x27;s mayor Vitali Klitschko said more than 2600 residential buildings are currently without heating, as well as 187 kindergartens, 138 schools and 22 social institutions in the capital, amid freezing temperatures.READ MORE: At least 15 injured in a knife and chemical attack at a factory in Japan The attack lasted nearly 10 hours in total, making it one of the longest of the year.Speaking on board a plane bound for the United States Saturday, Zelenskyy repeated calls for the bolstering of Ukraine&#x27;s air defences, saying the country needed more missiles amid Russia&#x27;s relentless attacks. \"The support of Europeans is important to us today. We do not have enough additional air defence systems,\" he said.Ahead of meeting Trump, Zelenskyy is stopping in Canada for talks with President Mark Carney.On Friday, Zelenskyy told reporters that the 20-point peace plan hammered out by Ukrainian and US officials is \"90 per cent ready\" and that he planned to discuss with Trump how Ukraine&#x27;s allies could guarantee its security in the future.Trump said in an interview with Politico that he expects the meeting to \"go good,\" but cautioned that Zelenskyy \"doesn&#x27;t have anything until I approve it\". He added that he also expects to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin \"soon, as much as I want\".In total, Russia launched nearly 500 drones and 40 missiles at Ukraine overnight, Zelenskyy said on Saturday morning, adding that while Russian officials are engaging in talks to end fighting, the ongoing violence speaks for itself.The most recent strikes primarily targeted energy and civilian infrastructure in the capital city, Kyiv, Zelenskyy said.\"In some districts of the capital and the region, electricity and heating are currently unavailable,\" he said. \"Firefighting efforts are underway.\"A CNN reporter in the capital heard attack drones flying overhead and a series of explosions early on Saturday, when Air Force warnings were in place.Fires broke out across the city, engulfing a car repair shop and several residential buildings, and forcing elderly residents to evacuate a care home as flames spread, according to Kyiv Emergency Service.Pointing to Russia&#x27;s recent engagement in talks with US representatives to end fighting in the country, Zelenskyy wrote on X in the wake of the attack that \"Russian representatives engage in lengthy talks, but in reality, Kinzhals and &#x27;shaheds&#x27; speak for them.\"He added, \"This is the true attitude of Putin and his inner circle.\"In response to the attacks, Poland scrambled fighter jets and temporarily closed two airports, Reuters reported, citing a post by the Polish Air Navigation Services Agency on X.The shutdowns of Rzeszow and Lublin airports, in the country&#x27;s southeast, were triggered by \"unplanned military activity related to ensuring state security,\" according to a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) posted on the US Federal Aviation Administration&#x27;s website.US officials said they were hopeful that Sunday&#x27;s Zelenskyy-Trump meeting would be productive after a week of intensive efforts between US and Ukrainian negotiators. While officials did not cite a specific goal for the meeting, Zelenskyy told Axios on Friday that he wanted to conclude a framework to end the war.The meeting is not expected to include any European leaders, according to US and European officials. However, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will join a call on Saturday with Zelenskyy, Trump and other European leaders, a commission spokesperson told Reuters.The Ukrainians have been pushing for a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump for months, European officials said. The Europeans expect a positive meeting because they describe the current dynamic between the US and Ukraine as productive. Still, they acknowledge that the outcome of any meeting with Trump is unpredictable.\"There is no low-risk scenario with Trump,\" said one NATO official.In preparation for Sunday&#x27;s meeting, Zelenskyy said on Friday that he had spoken with the leaders of NATO, Canada, Germany, Finland, Denmark and Estonia to coordinate their positions. \"Ukraine has never been and will never be an obstacle to peace, and we will continue working efficiently to ensure all necessary documents are prepared as quickly as possible,\" he said.Zelenskyy&#x27;s announcement comes after he offered to compromise on some of the thorniest issues that have so far stalled the US-mediated peace process with Russia. It is not clear, however, whether Zelenskyy&#x27;s concessions will satisfy the Kremlin.Asked about Zelenskyy&#x27;s potential willingness to consider territorial concessions for a peace deal, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told CNN that \"giving up the rest of Donetsk could contribute significantly.\"The initial 28-point peace plan, which emerged in November following talks between the United States and Russia, was criticised by Ukraine&#x27;s allies as heavily favouring Moscow. Following weeks of talks between Ukrainian and US officials, that draft has been slimmed down to the current 20-point plan, which Zelenskyy has said can serve as a \"foundational document on ending the war.\"Latest on peace negotiationsZelenskyy told reporters that Ukraine had not received an official response from the Kremlin to the latest proposal. He said Kyiv is negotiating exclusively with Washington, which in turn is communicating with Moscow.If Russia does not agree to the peace plan drafted by Ukraine and the United States, Zelenskyy suggested that more should be done to force Moscow&#x27;s hand. \"If Ukraine shows its position, it is constructive – and Russia, for example, does not agree, then the (existing) pressure is not enough,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that he wants to discuss this with Trump.Russia&#x27;s central demands are for Ukraine to abandon its ambition to join NATO – which was a distant prospect before Moscow launched its all-out invasion of the country in February 2022 – and for Kyiv&#x27;s military to withdraw fully from Ukraine&#x27;s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, a vast area known as the Donbas. It was here that the Kremlin started destabilising Ukraine in 2014, helping pro-Russian separatists gain control of most of the area. The Donbas was eventually illegally annexed by Russia in September 2022.Zelenskyy has offered concessions on both issues. During a wide-ranging press conference on Tuesday to discuss the new 20-point peace plan, Zelenskyy said Ukraine was seeking security guarantees from its allies that would \"mirror\" NATO&#x27;s Article 5 – which requires all members to defend any member that has come under attack – but would no longer pursue full membership of the military alliance.Zelenskyy also said Ukraine would be willing to withdraw its troops from parts of the Donetsk region not currently occupied by Russian forces. The Ukrainian leader said any withdrawal of troops would have to be reciprocal, with Moscow giving up as much Ukrainian territory as that ceded by Kyiv and those pockets of the Donbas becoming demilitarised as a result. Earlier this month, Zelenskyy noted that US negotiators wanted these territories to become \"free economic zones\" once all troops were withdrawn.Ukraine&#x27;s constitution requires any changes to the country&#x27;s borders to be approved in a referendum. Zelenskyy reiterated on Friday that \"the fate of Ukraine should be decided by the people of Ukraine\" and said Ukraine&#x27;s allies \"have enough power to force Russia or to negotiate with the Russians\" to ensure that any such plebiscite could be carried out safely.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
