          "content": "Firefighters are working to rescue a worker trapped for hours beneath the rubble of a medieval tower that partially collapsed while under renovation in the heart of Italy&#x27;s capital, critically injuring another worker.Firefighters faced a complex task on Monday (early Tuesday AEDT) as the structure continued to give way as they tried to get near the trapped worker through a first-floor window, forcing their retreat on telescopic aerial ladders in a cloud of smoke. Another approach on two ladders was also aborted, and a drone sent up in their stead.As dusk approached, firefighters lifted on a crane used giant tubes to suck rubble out of the second-floor window.READ MORE: Four words that reveal the risk millions face onlineThree workers were rescued unharmed after the initial midday (10pm AEDT) collapse, said firefighter spokesperson Luca Cari. Italian media reported that another worker, age 64, was hospitalised in a critical condition but there was no immediate update on his condition. No firefighters were injured in the ongoing operation.Rome&#x27;s top law enforcement official, Prefect Lamberto Giannini, said there were \"signs of life\" from the trapped worker, and that firefighters had managed to give him some protective cover during an earlier rescue attempt.Giannini called the situation \"very complex\" and said that other equipment was being brought in.\"It will be a very long operation. We must try to save this person while mitigating the enormous risks to the people who are trying to save him,&#x27;&#x27; Giannini told reporters.READ MORE: Man charged over UK train stabbingsHundreds of tourists had assembled to watch as firefighters used a mobile ladder to bring a stretcher to the upper level of the Torre dei Conti during the first rescue attempt. Suddenly, another part of the structure partially collapsed, sending up a cloud of debris and forcing firefighters to quickly descend on the ladder.Queen Paglinawan was working in a nearby gelato parlour when she heard the two loud noises from the town in quick succession.\"I was working and then I heard something falling, and then I saw the tower collapse in a diagonal way,&#x27;&#x27; Paglinawan, 27, said as yet another collapse occurred in the background.German student Viktoria Braeu passed by the scene just as the partial collapse during the firefighters&#x27; rescue occurred.READ MORE: Trial begins over road rage dispute that led to death\"We were just at the Colosseum … and we were just walking to get some food. … And then we were like, &#x27;It&#x27;s probably not long until it&#x27;s going to go down&#x27;, and then it just started erupting,&#x27;&#x27; said Braeu, 18.The Torre dei Conti was built in the 13th century by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his family. The tower was damaged in a 1349 earthquake and suffered subsequent collapses in the 17th century.Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri and Italian Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli were at the scene, but did not speak to reporters.\"The firefighters risked their lives with the second collapse. We are worried for the worker who remains trapped,&#x27;&#x27; said Federico Mollicone, chairman of the parliamentary culture committee.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "UK police have charged a 32-year-old man with attempted murder over a mass stabbing attack on a train that wounded 11 people, and said he also tried to kill someone at a London transit station earlier the same day.British Transport Police said Anthony Williams is charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one of actual bodily harm and one of possession of a bladed article over the attack on Saturday.He is also charged with attempted murder over a separate incident at Pontoon Dock light rail station in London earlier that day, and police said investigators are \"looking at other possible linked offences\".READ MORE: Claim of $1 million ransom after Sydney man allegedly kidnapped on the streetPolice say they are not treating the stabbings as an act of terror and are not looking for other suspects. A second man initially arrested as a suspect was released without charge on Sunday after it was determined the 35-year-old was not involved.Williams, a British citizen from the city of Peterborough in eastern England, made a brief appearance at Peterborough Magistrates&#x27; Court on Monday.Williams, who was flanked by four security officers as he stood in the dock wearing a grey prison tracksuit and handcuffs, was ordered detained until his next hearing on December 1. He was not asked to enter pleas.The minutes-long stabbing spree spread fear and panic through a train bound from Doncaster in northern England to London on Saturday evening. The train was about halfway through its journey and had just departed from a stop at Peterborough when police began receiving calls about people being stabbed onboard.Passengers described scenes of panic as bloodied travelers raced down the train to get away from the knifeman. The most seriously wounded victim is a member of railway staff who tried to stop the attacker. Police called his actions \"nothing short of heroic\".READ MORE: &#x27;Incredible&#x27; mystery sky boom rattles homes, people in regional VictoriaHe is hospitalised in a critical but stable condition.Williams was arrested when the train made an emergency stop in the town of Huntingdon in eastern England. Police say he was detained within eight minutes of officers receiving the first emergency calls.Authorities said the attack was an isolated incident but stepped up security on the railway, with armed police officers on patrol on Monday at major train stations.The government rejected calls for increased security measures such as airport-style passenger and baggage screening to be introduced at Britain&#x27;s 3500 railway stations, saying that wouldn&#x27;t be \"proportionate or practical\".In the UK, which has strict gun-control laws, almost half of all homicides involve a knife or sharp instrument. Prime Minister Keir Starmer&#x27;s Labour government has pledged to reduce knife crime and has tightened rules for purchasing knives and banned some kinds of blades.It claims to have had some success, with the number of knife killings down by more than 20 per cent in the year to March 2025 from the previous 12 months, according to the Office for National Statistics.",

Patterson is a \"keen crocheter\" and inside her cell she has access to wool, a hair straightener, books, magazines, television and a computer, Mandy told the Supreme Court in August as her legal team fought for her to be handed a non-parole period.
