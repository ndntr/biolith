Catch!\" and another that appeared to reference an Italian anti-fascist song.READ MORE: China&#x27;s newest aircraft carrier sails through Taiwan Strait for the first timeRobinson grew up in Washington, Utah, and earned a scholarship to attend Utah State University after a strong academic record in high school, but dropped out after just one semester, according to public records, social media, and a university statement.Voter registration records show that Robinson is registered to vote unaffiliated with any party, although he is also listed as an \"inactive\" voter, meaning he hasn&#x27;t voted in at least the most recent two general elections.Social media photos show Robinson wearing grey Converse shoes and sunglasses that appear similar to those worn by the shooting suspect in photos released by law enforcement earlier this week.Cox said at the press conference that a family member of Robinson had reached out to a family friend Thursday night, and the family friend told the Washington County Sheriff&#x27;s Office that \"Robinson had confessed to them or implied that he had committed the incident.\"Robinson was taken into custody around 10pm Thursday, after a 33-hour manhunt, FBI Director Kash Patel said Friday.READ MORE: What big shake-up in weather modelling means for summerRobinson&#x27;s hometown is a quiet suburb of St. George, a city in the southwest corner of the state. It&#x27;s about a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Utah Valley University, where Kirk was gunned down on Wednesday afternoon while holding a campus event.Cox said that a family member of Robinson had told investigators that at a recent family dinner, Robinson had mentioned Kirk&#x27;s upcoming Utah Valley event, and \"they talked about why they didn&#x27;t like him and the viewpoints that he had,\" Cox said. \"The family member also stated Kirk was full of hate and spreading hate.\"The bolt-action rifle Robinson used and left in a wooded area near the campus had various phrases engraved on the bullet casings, Cox said, including \"Oh bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao ciao,\" which appeared to reference an Italian anti-fascist song.Other engravings hinted more at connections to online trolling and memes, including one that said, \"If you read this, you are gay LMAO.\"Robinson graduated from Pine View High School in St. George in 2021, a spokesperson for the school confirmed. He received a resident presidential scholarship to attend Utah State University, according to a Facebook video his mother posted of him reading a letter about the award.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
