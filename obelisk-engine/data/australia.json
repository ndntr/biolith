          "content": "An explosive text exchange between Donald Trump and Norway&#x27;s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr has exposed one of the main reasons for the US president&#x27;s quest to acquire Greenland.In an extraordinary text message to Store, first reported by PBS and confirmed by an official in the Norwegian prime minister&#x27;s office, Trump linked his repeated threats to seize control of Greenland to the fact that he has not been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which he has long coveted.\"Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America,\" Trump wrote in the text.READ MORE: Third shark attack in Sydney in two days, 20 beaches closedStore said he received the message in reply to a text he and Finnish President Alexander Stubb sent Trump, in which the Nordic leaders \"conveyed our opposition to his announced tariff increases against Norway, Finland and select other countries\".He said in a statement that he has \"clearly explained, including to president Trump what is well known, the (Nobel Peace) prize is awarded by an independent Nobel Committee and not the Norwegian Government\".Trump&#x27;s missive came after he threatened to impose an additional 10 per cent tariff on goods from several European countries over their opposition to his plan to acquire Greenland, an autonomous part of Denmark, a fellow NATO member, from February 1.READ MORE: South Australian premier hit with second defamation notice in escalating row with writerTrump&#x27;s threats have rattled NATO as the alliance based on collective defense confronts the prospect that one member might use force against another.\"Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a &#x27;right of ownership&#x27; anyway? There are no written documents, it&#x27;s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also,\" Trump said in his message. \"I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland,\" Trump said in his note to Store.Greenland, a vast Arctic island, was incorporated into Denmark in 1953 as part of global decolonisation movements in the wake of World War II. It is self-governing, but its defence, security and monetary policy are still controlled by Denmark.The Norwegian Nobel Committee is an independent body whose five members are appointed by the Norwegian Parliament.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the president&#x27;s approach in Greenland during a brief Q&A with reporters in Davos, Switzerland, which is hosting the World Economic Forum meeting this week.\"I think it&#x27;s a complete canard that the president would be doing this because of the Nobel,\" Bessent said, immediately after saying he did not \"know anything about the president&#x27;s letter to Norway\".READ MORE: Sydney private school headmaster steps down after secret courtroom dealBessent insisted Trump \"is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States,\" adding that \"we are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else\".Trump has openly coveted the peace prize, which the committee awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado last year.Last week, Machado presented her Nobel medal to Trump, who said he planned to keep it, though the committee said the prize can&#x27;t be revoked, transferred or shared with others.The Nobel Committee since, however, clarified that while the physical medal may change hands, the honour itself cannot be transferred.Although the US has been the bedrock of Euro-Atlantic security for decades, and spent far more on defence in that period than any other NATO member, many NATO allies participated in recent US wars. Forty-three Danes died fighting in Afghanistan following the 2001 invasion.At a news conference in London, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stressed that Denmark is a \"close ally\" of the United Kingdom and the US, and \"a proud NATO member that has stood shoulder to shoulder with us, including at real human cost\".Trump&#x27;s message came after Store and Stubb texted the US president about the additional tariffs he had threatened over Greenland.\"We believe we all should work to take this down and de-escalate – so much is happening around us where we need to stand together,\" the Nordic leaders wrote, according to an official in Store&#x27;s office. The Nobel Committee awarded the 2025 peace prize to María Corina Machado, the leader of Venezuela&#x27;s democratic opposition, who last week gifted her medal to Trump when the pair met in Washington. Trump said it was \"a wonderful gesture of mutual respect\".The Nobel Committee since, however, clarified that while the physical medal may change hands, the honour itself cannot be transferred.",

          "content": "Tens of millions of dollars are on the line as Prince Harry returns to court for the third and final chapter in his legal quest to tame the British tabloids.Harry, also known as the Duke of Sussex, is the most prominent litigant in a case full of high-profile plaintiffs who accuse the publisher of the Daily Mail of invading their privacy by using unlawful information-gathering tactics to snoop on them for sensational headlines.Harry, Elton John and actors Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost are among a group of seven who allege that Associated Newspapers Ltd hired private investigators to bug their cars, obtain their private records and eavesdrop on phone calls.READ MORE: Third shark attack in Sydney in two daysThe publisher has denied the allegations and called them preposterous.Attorney David Sherborne opened his case overnight (late on Monday AEDT) by saying there was a culture at Associated Newspapers that spanned decades to unlawfully dig up dirt \"that wrecked the lives of so many\".He said the company&#x27;s vigorous denials, destruction of records and \"masses upon masses of missing documents\" had prevented the claimants from learning what the newspapers had done.\"They swore that they were a clean ship,\" Sherborne said.\"Associated knew that these emphatic denials were not true. … They knew they had skeletons in their closet.\"The trial in London&#x27;s High Court is expected to last nine weeks and will see the return of Harry to the witness box for the second time since he made history in 2023 by becoming the first senior member of the royal family to testify in more than a century.Harry waved cheerfully at reporters and said \"good morning\" as he entered the court building via a side entrance. He took a seat in the back row of the courtroom near Hurley and Frost.READ MORE: Woman found dead and surrounded by dingoes The prince v the publishersThe case was one of many that has emerged from the widespread phone hacking scandal in which some journalists began intercepting voicemail messages around the turn of this century and continued for more than a decade.Harry won a court judgment in 2023 that condemned the publishers of the Daily Mirror for \"widespread and habitual\" phone hacking. Last year, Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s flagship UK tabloid made an unprecedented apology for intruding on his life for years, and agreed to pay substantial damages to settle his privacy invasion lawsuit.Harry&#x27;s self-proclaimed mission to reform the media is more personal and goes far beyond headlines that attempted to document his party boy youth and romance ups and downs.He holds the press responsible for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris. He also blames them for persistent attacks on his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, that led them to leave royal life and move to the United States in 2020.Repairing rift in the royal familyThe trial comes as Harry tries to repair a damaged relationship with his family since he moved to America and burned the bridge behind him by penning a scorching 2023 memoir, Spare, and airing other family grievances in a Netflix series.Frosty relations with his father, King Charles III, appear to be thawing a bit after the two met for tea last fall when Harry was last in town.But a reunion this time looks unlikely.The start of the trial coincides with Charles&#x27; trip to Scotland and Harry&#x27;s visit is expected to be limited to the opening of the trial and his early testimony.Wins and losses before trialThe case against the Mail was filed in 2022 and has been the subject of several contentious hearings that have led to rulings that each side has claimed as victories.Lawyers for Associated Newspapers had argued that the case should be thrown out because claims dating as far back as 1993 were brought too late. But in a ruling saying the cases have a \"real prospect of succeeding\", Judge Matthew Nicklin said the papers had \"not been able to deliver a &#x27;knockout blow&#x27;\" to the claims.In the same ruling, Nicklin handed a win to the Mail in saying Harry and the others could not use records that allegedly showed payments by the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday to private investigators because they had been disclosed in confidence to a government inquiry into phone hacking.But Harry&#x27;s lawyers later got permission from UK government officials to use the documents.Private eye with conflicting claimsA private investigator whose name is on a sworn statement supporting the claims of Harry and the celebrities has filed another statement denying he ever snooped on them.During an early hearing in the case, Sherborne said his clients were not aware they were phone hacking victims until Gavin Burrows and other investigators came forward in 2021 to \"do the right thing\" and help those he targeted.Burrows said he \"must have done hundreds of jobs\" for the Mail between 2000 and 2005, and that Harry, John and his husband, David Furnish, and Hurley and Frost were \"just a small handful of my targets\".But he has since signed another statement saying he had not been hired by Associated Newspapers to do any unlawful work.It&#x27;s unclear what impact his conflicting statements will have on the case.The other claimants are anti-racism activist Doreen Lawrence and former politician Simon Hughes.",
