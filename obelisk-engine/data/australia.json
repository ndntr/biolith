          "content": "Former US President Bill Clinton told members of Congress on Friday that he \"did nothing wrong\" in his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and saw no signs of his abuse, yet he faced hours of grilling from lawmakers over his connections to the disgraced financier from more than two decades ago.\"I saw nothing, and I did nothing wrong,\" the former Democratic president said in an opening statement he shared on social media at the outside of the deposition.The closed-door deposition in Chappaqua, New York, marks the first time a former president has been compelled to testify to Congress.READ MORE: UN nuclear watchdog unable to verify Iran&#x27;s suspended uranium enrichment It came a day after Clinton&#x27;s wife, former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, sat with lawmakers for her own deposition.Bill Clinton has also not been accused of any wrongdoing.Yet lawmakers are grappling with what accountability in the United States looks like at a time when men around the world have been toppled from their high-powered posts for maintaining their connections with Epstein after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges in Florida for soliciting prostitution from an underage girl.\"Men — and women for that matter — of great power and great wealth from all across the world have been able to get away with a lot of heinous crimes and they haven&#x27;t been held accountable and they have not even had to answer questions,\" said Republican Rep. James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, before the deposition began Friday.Hillary Clinton told lawmakers Thursday that she had no knowledge of how Epstein had sexually abused underage girls and had no recollection of even meeting him. But Bill Clinton will have to answer questions on a well-documented relationship with Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, even if it was from the late 1990s and early 2000s.Bill Clinton in his opening statement said that he would likely often tell the committee that he did not recall the specifics of events from more than 20 years ago. But he also expressed certainty that he had not witnessed signs of Epstein&#x27;s abuse.https://twitter.com/BillClinton/status/2027424128559452573?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwStill, Republicans were relishing the opportunity to scrutinise the former Democratic president under oath.\"No one&#x27;s accusing anyone of any wrongdoing, but I think the American people have a lot of questions,\" Comer said.Republicans finally get a chance to question Bill ClintonRepublicans have wanted to question Bill Clinton about Epstein for years, especially as conspiracy theories arose following Epstein&#x27;s 2019 suicide in a New York jail cell while he faced sex trafficking charges.Those calls reached a fever pitch late last year when several photos of the former president surfaced in the Department of Justice&#x27;s first release of case files on Epstein and Maxwell, a British socialite who was convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021 but maintains she&#x27;s innocent.Bill Clinton was photographed on a plane seated alongside a woman, whose face is redacted, with his arm around her.Another photo showed Clinton and Maxwell in a pool with another person whose face was redacted.Epstein also visited the White House several times during Clinton&#x27;s presidency, and the pair later made several international trips together for their humanitarian work.Comer claimed the committee has collected evidence that Epstein visited the White House 17 times and that Bill Clinton flew on Epstein&#x27;s airplane 27 times.\"We are only here because he hid it from everyone so well for so long,\" Bill Clinton said in his opening statement. \"And by the time it came to light with his 2008 guilty plea, I had long stopped associating with him.\"Comer pledged extensive questioning of the former president. He claimed that Hillary Clinton had repeatedly deferred questions about Epstein to her husband.Bill Clinton went after Comer for calling his wife before the committee, telling him that \"including her was simply not right.\"The committee was working to quickly publish a transcript and video recording of her deposition.Has a precedent been set?Democrats, who have supported the push to get answers from Bill Clinton, are arguing that it sets a precedent that should also apply to US President Donald Trump, a Republican who had his own relationship with Epstein.\"I think that President Trump needs to man up, get in front of this committee and answer the questions and stop calling this investigation a hoax,\" said Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the committee, on Friday.Comer has pushed back on that idea, saying that Trump has answered questions on Epstein from the press.Democrats are also calling for the resignation of Trump&#x27;s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.Lutnick was a long-time neighbour of Epstein in New York City but said on a podcast that he severed ties with Epstein following a 2005 tour of Epstein&#x27;s home that disturbed Lutnick and his wife.The public release of case files showed that Lutnick actually had two engagements with Epstein years later. He attended a 2011 event at Epstein&#x27;s home, and in 2012 his family had lunch with Epstein on his private island.\"He should be removed from office and at a minimum should come before the committee,\" Garcia said of Lutnick.Republican Rep. Nancy Mace questioned Hillary Clinton about Lutnick&#x27;s relationship to Epstein during the deposition on Thursday.On Friday morning, Mace joined in calling for the commerce secretary to come before the committee.\"I believe we will have the votes to subpoena him,\" Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna said.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

Police said they found seven firearms, fake weapons, as well as a ballistics vest, gas masks, and lock-picking equipment at the house, which the man shared with his parents.They also seized several electronic devices, which are still being investigated.Police said they believe the man was acting alone and that there is no current threat to the community.READ MORE: Parents charged with domestic violence manslaughter of three-year-old son Blanch said the man was not known to authorities before his arrest, and that the firearms were owned legally.

The 20-year-old man was charged with one count of act in preparation for a terrorist act, the first time the charge has been used in the state.

          "content": "Pugapia and her daughters Aiga and Babawru lived for years as the only surviving members of the Akuntsu, an Indigenous people decimated by a government-backed push to develop parts of the Amazon rainforest. As they advanced in age without a child to carry on the line, many expected the Akuntsu to vanish when the women died.That changed in December, when Babawru — the youngest of the three, in her 40s — gave birth to a boy.READ MORE: Bill Clinton had no knowledge of Epstein crimes, says Hillary Clinton Akyp&#x27;s arrival brought hope not just for the Akuntsu line but also for efforts to protect the equally fragile rainforest.\"This child is not only a symbol of the resistance of the Akuntsu people, but also a source of hope for Indigenous peoples,\" said Joenia Wapichana, president of Brazil&#x27;s Indigenous protection agency, known as Funai. \"He represents how recognition, protection and the management of this land are extremely necessary.\"Protecting Indigenous territories is widely seen as one of the most effective ways to curb deforestation in the Amazon, the world&#x27;s largest rainforest and a key regulator of global climate. Researchers warn that continued forest loss could accelerate global warming. A 2022 analysis by MapBiomas, a network of nongovernmental groups tracking land use, found Indigenous territories in Brazil had lost just one per cent of native vegetation over three decades, compared with 20 per cent on private land nationwide.In Rondonia state, where the Akuntsu dwell, about 40 per cent of native forest has been cleared, and what remains untouched is largely within conservation and Indigenous areas. The Akuntsu&#x27;s land stands out in satellite images as an island of forest surrounded by cattle pasture as well as soy and corn fields.In the 1980s, deforestation pushed attacks in RondoniaRondonia&#x27;s deforestation traces back to a government-backed push to occupy the rainforest during Brazil&#x27;s military regime in the 1970s. Around the same time, an infrastructure program financed in part by the World Bank promoted domestic migration to the Amazon, including the paving of a highway across the state.In the 1980s, Rondonia&#x27;s population more than doubled, according to census data. Settlers were promised land titles if they cleared the forest for agriculture and risked losing claims if Indigenous people were present, fuelling violent attacks by hired gunmen on Indigenous groups such as the Akuntsu.Funai made first contact with the Akuntsu in 1995, finding seven survivors. Experts believe they had numbered about 20 a decade earlier, when they were attacked by ranchers seeking to occupy the area. Funai agents found evidence of the assault, and when they contacted the Akuntsu, the survivors recounted what happened. Some still bore gunshot wounds.The last Akuntsu man died in 2017. Since then, Babawru lived with her mother, Pugapia, and Aiga, her sister. The women, whose ages aren&#x27;t known for certain, have chosen to remain isolated from the non-Indigenous world, showing little interest in it.In 2006, Funai granted territorial protection to the Akuntsu, establishing the Rio Omere Indigenous Land, which they have since shared with the Kanoe people. The two groups, once enemies, began maintaining contact, usually mediated by officials. The relationship is complex, with cooperation but also cultural differences and language barriers.The Associated Press requested a facilitated interview with the women through Funai, but the agency didn&#x27;t respond.Amanda Villa, an anthropologist with the Observatory of Isolated Peoples, said Akuntsu women depend on Kanoe men for tasks considered masculine, such as hunting and clearing fields. The two groups have also exchanged spiritual knowledge — the current Kanoe spiritual leader, for example, learned from the late Akuntsu patriarch.But the most consequential development for the future of the Akuntsu may have occurred last year, when Babawru became pregnant by a Kanoe man.Linguist Carolina Aragon is the only outsider able to communicate with the three women after years studying and documenting their language. She works closely with Funai, translating conversations almost daily through video calls. Aragon also supported Babawru remotely during her labour and was with her during an ultrasound exam that confirmed the pregnancy.Aragon said Babawru was stunned by the news. \"She said, &#x27;How can I be pregnant?&#x27;\" Aragon recalled. Babawru had always taken precautions to avoid becoming pregnant.Social collapse shaped the Akuntsu&#x27;s choicesThe surviving Akuntsu women had decided they would not become mothers. The decision was driven not only by the absence of other men in their community, but also by the belief that their world was disorganised — conditions they felt were not suitable for raising a child.\"You can trace this decision directly to the violent context they lived through,\" said Villa, the anthropologist. \"They have this somewhat catastrophic understanding.\"The Akuntsu believed they could not bring new life into a world without Akuntsu men who could not only perform but also teach tasks the group considers male responsibilities, such as hunting and shamanism.\"A breakdown of social relations that followed the genocide shaped their lives and deepened over the years. That does lead people to think — and rethink — the future,\" Aragon said. \"But the future can surprise everyone. A baby boy was born.\"Aragon said the women were embarking on a \"new chapter,\" choosing to welcome the child and adapt their traditions with support from the Kanoe and Funai. Villa said the fact that the newborn is a boy creates the possibility of restoring male roles like hunter.Researchers and officials who have long worked with the three women understood that protecting the territory depended on the Akuntsu&#x27;s survival as a people. They sought to avoid a repeat of what happened to Tanaru, an Indigenous man who was discovered after living alone and without contact for decades.After the discovery, authorities struggled to protect Tanaru&#x27;s territory. After he died in 2022, non-Indigenous groups began disputing the land. Late last year, the federal government finally secured the area, turning it into a protected conservation unit.Funai&#x27;s Wapichana said Babawru&#x27;s child \"is a hope that this next generation will indeed include an Indigenous person, an Akuntsu, ensuring the continuity of this people.\"Through years of careful work, Funai secured territorial protection for the Akuntsu and helped foster ties with the Kanoe. The agency also arranged spiritual support from an allied shaman, allowing the women to feel safe bringing new life into the world after decades of fear and loss.The Akuntsu form emotional bonds with the forest and with the birds. Now, they are strengthening those bonds with a new human life in their world.\"What kind of relationship will this boy have with his own territory?\" Aragon said. \"I hope it will be the best possible, because he has everything he needs there.\"NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

Despite their discounts being removed, the customers allegedly continued to pay for the insurance. ASIC alleged the ads were misleading as the customers were not told they would lose their discounts if they made any changes.The regulator alleged Auto and General Services became aware of the issue as early as 2016 but failed to fix it or notify customers for years.\" Australians should be able to take insurers at their word, especially when it comes to discounts that influence their decision to take up a policy and compare it to other products in the market,\" ASIC deputy chair Sarah Court said.\"We allege Budget Direct&#x27;s conduct was misleading and deprived tens of thousands of Australians millions of dollars in savings they were promised.\"READ MORE: VB pins hopes on mid-strength as Aussies drop classic beersAuto and General Services has paid over $3.8 million in remediation, including interest, to the 39,661 affected customers but ASIC will seek declarations and civil penalties from the court.An Auto and General Services spokesperson said it self-reported the incident to ASIC, apologised to and financially compensated the customers.\"The matter only arose when the customers made an amendment to their policy during the first year – primarily either by replacing their insured car or changing their insured address,\" the Auto and General Services spokesperson said.\"In the past two years, Auto and General has invested more than $70 million in improvements to its systems and processes for managing its risk and compliance obligations and to prevent such an issue reoccurring.\"In addition, since this issue commenced, there has been a significant program of transformation to improve our culture of accountability and compliance.\"Auto and General is committed to continuing to provide affordable, comprehensive and dependable insurance solutions to our loyal customers.\"NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
