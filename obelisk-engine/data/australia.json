          "content": "A US federal judge has dismissed the indictments against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.The judge found that President Donald Trump&#x27;s appointment of interim US Attorney Lindsey Halligan in Alexandria, Virginia, was invalid.Trump handpicked Halligan for the role amid increasing pressure to bring criminal cases against his political enemies, including Comey and James.READ MORE: &#x27;Slender man&#x27; stabber back in custody after disappearance in US \"The Attorney General&#x27;s attempt to install Ms Halligan as Interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was invalid,\" Judge Cameron McGowan Currie wrote in her Monday order.According to Currie, \"all actions flowing from Ms Halligan&#x27;s defective appointment\" including the indictments against Comey and James \"were unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside.\"The judge tossed out the cases \"without prejudice,\" leaving open the possibility that the cases against Comey and James can be brought again alleging the same conduct. But McGowan Currie appeared to acknowledge in her ruling that for Comey, such a move may not be possible since the statute of limitations for his charges has now passed.READ MORE: Reggae giant and The Harder They Come movie star Jimmy Cliff dead at 81 CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.James issued a statement after the charges against her were dropped.\"I am heartened by today&#x27;s victory and grateful for the prayers and support I have received from around the country,\" she said.\"I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day.\"Why Halligan was unlawfully appointedHalligan, a former White House adviser, was selected for the role after the Trump administration pushed out the previous interim US attorney amid increasing pressure to bring cases against Comey and James.After determining Halligan&#x27;s appointment was invalid, the judge pointed to Trump&#x27;s classified documents case in explaining why dismissing the indictments was the proper remedy.In that case, Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the charges against Trump after finding Special Counsel Jack Smith was unlawfully appointed, in part because he too was not Senate confirmed. Trump had pleaded not guilty to taking classified documents from the White House and resisting the government&#x27;s attempts to retrieve the materials.READ MORE: Thai woman found alive in coffin after being brought in for cremation In the cases against Comey – which Halligan brought before a grand jury just days after her appointment – and James, defence attorneys argued the 120-day period that an interim US attorney is allowed to serve prior to confirmation from the Senate or approval from the district&#x27;s judges had already expired when Halligan took the position. This, they said, meant that Halligan&#x27;s appointment was unlawful.Currie agreed, writing that agreeing with the government&#x27;s position would give Trump and other officials authority \"to evade the Senate confirmation process indefinitely by stacking successive 120-day appointments.\"\"The 120-day clock began running with Mr Siebert&#x27;s appointment on January 21, 2025,\" she wrote, referring to Erik Siebert who had been serving as the interim US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia until he was pushed out in September.\"When that clock expired on May 21, 2025, so too did the Attorney General&#x27;s appointment authority,\" Currie wrote, adding that Attorney General Pam Bondi&#x27;s \"attempt to install\" Halligan \"was invalid and that Ms Halligan has been unlawfully serving in that role since September 22, 2025.\"Currie wrote the unlawful appointment should \"invalidate\" Halligan&#x27;s actions — including presenting those two indictments to grand juries.Prosecutors who work under Halligan previously argued Bondi has full authority to appoint whomever she wants to the position if they are qualified, and that the 120-day period serves as a sort of check-in system for those interim US Attorneys appointed.\"The implications of a contrary conclusion are extraordinary,\" Currie wrote of the Halligan appointment. \"It would mean the Government could send any private citizen off the street – attorney or not – into the grand jury room to secure an indictment so long as the Attorney General gives her approval after the fact. That cannot be the law.\"The cases against Comey and JamesProsecutors say Comey passed information along to reporters in 2017 through his attorney at the time and later made false statements during congressional testimony when asked about leaking information.He was charged in September with lying to and obstructing Congress during testimony in late 2020 and pleaded not guilty.Separately, James was indicted in October on one count of making false statements to a financial institution and one count of bank fraud, with prosecutors alleging she falsely claimed a property as a second home in order to receive a better interest rate. She also pleaded not guilty to the charges.Attorneys for Comey and James have both separately argued their cases were brought at the behest of the Trump administration because of the president&#x27;s personal animus toward them.Comey has been a constant critic of Trump and was fired by the president during the first months of his first term following the director&#x27;s handling of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.James, too, has been a long-time critic of Trump and filed a civil lawsuit against Trump over alleged value inflation of Trump properties. While a state judge found Trump liable and ordered him to pay over US$350 million ($541.4 million) in the case, a New York appeals court tossed the judgement, finding it \"excessive.\"Trump: &#x27;They&#x27;re all guilty as hell&#x27;As they fight the charges, Comey and James have pointed to a myriad of comments Trump has made calling for both individuals to be prosecuted and, in the case of James, have accused the government of \"transforming the Department of Justice into the President&#x27;s personal agents of revenge.\"Their attorneys pointed to one of Trump&#x27;s Truth Social posts, which was directed at Bondi, from September.\"Pam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, &#x27;same old story as last time, all talk, no action. Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam &#x27;Shifty&#x27; Schiff, Leticia??? They&#x27;re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,&#x27;\" Trump wrote in September, referring to Comey, James, and Senator Adam Schiff of California.The Justice Department argued, however, that the president&#x27;s social media posts weren&#x27;t directing Bondi to act, but simply saying he believed those people should be prosecuted because they&#x27;re guilty.What is Judge Cameron McGowan Currie&#x27;s role?Currie, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, ordinarily sits in South Carolina. She was appointed to the Halligan matter because other judges in the Eastern District of Virginia play a role in ensuring there is a top prosecutor in their district.When the chief judge of the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals tapped Currie to handle the challenges to Halligan, he said the move was being taken \"in the interest of maintaining public confidence in the impartial administration of justice.\"In May, the federal judges in the Eastern District of Virginia voted unanimously to keep Halligan&#x27;s predecessor, Siebert, whose 120-day stint as interim US Attorney was coming to a close, in the job.Among the judges who made the decision are US District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, who was later assigned Comey&#x27;s case, and Jamar Walker, who was later assigned to oversee James&#x27; case.Currie, who first started presiding over cases in The Palmetto State in 1994, stopped serving as a full-time judge in 2013.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Jimmy Cliff, the charismatic reggae pioneer and actor who preached joy, defiance and resilience in such classics as Many Rivers to Cross, You Can Get it If You Really Want and Vietnam and starred in the landmark movie The Harder They Come, has died at 81.His family posted a message Monday on his social media sites that he died from a \"seizure followed by pneumonia\". Additional information was not immediately available.\"To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career,\" the announcement reads in part. READ MORE: Savage storms dump enormous hail and rip off roofs\"He really appreciated each and every fan for their love.\"Cliff was a native Jamaican with a spirited tenor and a gift for catchphrases and topical lyrics who joined Kingston&#x27;s emerging music scene in his teens and helped lead a movement in the 1960s that included such future stars as Bob Marley, Toots Hibbert and Peter Tosh. By the early 1970s, he had accepted director Perry Henzell&#x27;s offer to star in a film about an aspiring reggae musician, Ivanhoe \"Ivan\" Martin, who turns to crime when his career stalls. Henzell named the movie The Harder They Come after suggesting the title as a possible song for Cliff.\"Ivanhoe was a real-life character for Jamaicans,\" Cliff told Variety in 2022, upon the film&#x27;s 50th anniversary.\"When I was a little boy, I used to hear about him as being a bad man. A real bad man. No one in Jamaica, at that time, had guns. But he had guns and shot a policeman, so he was someone to be feared. \"However, being a hero was the manner in which Perry wanted to make his name — an anti-hero in the way that Hollywood turns its bad guys into heroes.\"The Harder They Come, delayed for some two years because of sporadic funding, was the first major commercial release to come out of Jamaica. It sold few tickets in its initial run, despite praise from Roger Ebert and other critics. But it now stands as a cultural touchstone, with a soundtrack widely cited as among the greatest ever and as a turning point in reggae&#x27;s worldwide rise.READ MORE: Arrest after teen allegedly stabbed to death near schoolFor a brief time, Cliff rivalled Marley as the genre&#x27;s most prominent artist. On an album that included Toots and the Maytals, the Slickers and Desmond Dekker, Cliff was the featured artist on four out of 11 songs, all well placed in the reggae canon.Sitting in Limbo was a moody, but hopeful take on a life in restless motion. You Can Get it If You Really Want and the title song were calls for action and vows of final payments: \"The harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all.\"Cliff otherwise lets out a weary cry on Many Rivers to Cross, a gospel-style testament that he wrote after confronting racism in England in the 1960s.\"It was a very frustrating time. I came to England with very big hopes, and I saw my hopes fading,\" he told Rolling Stone in 2012.READ MORE: Parents break silence over horror jet-ski deathThe music lives onCliff&#x27;s career peaked with The Harder They Come, but, after a break in the late 1970s, he worked steadily for decades, whether session work with the Rolling Stones or collaborations with Wyclef Jean, Sting and Annie Lennox among others. Meanwhile, his early music lived on. The Sandinistas in Nicaragua used You Can Get it If You Really Want as a campaign theme and Bruce Springsteen helped expand Cliff&#x27;s US audience with his live cover of the reggae star&#x27;s Trapped, featured on the million-selling charity album from 1985, We Are the World. Others performing his songs included John Lennon, Cher and UB40.Cliff was nominated for seven Grammys and won twice for best reggae album: in 1986 for Cliff Hanger and in 2012 for the well-named Rebirth, widely regarded as his best work in years. His other albums included the Grammy-nominated The Power and the Glory, Humanitarian and the 2022 release Refugees. He also performed on Steve Van Zandt&#x27;s protest anthem, Sun City, and acted in the Robin Williams comedy Club Paradise, for which he contributed a handful of songs to the soundtrack and sang with Elvis Costello on the rocker Seven Day Weekend.In 2010, Cliff was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.He was born James Chambers in suburban Saint James and, like Ivan Martin in The Harder They Come, moved to Kingston in his youth to become a musician. In the early 1960s, Jamaica was gaining its independence from Britain and the early sounds of reggae — first called ska and rocksteady — were catching on. Calling himself Jimmy Cliff, he had a handful of local hits, including King of Kings and Miss Jamaica, and, after overcoming the kinds of barriers that upended Martin, was called on to help represent his country at the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair in New York City.\"(Reggae) is a pure music. It was born of the poorer class of people,\" he told Spin in 2022. \"It came from the need for recognition, identity and respect.\"Approaching stardomHis popularity grew over the second half of the 1960s, and he signed with Island Records, the world&#x27;s leading reggae label.Island founder Chris Blackwell tried in vain to market him to rock audiences, but Cliff still managed to reach new listeners. He had a hit with a cover of Cat Stevens&#x27; Wild World, and reached the top 10 in the UK with the uplifting Wonderful World, Beautiful People. Cliff&#x27;s widely heard protest chant, Vietnam, was inspired in part by a friend who had served in the war and returned damaged beyond recognition.His success as a recording artist and concert performer led Henzell to seek a meeting with him and flatter him into accepting the part.\"You know, I think you&#x27;re a better actor than singer,\" Cliff remembered him saying. Aware that The Harder They Come could be a breakthrough for Jamaican cinema, he openly wished for stardom, although Cliff remained surprised by how well known he became.\"Back in those days there were few of us African descendants who came through the cracks to get any kind of recognition,\" he told The Guardian in 2021. \"It was easier in music than movies. But when you start to see your face and name on the side of the buses in London that was like: &#x27;Wow, what&#x27;s going on?&#x27;\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
