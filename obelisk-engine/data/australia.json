Sydney eastern suburbs politicians including independent federal MP Allegra Spender and NSW Opposition Leader Kellie Sloane were the subject of inflammatory, misogynistic and violent threats after condemning a neo-Nazi rally outside NSW parliament in November.In December, a man was charged after several online threats were made to kill federal Communications Minister Anika Wells.Later that month, a 27-year-old Sydney man was arrested after allegedly threatening in online posts to kidnap Albanese.Albanese moved into The Lodge as his primary residence when he became prime minister, breaking with the pattern established by John Howard and continued by most of those who followed, who lived in Kirribilli House on Sydney Harbour.\"I&#x27;m already at The Lodge. I have moved most of my personal effects from my flat in Canberra there across to The Lodge plus some things down from Sydney,\" he told The Canberra Times at the time.\"It&#x27;s the national capital. And that is important. Family considerations are why I&#x27;ll spend time in Sydney as well.\"NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
