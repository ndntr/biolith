But coming from the country&#x27;s most powerful politician, it&#x27;s a significant escalation in the deterioration of diplomatic ties between two allies.READ MORE: Australia hurtling towards hidden crisisIsraeli opposition critical Israeli Opposition Leader Yair Lapid lashed out at Netanyahu over the comment.\"The thing that strengthens a leader in the democratic world today most is a confrontation with Netanyahu, the most politically toxic leader in the Western world,\" he said, on X. \"It is unclear why Bibi is in such a hurry to give the Australian prime minister this gift.\"Albanese was yet to respond on Tuesday night. Hours earlier Australian Finance Minister Katy Gallagher denied Australia&#x27;s relationship with Israel was broken and said Canberra was not trying to isolate Netanyahu&#x27;s government.https://x.com/IsraeliPM/status/1957722795049398502\"No, that is not the basis of the decisions that we&#x27;ve taken, we&#x27;ve taken decisions about recognition of the Palestinian state, based on, well, a frame view of a two-state solution and a pathway to peace,\" she said.\"We want diplomatic and open channels of discussion with the Israeli government. \"The PM takes it seriously, and that&#x27;s why we had those conversations, no matter how difficult they are with the prime minister and the prime minister of Israel.\"Australian opposition blames &#x27;failures of leadership&#x27;Opposition Leader Sussan Ley said the prime minister deserved respect but described it as a \"two-way street\" and pushed Albanese to \"explain how he is going to repair this relationship which is now in tatters as a result of his failures of leadership\".\"Anthony Albanese has mismanaged international relationships to the point where he now finds himself at the centre of a troubling diplomatic incident,\" she said, in a statement.\"This is a direct consequence of bad decisions he and his government have taken that do not advance Australia&#x27;s interests.\"Gaza&#x27;s Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, said the Palestinian death toll from 22 months of war has passed 62,000.It does not say how many were civilians or combatants, but says women and children make up around half the dead. The United Nations and other independent experts view its figures as the most reliable count of casualties.Israel announced plans to reoccupy Gaza City and other heavily populated areas after ceasefire talks stalled last month, raising the possibility of a worsening humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, which experts say is sliding into famine.Netanyahu has dismissed reports of starvation in Gaza as \"lies\" promoted by Hamas.But the UN last week warned that starvation and malnutrition in the occupied Palestinian territory are at their highest levels since the war began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, in which the militants abducted 251 people and killed about 1200, mostly civilians.Hamas says it has accepted a new Arab proposal in Gaza ceasefire talksHamas on Tuesday said it had accepted a proposal from Arab mediators for a ceasefire. Israel has not yet responded and says it is still committed to defeating the militant group.The latest proposal developed by Egypt and Qatar contains only slight modifications to an earlier one advanced by the United States and accepted by Israel, according to Egyptian and Hamas officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks.The deal would include a 60-day truce, the release of some of the hostages held by Hamas in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, a flood of humanitarian aid into Gaza and talks on a lasting ceasefire.Israel has vowed to continue the war until all the hostages are returned and Hamas is disarmed. US President Donald Trump gave support to those goals Monday in a social media post, saying Hamas must be \"confronted and destroyed\" to ensure the return of the remaining hostages.Netanyahu has said that while he will halt the fighting temporarily to facilitate the release of hostages, he will not end the war until Hamas has been defeated and disarmed.- with Associated Press DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
