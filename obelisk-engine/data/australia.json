          "content": "Naveed Akram has been charged with 59 offences after a terrorist incident that claimed the lives of 15 people and injured 41 more at Bondi Beach on Sunday. The 24-year-old awoke from a coma in hospital yesterday, after he was critically shot and hospitalised during an alleged shootout with police. The NSW Joint Counter Terrorism Team, comprised of NSW Police, AFP, ASIO and the NSW Crime Commission, this afternoon charged him with a slew of offences in relation to the incident.READ MORE: Radio saved the life of Bondi terror attack victimThe offences include 15 counts of murder, committing a terrorist act, 40 counts of causing wounding/grievous bodily harm to a person with intent to murder, discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, causing public display of a prohibited terrorist org symbol and placing an explosive in/near a building with intent to cause harm.Akram has faced court via a livestream from his hospital bed.He&#x27;s not well enough to be transferred to prison and will remain in hospital under police custody. He refused to speak with police, who waited three days for his medication to wear off before charging him today.\"For us to do that, it&#x27;s important that he has appropriate cognitive ability at the time when you&#x27;re on medication, we would argue for his fairness,\" NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said at a press conference earlier today.\"We need to make sure that he&#x27;s able to understand exactly what&#x27;s happening.\" 9News understands several lawyers were approached to represent Akram, but they refused. READ MORE: Emotional moment crowd sings &#x27;I am Australian&#x27; at Bondi Beach vigilInvestigators will allege officers arrived to find Naveed and his father Sajid Akram, 50, using long arm rifles to fire into crowds of people when they were called to Bondi Beach after 6.40pm on Sunday.Several officers exchanged shots with the alleged gunmen, and two officers were shot in the process.The alleged nine-minute assault came to an end when Sajid was shot dead, and Naveed was critically shot. A total of 15 people, aged between 10 and 87, were killed and another 41 people were injured.Police will allege in court that Naveed committed actions that caused death, serious injury and endangered life to advance a religious cause and cause fear in the community.\"Early investigations indicate it was an alleged terrorist attack inspired by ISIS, a listed terrorist organisation in Australia,\" a NSW Police statement reads. Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said early investigations indicate that no other individual is expected to face charges.READ MORE: How everyday Aussies can help in the wake of the Bondi shootingThe investigation has widened across borders, after it was confirmed that the father and son had visited the Philippines for a 28-day trip in November.Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos junior&#x27;s spokesperson, Claire Castro, said the leader rejected \"the misleading characterisation of the Philippines as an ISIS training hotspot\".\"Currently, there is no validated report or confirmation that the individuals involved in the Bondi Beach incident received any form of training in the Philippines,\" she said.\"Philippine authorities, in coordination with the international partners, continue to verify all available information, but no evidence has been presented to support claims that the country was used for terrorist training.\"Naveed is an Australian citizen, while his father, Sajid, was born in Hyderabad, India.Sajid migrated to Australia in 1998 but used his Indian passport to visit the Philippines.Authorities are speaking to his family and friends overseas, who say they had little to do with him for the past 30 years.

At least 16 people are dead, including one of the alleged killers.Here is what we know so far:On Sunday at 6.47pm local time, police and emergency services were called to Archer Park next to Sydney’s Bondi beach after reports of gunshots.Footage shared on social media showed two gunmen firing continuously at a large group who had gathered to celebrate the Jewish festival of Hanukah. Police alleged the pair used long arms to fire at crowds of people.At least 15 people were killed in the attack. Among the dead are Holocaust survivor Alexander Kleytman, London-born rabbi Eli Schlanger, French national Dan Elkayam, businessman Reuven Morrison, retired police officer Peter Meagher and a 10-year-old girl named Matilda. Police believe the oldest victim is 87.Forty-one people – including four children – were taken to hospital after the attack. As of 8pm Wednesday local time, there were 17 people in Sydney hospitals. One was in a critical condition, four were in a critical but stable condition and 15 were in a stable condition.Two police officers were among the injured. On Wednesday NSW police said one was in a critical but stable condition, while the other was in a stable condition.Police said they were treating the attack as an act of terrorism.The alleged gunmen were a 50-year-old, who was shot by police and died at the scene, and his 24-year-old son, who suffered critical injuries and was taken to hospital under police guard where he remained on Wednesday. The 24-year-old was in a coma but regained consciousness on Tuesday, NSW police confirmed.Media have identified them as Naveed Akram and his father, Sajid Akram.On Wednesday, NSW police said they had formally charged the 24-year-old had been charged with 59 offences, including committing a terrorist attack, 15 counts of murder and 40 counts of wounding or grievous bodily harm with intent to murder. He has also been charged with discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, causing a public display of a prohibited terrorist organisation symbol and placing an explosive in or near a building with intent to cause harm.Police said they will allege in court the man “engaged in conduct that caused death, serious injury and endangered life to advance a religious cause and cause fear in the community”. Police said “early indications point to a terrorist attack inspired by Isis, a listed terrorist organisation in Australia”.Naveed Akram is an Australian-born citizen, the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, said. His father arrived in 1998 on a student visa, transferred in 2001 to a partner visa and, after trips overseas, had been on resident return visas three times.New South Wales police and the director general of Asio, Mike Burgess, said one of the shooters was known to authorities, “but not in an immediate threat perspective”.Both Naveed and Sajid Akram travelled to the Philippines in November, but Lanyon said the reason for their travel and what they did when they while there was still under investigation.According to an Agence France-Press report, a Filipino immigration department spokesperson said the pair arrived in the country on 1 November and left on 28 November. Sajid Akram entered the country as an “Indian national”, according to the spokesperson.The NSW police commissioner, Mal Lanyon, said Sajid Akram was a licensed firearms holder with six guns. On Tuesday, Lanyon clarified that Akram applied for a licence in 2015 but it lapsed as he did not get a photo taken. He applied again in 2020 and the licence was issued in 2023.Bomb disposal experts removed two active improvised explosive devices from a car registered to Naveed Akram the scene. Police said on Monday a third IED was located at Bondi.The car registered to Naveed also contained two homemade Islamic State flags, Lanyon said on Tuesday. Continue reading...",

          "content": "One of the police officers wounded by gunfire during Sunday&#x27;s mass shooting at Bondi Beach has lost sight in one eye and faces a long road to recovery, his family has revealed.Probationary Constable Jack Hibbert was one of two police officers left in a critical condition after he was shot while confronting two gunmen who opened fire on a Jewish Hanukkah festival on Sunday evening.NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said he visited Hibbert and his family this morning.LIVE UPDATES: Investigators working with Philippines over accused shooters&#x27; trip; alleged gunman wakes from coma\"I&#x27;m really pleased to say that Jack was awake this morning, we had a lovely conversation, he&#x27;s a really positive young man,\" Lanyon said.\" Tragically we know that he&#x27;s going to lose the sight in one eye as a result of his injuries on the weekend.\"Jack is incredibly comforted by the knowledge that as his commissioner I have given him an undertaking that we will support him.\" We will find appropriate duties for him, depending on the nature of that injury and his capacity.\" His family wanted to say thank you to the many members of the community who have provided messages of support to them and the overwhelming support of the blue family.\"Lanyon confirmed Hibbert&#x27;s colleague, Constable Scott Dyson , underwent further surgery this morning.\"He remains in a critical and stable condition,\" Lanyon said. \"Our thoughts and all of our prayers are with him and his family.\" For both officers, it will be a long road to recovery.The policing family has wrapped around both officers and will ensure that we are there for the long run.\"Hibbert&#x27;s family issued a statement through NSW Police earlier today.READ MORE: There are over 1.1 million legal guns in NSW. New laws in the wake of the Bondi attack could drastically shrink this figureStatement from the Hibbert family: On the 14th of December, Jack Hibbert was shot while fulfilling his role as a police officer at Bondi Beach.While serving and protecting the community, Jack sustained two bullet wounds - one to his head and another to his shoulder. Jack was on duty, patrolling the Hanukkah celebration interacting with the community at Bondi Beach, when the incident first occurred.Jack was taken to ICU where he was intubated and underwent multiple surgeries. Although miraculously surviving, Jack&#x27;s injuries have resulted in a loss of vision in one of his eyes and he now faces a long and challenging recovery ahead, with additional surgeries required.READ MORE: Islamic State links at centre of terror attack probeJack is just 22 years old and has only been in the police force for four months. Even so, in the face of a violent and tragic incident, he responded with courage, instinct, and selflessness, continuing to protect and help others whilst injured, until he was physically no longer able to.Jack was simply doing his job - a job he deeply loves - driven by a commitment to protect the community, even at great personal cost.Many of his colleagues who were present on the night of the incident have visited in hospital and given testaments to Jack&#x27;s bravery during the incident, describing his devotion to his community. They described how Jack acted, he moved toward people in need, not away from danger, and continued helping others while seriously injured.READ MORE: Radio saved the life of Bondi terror attack victimThe support from the police force and hospital staff has been unmatched and we are beyond grateful.We thank the wider community for their kindness, support, and prayers for Jack and our family during this difficult time.We ask all to respect our privacy as we move through these next stages to support Jack and all his needs to a full recovery.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
