Freeman is believed to be heavily armed as police continue to search over 100 properties and acres of bushland.Police have previously stated that they believe some people might know his whereabouts or are potentially harbouring the alleged killer. READ MORE: Surfer killed by a shark at popular Sydney beach \"This could be sightings of Freeman, information you&#x27;re hearing in your local communities, even suspicious activity on your property – whatever it is, we want you to tell us,\" Thomas said.\"I would also like to stress to members of the public that if you see Freeman, then we need you to call triple zero immediately because this will give police the very best chance of apprehending him.\"Freeman has killed two people and injured a third, and it&#x27;s immensely important that we can bring him into custody safely as soon as possible – hopefully this reward helps do just that.\"Authorities remain open to the possibility that Freeman is still alive or could potentially be dead as a result of self-harm.They hope this reward for information leading to his arrest will be an incentive. More than 450 officers are dedicated to the search each day with \"no talk\" of reducing those numbers, Victoria Police said.
