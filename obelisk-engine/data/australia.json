New laws in the wake of the Bondi attack could drastically shrink this figureStatement from the Hibbert family: On the 14th of December, Jack Hibbert was shot while fulfilling his role as a police officer at Bondi Beach.While serving and protecting the community, Jack sustained two bullet wounds - one to his head and another to his shoulder. Jack was on duty, patrolling the Hanukkah celebration interacting with the community at Bondi Beach, when the incident first occurred.Jack was taken to ICU where he was intubated and underwent multiple surgeries. Although miraculously surviving, Jack&#x27;s injuries have resulted in a loss of vision in one of his eyes and he now faces a long and challenging recovery ahead, with additional surgeries required.READ MORE: Islamic State links at centre of terror attack probeJack is just 22 years old and has only been in the police force for four months. Even so, in the face of a violent and tragic incident, he responded with courage, instinct, and selflessness, continuing to protect and help others whilst injured, until he was physically no longer able to.Jack was simply doing his job - a job he deeply loves - driven by a commitment to protect the community, even at great personal cost.Many of his colleagues who were present on the night of the incident have visited in hospital and given testaments to Jack&#x27;s bravery during the incident, describing his devotion to his community. They described how Jack acted, he moved toward people in need, not away from danger, and continued helping others while seriously injured.READ MORE: Radio saved the life of Bondi terror attack victimThe support from the police force and hospital staff has been unmatched and we are beyond grateful.We thank the wider community for their kindness, support, and prayers for Jack and our family during this difficult time.We ask all to respect our privacy as we move through these next stages to support Jack and all his needs to a full recovery.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
