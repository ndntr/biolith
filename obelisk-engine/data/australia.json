          "content": "P rime Minister Anthony Albanese has buckled after weeks of intense pressure and called a Commonwealth royal commission after the Bondi Beach terrorist attack.After reports began to emerge this afternoon he was considering the move, Albanese confirmed he will recommend the governor-general establish a national probe in a snap press conference.He said the inquiry would be led by former High Court justice Virginia Bell and would examine antisemitism and social cohesion in Australia.READ MORE: &#x27;Ripped of my identity&#x27;: Bondi terror victim says name was changed in hospital\" One of the reasons our nation is one of the oldest and strongest modern democracies in the world is because every Australian has the right to express their view, and as prime minister, I respect people&#x27;s views, and I listen to them, I take the time to choose the right path, the course of action that will make a positive difference to our country,\" he said.\"I&#x27;ve repeatedly said that our government&#x27;s priority is to promote unity and social cohesion, and this is what Australia needs to heal, to learn, to come together in a spirit of national unity and to go forward.\"It&#x27;s clear to me that a royal commission is essential to achieving this.\"The review into the effectiveness of federal agencies that is currently under way will be folded into the royal commission, but will still deliver an interim report as expected in April.The planned NSW royal commission into the incident has been scrapped, following the announcement today.The Commonwealth royal commission will cover four areas as set out in the terms of reference:Tackling antisemitism by investigating the nature and prevalence of antisemitismMaking any recommendations to enforcement, border immigration and security agencies to tackle antisemitism, including through improvements to guidance and training within law enforcement, border control, immigration and security agencies to respond to antisemitic conduct Examine the circumstances around the Bondi Beach terrorist attack aided by the Richardson reviewMake any other recommendations arising out of the inquiry for strengthening social cohesion in Australia and countering the spread of ideological and religiously motivated extremism in AustraliaBell will be required to hand down her report before the first anniversary of the Bondi attack on December 14 this year. \"This won&#x27;t be a drawn-out process,\" Albanese said, after previously saying that royal commissions take years to hand down a report and only delay changes.READ MORE: Bondi terror attack hero recounts his story in front of millionsAlbanese had repeatedly knocked back calls from some of the families of the victims of the Bondi attack, members of his own party, the opposition and the Jewish community to open a federal royal commission, instead opting for more immediate action.He is expected to recall parliament early sometime this month to introduce a range of reforms announced by the federal government, including a landmark gun buyback scheme, hate speech laws, a new offence targeting the radicalisation of children , and more powers for the home affairs minister to cancel or refuse visas if a person is suspected of promoting violence or hate or is associated with a terrorist organisation.The prime minister fended off questions from reporters about his backflip today, reiterating that he has been working on a royal commission for weeks after listening to the calls and meeting with members of the Jewish community.\"I&#x27;ve engaged constructively regardless of some of the things that have been said. I haven&#x27;t engaged in politics. I have been focused on outcomes. That&#x27;s the first point,\" he said.\"The second is I&#x27;ve listened and, in a democracy, that&#x27;s a good thing to listen to what people are saying.\"Opposition Leader Sussan Ley said she would review the terms of reference, while criticising the appointment of only one royal commissioner and the delay in opening the national probe.\"Caving under pressure does not absolve this prime minister or his government of their failures,\" she said.Albanese has assured that the royal commission would not prejudice the court process for the alleged lone surviving gunman, Naveed Akram, due to Bell&#x27;s experience.\"I have confidence in the royal commission. It&#x27;s one of the reasons why we chose someone who has a criminal law background, has been in senior positions in the Supreme Court and the High Court of Australia,\" he said.\"She&#x27;s the most qualified person we could possibly consider.\"Albanese will formally recommend Governor-General Sam Mostyn to establish the Commonwealth royal commission at an executive council meeting tomorrow.
