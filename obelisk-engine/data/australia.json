          "content": "Hurricane Melissa has made landfall in Jamaica as a catastrophic Category 5 storm, one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes in history.The US National Hurricane Centre in Miami warned of devastating flash flooding and numerous landslides from the hurricane with 295km/h winds.The streets in the capital, Kingston, remained largely empty before Melissa made landfall about midday on Tuesday (4am AEDT), save for the lone stray dog crossing puddles and a handful of people walking briskly under tree branches waving in a stiff wind.READ MORE: Gas to be outlawed in Australia&#x27;s biggest cityDesmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica&#x27;s Disaster Risk Management Council, urged people to seek shelter and stay indoors as the storm crosses the island.\"Jamaica, this is not the time to be brave,\" he said.The Jamaican government said it had done all it could to prepare as it warned of devastating damage from the strongest hurricane to hit the island since record-keeping began 174 years ago.\"There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness said.\"The question now is the speed of recovery. That&#x27;s the challenge.\"Massive wind damage is expected in Melissa&#x27;s core and Jamaica&#x27;s highest mountains could see gusts of up to 322km/h, said US National Hurricane Centre director Michael Brennan.\"It&#x27;s going to be a very dangerous scenario,\" he said, warning that there would be \"total building failures\".Melissa is the fifth most intense Atlantic basin hurricane on record by pressure, and the strongest such hurricane to make landfall since Hurricane Dorian in 2019, according to hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry.It is \"a worst-case scenario unfolding for Jamaica,\" he said.Landslides, fallen trees and numerous power outages were reported ahead of the storm, with officials in Jamaica cautioning that the cleanup and damage assessment would be slow.A life-threatening storm surge of up to four metres is expected across southern Jamaica, with officials concerned about the impact on some hospitals along the coastline.Health Minister Christopher Tufton said some patients were relocated from the ground floor to the second floor, \"and (we) hope that will suffice for any surge that will take place\".The storm already was blamed for seven deaths in the Caribbean, including three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic, where another person remains missing.\"We will get through it together,\" said Evan Thompson, principal director at Jamaica&#x27;s meteorological service.Jamaica braces for catastrophic damageColin Bogle, a Mercy Corps advisor based near Kingston, said most families are sheltering in place despite the government ordering evacuations in flood-prone communities.\"Many have never experienced anything like this before, and the uncertainty is frightening,\" he said. \"There is profound fear of losing homes and livelihoods, of injury, and of displacement.\"Necephor Mghendi, the international Red Cross&#x27; regional head of delegation for the English- and Dutch-speaking Caribbean, said that an estimated 1.5 million people in the storm&#x27;s path will be affected, but many others may be as well.More than 240,000 customers were without power before landfall and about one-fourth of the telecommunications system was offline, said Darryl Vaz, transport and energy minister. He said crews will clean and run tests at the island&#x27;s two main international airports Wednesday in hopes of receiving emergency relief flights as early as Thursday.UN agencies and dozens of nonprofits had food, medicine and other essential supplies positioned as they awaited a distribution rush after the storm.Matthew Samuda, Jamaica&#x27;s water and environment minister, said he had more than 50 generators available to deploy after the storm, but warned people to set aside clean water and use it sparingly.\"Every drop will count,\" he said.READ MORE: Aussies demand Woolies bring back staples quietly vanishing from storesMelissa takes aim at CubaMelissa also was expected to make landfall in eastern Cuba late on Tuesday as a powerful hurricane.A hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantánamo and Holguin provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Las Tunas.

          "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has ordered the army to immediately carry out \"powerful strikes\" in Gaza, a new test for the tenuous US-brokered ceasefire.The order from Netanyahu on Tuesday (early Wednesday AEDT) follows heightened tensions, as Israel reported Hamas firing on its forces in southern Gaza and after Hamas returned a set of remains that Israel said belonged to a hostage recovered earlier in the war.Netanyahu called the return a \"clear violation\" of the ceasefire agreement, which requires Hamas to return all Israeli hostage remains as soon as possible.READ MORE: Et tu: More schools revealed to have been teaching wrong subjectIn a sign of the fragility of the ceasefire, Israeli troops were shot at in the southern city of Rafah on Tuesday and returned fire, according to an Israeli military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because there hasn&#x27;t been an official announcement yet.There are still 13 bodies of hostages in Gaza. Hamas said Tuesday it has recovered the body of a hostage that it plans to hand over this evening.An Associated Press videographer in Khan Younis witnessed what appeared to be a white body bag being carried out from a tunnel by several men, including some masked militants, and then transported into an ambulance. It was not immediately clear what was in the bag.The slow return of hostages&#x27; bodies is posing a challenge to implementing the next stages of the ceasefire, which will address even knottier issues, such as the disarmament of Hamas, the deployment of an international security force in Gaza and deciding who will govern the territory.Hamas has said it is struggling to locate the bodies amid the vast destruction in Gaza, while Israel has accused the militant group of purposely delaying their return. Over the weekend, Egypt deployed a team of experts and heavy equipment to help search for the bodies of the remaining hostages. That work continued Tuesday in Khan Younis and Nuseirat.This is the second time since the ceasefire began on October 10 that remains turned over by Hamas have been problematic. Israel said one of the bodies Hamas released in the first week of the ceasefire belonged to an unidentified Palestinian.During a previous ceasefire in February 2025, Hamas said it handed over the bodies of three hostages, Shiri Bibas and her two sons, but testing showed that one of the bodies returned was identified as a Palestinian woman. Shiri Bibas&#x27; body was returned a day later.READ MORE: &#x27;No infrastructure can withstand&#x27; MelissaA stricken familyThe remains returned overnight into Tuesday have been identified as belonging to Ofir Tzarfati, Netanyahu&#x27;s office said.Tzarfati was kidnapped from the Nova music festival in the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel that started the war. In all, the militants killed some 1200 people that day, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages.Tzarfati was killed in captivity and his body was retrieved by Israeli troops in November 2023. In March 2024, his family received additional remains for burial.Tzarfati&#x27;s family said in a statement that this is the third time \"we have been forced to open Ofir&#x27;s grave and rebury our son\".In exchange for 15 dead hostages returned from Gaza since the ceasefire began, Israel has handed back to Gaza 195 Palestinian bodies. The last 20 living hostages were returned to Israel at the start of the ceasefire, and in exchange, Israel freed roughly 2000 Palestinian prisoners.READ MORE: Government immediately reinstates puberty block banIsrael kills three Palestinians in a West Bank raidEarlier on Tuesday, Israeli authorities said they had killed three Palestinian militants early during an operation in the northern part of the occupied West Bank, the latest action in Israel&#x27;s stepped-up military activity in the territory since the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack.Israeli police said the three men were shot as they came out of a cave near Jenin, a town in the northern West Bank known as a militant stronghold. The Israeli military said in a statement that the militants \"took part in terror activity in Jenin\", but gave no further details.Two militants were shot and killed in the initial volley of gunfire. The third, who was wounded, was killed shortly after, according to the Israeli military.An earlier statement said the Israeli military carried out an airstrike shortly afterward to destroy the cave. The army confirmed an airstrike in the area but gave no further details.Hamas condemned the Jenin strike and later identified two of the three men as militants with Hamas&#x27; Qassam Brigades. The third man was referred to as a \"comrade\", but no additional details about him were given.Israel says its operations have cracked down on militants in the West Bank. But Palestinians and human rights groups say scores of uninvolved civilians have also been among the dead, while tens of thousands of people have been displaced from their homes.More than 68,500 Palestinians have died in the two-year war in Gaza, according to Gaza&#x27;s Health Ministry, which doesn&#x27;t distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by UN agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
