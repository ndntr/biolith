READ MORE: Local mayor describes &#x27;escalating dingo aggression&#x27; The surrounding camp zones have been closed and rangers are warning tourists to beware.\"At the moment it&#x27;s a police matter, and our response to any risk mitigation is increased patrols in the area,\" ranger Linda Behrendorff said.Today, rangers and police searched the dunes near the scene as the young woman&#x27;s body undergoes an autopsy in Brisbane to determine if and how the dingoes contributed to her death.The potential that the island&#x27;s iconic predators could be responsible has stunned locals and tourists alike.\" We&#x27;ve fortunately come out of a peak period, a holiday period over the Christmas holidays where there were very limited high-risk behaviour from dingoes to visitors\" Behrendorff said.If dingoes are to blame, it would be the first death from an attack in 25 years. Fraser Coast Mayor George Seymour described James&#x27; death as a \"massive tragedy\".\"I think that if this is found to be a fatal dingo attack, there will have to be a review of the dingo management strategy,\" Seymour said.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
