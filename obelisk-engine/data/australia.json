READ MORE: Aussie event in limbo as board members and chair quit over axingThe government will move a condolence motion to acknowledge the 15 victims of the attack before debating the \"combating antisemitism hate and extremism\" bill.The bill includes a package of reforms, including a landmark gun buyback scheme, increasing penalties for hate crimes, creating a new offence for hate preachers radicalising children and inciting hatred to intimidate and harass, expanding the ban on prohibited symbols and granting more powers for the Home Affairs department to cancel or refuse visas for people who spread hatred.For example, racial vilification could be punished by up to five years&#x27; imprisonment. \"The terrorists at Bondi Beach had hatred in their minds but guns in their hands. This law will deal with both,\" Albanese said. The legislative package will also lower the threshold for what is considered a hate group, with Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke signalling the neo-Nazi group National Socialist Network and Hizb ut-Tahrir will be captured under the proposed change.READ MORE: Bondi hero reveals &#x27;trauma&#x27; after seeing video of confrontation with gunman\"For a while, they have created a pathway for others to engage in violence, (but) have been careful to not explicitly call for it themselves,\" he said.\"They&#x27;ve kept themselves just below that threshold.\"This bill will lower that threshold, and lower that threshold to the extent that we can within the Constitution.\" ASIO chief Mike Burgess called out both organisations for testing the \"limits of legality\" while fuelling division in a speech about foreign interference in November.The bill will be released to the public and open to submissions tomorrow.The prime minister will brief Opposition Leader Sussan Ley and Greens leader Larissa Waters on the draft legislation this afternoon and is hopeful it will pass by Tuesday afternoon.\"I would expect that there will be cooperation,\" he said. \"I&#x27;m hoping that the laws can be passed efficiently and quickly with the support of the entire parliament.\" DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
