He added that it is \"vital for the Golden Dome that we are building,\" in reference to the missile defence system the Pentagon is developing. He also argued that NATO leaders should be pushing for the United States to have Greenland.\"NATO should be leading the way for us to get it. IF WE DON&#x27;T, RUSSIA OR CHINA WILL, AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN! Militarily, without the vast power of the United States, much of which I built during my first term, and am now bringing to a new and even higher level, NATO would not be an effective force or deterrent - Not even close! They know that, and so do I,\" Trump wrote in the post.READ MORE: At least 22 killed, 64 injured after crane collapses onto train in Thailand On Tuesday, Trump had dismissed comments from Greenland&#x27;s Premier Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who said at a news conference in Copenhagen: \"Greenland does not want to be owned by the USA. Greenland does not want to be governed by the USA. Greenland will not be part of the USA. We choose the Greenland we know today, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"In response, Trump said, \"That&#x27;s their problem. I disagree with him. I don&#x27;t know who he is. Don&#x27;t know anything about him, but that&#x27;s going to be a big problem for him.\"Several factors, accentuated by the climate crisis, make Greenland an important strategic region, such as its geopolitical position, its rich natural resources (including oil, gas and rare earth minerals) and the potential northern shipping routes around it.While Trump has downplayed the significance of Greenland&#x27;s natural resources, Mike Waltz highlighted last year when he was Trump&#x27;s incoming national security adviser that the administration&#x27;s focus on the territory was also \"about critical minerals\" and \"natural resources.\"Denmark increases military presence in GreenlandThe government of Greenland and Denmark&#x27;s Ministry of Defence announced there would be an increased military presence in and around the territory starting on Wednesday due to \"security tensions\".Denmark said its armed forces were \"deploying capacities and units in connection with exercise activities from today, which will result in an increased military presence in and around Greenland of aircraft, ships and soldiers, including from NATO allies, in the coming period.\"It added that the expanded exercise activities could include guarding critical infrastructure, providing assistance to Greenlandic authorities – including police – receiving allied troops, deploying fighter aircraft in and around Greenland, and naval operations.Sweden has also sent an unspecified number of troops to Greenland, following Denmark&#x27;s request to do so, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson announced on X.European leaders have rejected Trump&#x27;s calls to control Greenland. French President Emmanuel Macron warned on Wednesday that the knock-on effects of the US trying to seize Greenland from Denmark would be \"unprecedented.\"\"We do not underestimate the statements regarding Greenland. If the sovereignty of a European and allied country were to be affected, the knock-on consequences would be unprecedented,\" Macron said, according to his government&#x27;s spokesperson. He added that France is monitoring the situation and \"will conduct its actions in full solidarity with Denmark and its sovereignty\".Earlier on Wednesday, the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, reiterated that Greenland belongs to its people, so it is up to Denmark and Greenland to decide its future.\"For me, it is important Greenlanders know … that we respect (their) wishes and they, they can count on us,\" she added.Trump suggested over the weekend that he would move forward with his goal to acquire Greenland with or without a deal.\"I&#x27;d love to make a deal with them. It&#x27;s easier. But one way or the other, we&#x27;re going to have Greenland,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One.Asked about the possibility of the move compromising NATO, Trump said, \"I&#x27;m the one that saved NATO.\"He stopped short of saying he would pull the US out of NATO, adding, \"maybe they would be upset\" if he took Greenland but expressing indifference about the effects of such a move: \"If it affects NATO, then it affects NATO.\"Pressed by CNN on Sunday whether he would increase the amount of US military bases on Greenland in the meantime, Trump said, \"We could put a lot of soldiers there right now if I want, but you need more than that. You need ownership. You really need title.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "A construction crane crashed onto a moving passenger train in north-eastern Thailand on Wednesday, triggering a derailment that killed at least 32 people and injured dozens more.The crash occurred in Nakhon Ratchasima, some 200 kilometers northeast of Bangkok, on a section of a planned high-speed rail project that is intended to eventually connect China with much of Southeast Asia.The province&#x27;s Public Health Provincial Office said there were 32 fatalities and 64 injured victims, including seven with severe injuries. READ MORE: Donald Trump flips off, appears to swear at hecklerThere were still three passengers missing among the 171 believed to have been on board the train, it said in a statement issued as night fell.Authorities said the crane was being used to build an elevated part of the railway when it fell as the train was travelling from the capital, Bangkok, to Ubon Ratchathani province. Thailand&#x27;s Rail Transport Department said the crane was what is called a launching gantry crane, a self-supporting structure with vertical legs that usually runs on rails or wheels for mobility, allowing it to progress along with the construction project that it straddles. Such cranes are often used to help build elevated roads.Images published in Thai media showed plumes of white, then dark, smoke rising from the crash site, with construction equipment dangling from girders between two concrete support pillars.Rescue workers pull survivors from mangled, overturned carriagesRescue workers stood on top of overturned railway carriages, some of them with gaping holes torn on their sides, video from public broadcaster ThaiPBS showed. What appeared to be sections of the crane were scattered along the track.Samai Teechantuek, 62, whose house is about 100 meters from the site of the accident, told The Associated Press of the horror of witnessing the accident, and hearing \"the noises screeching, and then bam, bam, bam, all the way over there.\"\"When the dust settled, I saw the top of the train carriage. I heard people shouting &#x27;save the children first!&#x27;\" she said. \"A conductor pulled people out. I saw them pulling many people out. People from the shop over there also ran out to help.\"\"My legs were shaking. I was standing there shaking. I didn&#x27;t dare going any closer,\" she said.Transport Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn said he ordered an investigation.In August 2024, a railway tunnel on the planned route, also in Nakhon Ratchasima, collapsed, killing three workers. Days of heavy rainfall were believed to have been a factor in the collapse.The elevated segment that collapsed is a part of a Thai-Chinese high-speed railway project linking the capital to the northeastern province of Nong Khai, bordering Laos. The two-stage rail project has a total investment cost of more than 520 billion baht ($24.8 billion) and is associated with an ambitious plan to connect China with Southeast Asia under Beijing&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative. The section where the accident took place had a budget of more than 179 billion baht ($8.5 billion) and according to its original plans was expected to start operating in 2027.Anan Phonimdaeng, acting governor of the State Railway of Thailand, said the project&#x27;s contractor is Italian-Thai Development, with a Chinese company responsible for design and construction supervision. He said he ordered the contractor to suspend operations at the site until the investigation of the accident is completed.Anan said authorities will examine the responsibilities of both parties, and the Railway Department plans to take legal action against the contractor as a first step. Damage to the train was estimated to be more than 100 million baht ($4.8 million), while construction equipment suffered limited damage, he said.A statement posted on the company&#x27;s website expressed condolences to the victims and said the company would take responsibility for paying compensation to the families of the dead and hospitalisation expenses for the injured.The main contractor for the route&#x27;s first stage between Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima, Italian-Thai Development, was also the directly responsible for construction of the segment where Wednesday&#x27;s accident occurred.Main contractor was tied to last year&#x27;s Bangkok building collapseThe rail accident sparked outrage because the company, also known as Italthai, was also the co-lead contractor for the State Audit Building in the Thai capital Bangkok, which collapsed during construction in March during a major earthquake.About 100 people were killed in the collapse, which was the only major structure in Thailand to suffer such serious damage. Dozens of executives were indicted in connection with the disaster but none have yet been tried.The involvement of Chinese companies in both projects has also drawn attention, as has Italthai&#x27;s and Chinese companies&#x27; involvement in the construction of several expressway extensions in and around Bangkok where several accidents, some fatal, had occurred.Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, who was interior minister when the State Audit Building collapsed, said that the Comptroller General&#x27;s Department and Transport Ministry are responsible for blacklisting contractors, and the laws could not be amended in the brief time he was interior minister to expedite the matter.In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the government was aware of the reports about the accident and had expressed condolences.\"The Chinese government attaches great importance to the safety of projects and personnel, and we are also learning about the situation,\" she said. \"At present, it appears that the relevant section is being constructed by a Thai company, and the cause of the accident is still under investigation.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
