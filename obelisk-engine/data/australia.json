          "content": "The fragile ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war has been tested as the slower-than-hoped return of deceased hostages from Gaza prompted an Israeli military agency to declare a \"violation\" of the truce agreement.The agency said it would respond to by halving the number of trucks allowed to bring humanitarian aid into the devastated territory.Word of the cut in aid was transmitted to US officials and international aid groups, according to three AP sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter. The Israeli government did not immediately comment on Tuesday (early Wednesday AEDT).A day earlier, Israelis celebrated the return of the last 20 living hostages in Gaza and Palestinians rejoiced at Israel&#x27;s release of some 2000 prisoners and detainees as part of the ceasefire&#x27;s first phase.But now attention in Israel has turned to when Hamas will return all the bodies of hostages who died in captivity. While Israeli officials had understood there could be some delay in the recovery effort, the families of hostages and their supporters expressed dismay that only four of the 28 bodies were returned on Monday.The Hostages Family Forum, a grassroots organisation representing many of the hostage families, called it a \"blatant violation of the agreement by Hamas\".The top official in Israel coordinating the return of hostages and the missing, Gal Hirsch, told the families in a note that pressure was being applied on Hamas through international mediators to expedite the process. A copy of the note was seen by The Associated Press and its authenticity was confirmed by someone with knowledge of the statement.In Gaza, the Health Ministry said on Tuesday that the bodies of three people killed by the Israeli military in the northern part of the territory were taken to Al Ahli hospital.The Israeli military said troops there had \"opened fire to remove the threat\" of several people approaching them and not complying with orders to stop. It didn&#x27;t immediately comment on any casualties.Under the ceasefire deal, Israeli forces pulled back to where they were in August, before launching their latest offensive on the Gaza City. The pullback leaves a number of hard-hit Palestinian neighbourhoods under Israeli control, and Israel has warned residents not to try to return to homes there.Dismay over the release of only four deceased hostages from GazaOn Tuesday, the Israeli military identified two of the dead hostages returned from Gaza a day earlier — Guy Illouz from Israel and Bipin Joshi, a student from Nepal.Both were in their 20s when Hamas-led militants took them during the October 7, 2023, attack on that ignited the war. Illouz was abducted from a music festival and Joshi from a bomb shelter.Israel said Illouz died of his wounds while being held captive without proper medical treatment, while Joshi was murdered in captivity in the first months of the war.The ceasefire plan introduced by US President Donald Trump called for \"all hostages, alive and deceased\" to be returned within 72 hours of the agreement&#x27;s acceptance.But it also provided a mechanism if that didn&#x27;t happen, saying Hamas should share information about any remaining deceased hostages and \"exert maximum effort to ensure the fulfilment of these commitments as soon as possible\".The agreement signed last week also said Israel would provide information on the remains of Palestinians who died in Israeli custody.Hamas and the International Committee of the Red Cross have said that, because of the widespread destruction in Gaza, recovering the hostages&#x27; bodies is a big challenge.Long journey to recovery for hostages in IsraelThe freed Israeli hostages were in medical care on Tuesday, and some families said it would be weeks before the men could go home.Dalia Cusnir-Horn, whose brother-in-law, Eitan Horn, was released on Monday, said he had lost more than 40 per cent of his body weight after receiving very little food and water in the last few months.\"He has a very, very long way to go,\" she said on Tuesday, saying the physical toll was only part of the trauma.\"He&#x27;s just learning now … friends he knew that were murdered and he had no clue how many people were kidnapped on that day and what this country went through, and it&#x27;s overwhelming and it&#x27;s hard.\"Moshe Levi, whose brother-in-law Omri Miran was freed from Gaza on Monday, spoke about Miran&#x27;s elation at playing with his very young daughters – one less than a year old when her father was taken hostage.\"He could feel like he&#x27;s a father again, and they could feel like they have a father figure in the household. It&#x27;s still surreal for them,\" Levi said.In the West Bank and Gaza, where hundreds of prisoners and detainees were released, several were also taken to hospitals.The Palestine Medical Complex in Ramallah said it received 14 men released on Monday and discharged all but two.Doctors examining the men said their conditions suggested they \"were subjected to severe beatings, reflecting the extent of the violence they endured\", said Imed al-Shami, a resident doctor at the hospital.Kamal Abu Shanab who was released after more than 18 years behind bars said beatings caused his shoulder to tear. \"For eight months, I wasn&#x27;t given even a pill for the pain,\" he said.AP could not independently verify the claims. Israel&#x27;s Prison Service said it was unaware of such claims. \"All inmates are held according to legal procedures, and their rights including access to medical care and adequate living conditions are upheld,\" it said in a statement on Tuesday.Nasser Hospital, in Gaza said Tuesday that the International Committee of the Red Cross transferred the bodies of 45 Palestinians to its morgue. The bodies are the first to arrive of an expected 450.Long-term challenges for lasting peaceDifficult questions remain about what happens next in Gaza, including whether Hamas will disarm and who will govern and help rebuild the territory. Also unanswered is the question of Palestinian statehood, which is a central concern across the region.\"The first steps to peace are always the hardest,\" Trump had said as he stood with foreign leaders in Egypt on Monday for a summit on Gaza&#x27;s future. He hailed the ceasefire deal he brokered between Israel and Hamas as the end of the war in Gaza — and start of rebuilding the devastated territory.Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said 15 Palestinian technocrats have been selected to administer Gaza, with approval from Israel, Hamas and all other Palestinian factions.Palestinians in Gaza appealed for authorities to move quickly to restore some semblance of normality. Mohamad Abu Hajras, a displaced Palestinian from Khan Younis, said he&#x27;s hopeful the ceasefire agreement will swiftly lead to Gaza&#x27;s reconstruction.\"There is no infrastructure, electricity, water, or anything that is fit for life,\" Hajras said.On Tuesday, the UN development agency said the latest joint estimate from the UN, the European Union and the World Bank was that $US70 billion ($108.5 billion) will be required to rebuild Gaza.Jaco Cillers, special representative of UNDP administrator for a program to help Palestinians, said $US20 billion ($31 billion) would be needed in the next three years, and the rest would be needed over a longer period — possibly decades.The war has killed over 67,600 Palestinians, according to Gaza&#x27;s Health Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. It says women and children make up around half the dead, and many independent experts say its figures are the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
