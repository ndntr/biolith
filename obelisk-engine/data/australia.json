His son, the branch&#x27;s assistant state secretary and former rugby league player, accepted two payments which amounted to $10,000 over two-and-a-half months in 2019.READ MORE: Bail as P-plater &#x27;singular error&#x27; allegedly kills pregnant woman, court hearsMichael Greenfield also tried to avoid a penalty for running a red light by signing a false statutory declaration which pinned the blame on an illegal Taiwanese worker.The CMFEU was placed into administration in 2024 after allegations of corruption and links to organised crime.Darren Greenfield was terminated on the same day, several weeks after Michael resigned amid media scrutiny.The elder Greenfield was sentenced to up to 30 months but will be released after 10 months.His son was hit with a maximum sentence of 18 but will be released in six.Both will be required to pay $500 and remain on good behaviour while serving the remainder of their sentence in the community.The person who bribed the elder Greenfield told police he handed over the wads of cash because the CMFEU state secretary \"helped us do things\", the court was previously told.The man, who cannot be named, was in 2022 sentenced to two-and-a-half years&#x27; imprisonment, to be served in the community.
