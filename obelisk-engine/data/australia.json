The declaration, however, is not a ban on protests or marches , with police still aware of demonstrations planned to contest the visit of the controversial president.Police are preparing for the marches, saying that 3500 officers will be deployed across the city for the duration of Herzog&#x27;s three-day visit .\"It&#x27;s a significant policing presence, there&#x27;s no doubt about it,\" NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said.\"This is not business as usual.\"Having a head of state in NSW is something significant .\"The Palestine Action Group has said that up to 5000 people will march from Town Hall to State Parliament to oppose the visit of the Israeli President.READ MORE: Huge weather turnaround to bring storms, floods for every state and territoryThe government has emphasised that the major event declaration is being imposed to prevent the clash of mourners and protesters. \"This is about keeping people safe, lowering the temperature and ensuring Sydney remains calm and orderly,\" Minns said.The Albanese government invited the Israeli president to Australia to mourn with the Jewish community following December&#x27;s terror attack in Bondi.The NSW Police Commissioner announced earlier this week the extension of the Public Assembly Restriction Declaration (PARD) for certain parts of Sydney for the next two weeks.The declaration means public assemblies will be restricted in Sydney&#x27;s eastern suburbs and parts of Sydney&#x27;s CBD, excluding Hyde Park.READ MORE: Trump taking steps toward installing a Christopher Columbus statue near the White HouseForm 1 applications for the approval of public assemblies will also not be accepted in certain areas.Despite Monday&#x27;s planned protest falling within the restricted zone, members of the legislative councils have asked police to have their form 1 application granted. \" We remind you that the United Nations Special Commission of Inquiry has found that Isaac Herzog is guilty of direct and public incitement to commit genocide under article III(c) of the Genocide Convention,\" the statement reads.\"We urge you to grant this request and work with the organisers to ensure that this assembly and march event can go ahead.\" \"We are gravely concerned about the report that you intend to employ some 500 police officers to the protest event and the report of Acting Assistant Commissioner Paul Dunstan threatening to arrest people who wish to march on the planned route.\"The government is also urging people to avoid the city during peak periods on Monday afternoon and evening due to the expected congestion.\"If you don&#x27;t need to be in Sydney CBD on Monday afternoon, unless it&#x27;s absolutely essential, we ask that you not stick around in that area,\" Minns said.\"We know that&#x27;s an inconvenience for some people, but there&#x27;ll be an enormous number of NSW Police.\"NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

          "content": "Tropical Cyclone Mitchell is forecast to intensify to a category 3 storm before it makes landfall in Western Australia &#x27;s Pilbara region, breaking an eight-year record for the nation.Mitchell is sitting off the coast about 140km north of Port Hedland as a category 2 storm and is on track to worsen as it passes north of Karratha overnight.The Bureau of Meteorology is anticipating heavy rainfall and flash flooding later today and has already recorded wind gusts of up to 130km/h.READ MORE: WA Police Commissioner grilled on response to alleged terror bombing at rallyResidents in De Grey to Ningaloo, including Port Hedland, Karratha, Onslow, Exmouth, Pilbara and Pannawonica are under the warning zone.The Department of Fire and Emergency Services has issued a watch and act warning to those in Whim Creek to Mardie, including Barrow Island and Montebello Islands, urging them to prepare to take shelter.\"There is a possible threat to lives and homes as a cyclone is approaching the area,\" the warning reads.An evacuation centre will be open in the Karratha Leisureplex from midday today.Residents south of Mardie to Carnarvon and inland to Pannawonica are urged to prepare now, while those in Pardoo Roadhouse to east of Whim Creek are advised to monitor conditions. Mitchell is expected to continue travelling south to the Pilbara coast at 17km/h tomorrow, where it will remain until it makes landfall there by Monday. \"That&#x27;s pretty fast for a tropical cyclone, and as we&#x27;ll see as we play through the track map for the rest of the day on Saturday, that movement is going to take it quite close to the coastline,\" the bureau&#x27;s Senior Meteorologist Angus Hines said.READ MORE: Author accused of child exploitation returns to courtHeavy rainfall and potential flash flooding are forecast for the area and could extend to the west Gascoyne region.\"Rainfall could cause rivers to rise and burst their banks, and flash flooding could cause areas of flooding anywhere that the rain is heavy, that can lead to road closures and potentially community isolation,\" Hines said. Abnormally high tides are also feared to cause serious flooding in the Karratha region early tomorrow morning and then in the Onslow region by the afternoon.Very destructive winds are expected to extend to Onslow and possibly Exmouth, reaching up to 170km/h, which Hines said could bring down trees and powerlines and damage property.The cyclone is forecast to downgrade to a category 2 storm by Monday night and then a category 1 by Tuesday. But Hines said remnants of the system will continue to be felt across parts of the state.\"This weather system is not going to dissipate quickly as we continue into Monday and next week, we&#x27;ll see the remnants of the system, even though it won&#x27;t be a tropical cyclone anymore, are going to plunge deeply into central parts of Western Australia,\" he said.Mitchell is the ninth tropical cyclone in the 2025-26 season, and if it crosses the coast, it would be the fifth this year.This would be the most cyclones to reach the mainland since five made landfall in eight years, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
