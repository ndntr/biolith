          "content": "US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth summoned hundreds of US military officials to an in-person meeting on Tuesday to declare an end to \"woke\" culture in the military and announce new directives for troops that include \"gender-neutral\" or \"male-level\" standards for physical fitness.Hegseth and US President Donald Trump had abruptly called military leaders from around the world to convene at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, near Washington, without publicly revealing the reason until this morning.Hegseth&#x27;s address largely focused on his own long-used talking points that painted a picture of a military that has been hamstrung by \"woke\" policies and he said military leaders should \"do the honorable thing and resign\" if they don&#x27;t like his new approach.READ MORE: Second detainee dies as result of Dallas ICE facility shooting Meetings between top military brass and civilian leaders are nothing new but the gathering had fuelled intense speculation about the summit&#x27;s purpose given the haste with which it was called and the mystery surrounding it.Admirals and generals from conflict zones in the Middle East and elsewhere were summoned for a lecture on race and gender in the military, underscoring the extent to which the country&#x27;s culture wars have emerged as a front-and-centre agenda item for Hegseth&#x27;s Pentagon, even at a time of broad national security concerns across the globe.During his nearly hour-long speech, Hegseth said the US military has promoted too many leaders for the wrong reasons based on race, gender quotas and \"historic firsts.\"\"The era of politically correct, overly sensitive don&#x27;t-hurt-anyone&#x27;s-feelings leadership ends right now at every level,\" Hegseth said.He said he is loosening disciplinary rules and weakening hazing protections, while his speech had a heavy focus on removing many of the guardrails the military had put in place after numerous scandals and investigations.READ MORE: FBI boss gave NZ officials 3D-printed guns, illegal to possess under local laws Hegseth said he was ordering a review of \"the department&#x27;s definitions of so-called toxic leadership, bullying and hazing to empower leaders to enforce standards without fear of retribution or second guessing.\"He called for \"changes to the retention of adverse information on personnel records that will allow leaders with forgivable, earnest, or minor infractions to not be encumbered by those infractions in perpetuity.\"\"People make honest mistakes, and our mistakes should not define an entire career,\" Hegseth said. \"Otherwise, we only try not to make mistakes.\"Bullying and toxic leadership has had been the suspected and confirmed cause behind numerous military suicides over the past several years including the very dramatic suicide of Brandon Caserta, a young sailor who was bullied into killing himself in 2018.A Navy investigation later found that Caserta&#x27;s supervisor&#x27;s \"noted belligerence, vulgarity and brash leadership was likely a significant contributing factor in (the sailor)&#x27;s decision to end his own life.\"Hegseth used the platform to slam physical fitness and grooming standards, environmental policies and transgender troops while talking up his and Trump&#x27;s focus on \"the warrior ethos\" and \"peace through strength.\"Hegseth said the department has been told from previous administrations that \"our diversity is our strength,\" which he called an \"insane fallacy.\"\"They had to put out dizzying DEI and LGBTQE+ statements. They were told females and males are the same thing, or that males who think they&#x27;re females is totally normal,\" he said, adding the use of electric tanks and the COVID vaccine requirements to the list as mistaken policies.Hegseth said this is is not about preventing women from serving.\"But when it comes to any job that requires physical power to perform in combat, those physical standards must be high and gender neutral,\" he said.\"If women can make it excellent, if not, it is what it is. If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it. That is not the intent, but it could be the result.\"Hegseth also told top military officers that he no longer wants to see \"fat generals and admirals\" or overweight troops in combat formations as he emphasised the need to stick to strict fitness standards for US service members around the world.\"It&#x27;s completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon leading commands around the country, in the world, it&#x27;s a bad look,\" Hegseth said.\"It is bad, and it&#x27;s not who we are.\"Hegseth&#x27;s speech came as the country faces a potential government shutdown this week and as Hegseth, who has hammered home a focus on lethality and what he calls the \"warrior ethos,\" has taken several unusual and unexplained actions, including ordering cuts to the number of general officers and firings of other top military leaders.News about the abruptly scheduled meeting broke on Thursday, and top Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell confirmed it but declined to release further details.Trump didn&#x27;t seem to know about it when he was asked by reporters during an Oval Office appearance later that day. The Republican president said he&#x27;ll \"be there if they want me, but why is that such a big deal?\"A White House official said Sunday that Trump also will speak at the gathering. The president told NBC News that he and Hegseth would be \"talking about how well we&#x27;re doing militarily, talking about being in great shape, talking about a lot of good, positive things.\"Vice President JD Vance argued last week that the media had turned it into a \"big story\" and that it was \"not particularly unusual that generals who report to\" Hegseth are coming to speak with him.Italian Adm. Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, the chair of NATO&#x27;s Military Committee, described the meeting as unusual and told reporters Saturday after a NATO meeting in Riga, Latvia, that \"as far as my 49 years of service, I&#x27;ve never seen that before.\"The lack of detailed information has prompted many observers in Washington to speculate about the meeting&#x27;s focus. Whatever it is, Michael O&#x27;Hanlon, of the Brookings Institution, said he suspects there will be a dramatic element that may be \"as important as any substantive element.\"\"Just the sheer scale makes you wonder what kind of meaningful interaction can occur,\" said O&#x27;Hanlon, Brookings&#x27; director of research for foreign policy.\"And therefore it smacks more of theatrics or of trying to impose than of trying to exchange views.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "On a visit to New Zealand, FBI Director Kash Patel gave the country&#x27;s police and spy bosses gifts of inoperable pistols that were illegal to possess under local gun laws and had to be destroyed, New Zealand law enforcement agencies told The Associated Press.The plastic 3D-printed replica pistols formed part of display stands Patel presented to at least three senior New Zealand security officials in July. Patel, the most senior Trump administration official to visit the country so far, was in Wellington to open the FBI&#x27;s first standalone office in New Zealand.READ MORE: Rescuers run oxygen to survivors in Indonesia school building collapse Pistols are tightly restricted weapons under New Zealand law and possessing one requires an additional permit beyond a regular gun licence. Law enforcement agencies didn&#x27;t specify whether the officials who met with Patel held such permits, but they couldn&#x27;t have legally kept the gifts if they didn&#x27;t.It wasn&#x27;t clear what permissions Patel had sought to bring the weapons into the country. A spokesperson for Patel told the AP Tuesday that the FBI would not comment.The pistols were surrendered and destroyedInoperable weapons are treated as though they&#x27;re operable in New Zealand if modifications could make them workable again. The pistols were judged by gun regulators to be potentially operable and were destroyed, New Zealand&#x27;s Police Commissioner Richard Chambers told AP in a statement on Tuesday.Chambers didn&#x27;t specify how the weapons had been rendered inoperable before Patel gifted them. Usually this means the temporary disabling of the gun&#x27;s firing mechanism.Three of New Zealand&#x27;s most powerful law enforcement figures said they received the gifts at meetings July 31. Chambers was one recipient, and the other two were Andrew Hampton, Director-General of the country&#x27;s human intelligence agency NZSIS, and Andrew Clark, Director-General of the technical intelligence agency GCSB, according to a joint statement from their departments.A spokesperson for the spy agencies described the gift as \"a challenge coin display stand\" that included the 3D-printed inoperable weapon \"as part of the design.\" The officials sought advice on the gifts the next day from the regulator that enforces New Zealand&#x27;s gun laws, Chambers said.When the weapons were examined, it was discovered they were potentially operable.\"To ensure compliance with firearms laws, I instructed Police to retain and destroy them,\" Chambers said.James Davidson, a former FBI agent who is now president of the FBI Integrity Project, a nonprofit that seeks to safeguard the bureau from undue partisan influence, has criticised Patel&#x27;s appointment.But Davidson said the gift of the replica pistols appeared \"a genuine gesture\" from Patel and their destruction was \"quite frankly, an overreaction by the NZSIS, which could have simply rendered the replica inoperable,\" he said.New Zealand has strong gun controls3D-printed weapons are treated the same as other guns in New Zealand. The country bolstered its gun restrictions following a 2019 white supremacist attack on two mosques in the city of Christchurch, when 51 Muslim worshipers were shot dead by an Australian man who had amassed a cache of semiautomatic weapons legally.The guns Patel gifted to the law enforcement chiefs were not semiautomatic models now prohibited after the Christchurch massacre. But there are a suite of other reasons New Zealanders might not legally be able to possess certain weapons, including the specific permits required for pistols.New Zealand doesn&#x27;t have a passionate culture of gun ownership and the weapons have been viewed more dimly since the mass shooting. Gun ownership is enshrined in New Zealand law as a privilege, not a right.The country isn&#x27;t short on guns; they&#x27;re common in rural areas for pest control. But violent gun crime is rare and many urban residents might never have even seen a firearm in person.It&#x27;s uncommon even to see police officers carrying weapons. Front-line officers aren&#x27;t usually armed on patrol and leave their weapons locked in their vehicles.Patel caused discomfort with China remarksNews of Patel&#x27;s visit caused ripples in New Zealand at the time because the opening of the new FBI field office in Wellington wasn&#x27;t divulged to news outlets or the public until it had already happened. An FBI statement in July said the move aligned New Zealand with FBI missions in other Five Eyes intelligence-sharing nations, which also include the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.The office would provide a local mission for FBI staff who have operated with oversight from Canberra, Australia, since 2017, the statement said.Public records disclosed to local news outlets this month revealed that Patel met with and dined with a more than a dozen senior public servants and elected officials, including Cabinet ministers, during his visit. It wasn&#x27;t immediately clear on Tuesday how many officials received the pistols as gifts.Patel had already provoked mild diplomatic discomfort in Wellington by suggesting in remarks supplied to reporters that the new FBI office aimed to counter China&#x27;s influence in the South Pacific Ocean, where New Zealand is located. The comments prompted polite dismissal from officials in Wellington, who said the bolstered FBI presence was primarily to collaborate on child exploitation and drug smuggling crimes. Beijing decried Patel&#x27;s remarks.",
