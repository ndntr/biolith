          "content": "Baby boy Charlie Jones has made history as Queensland&#x27;s smallest-ever newborn after he arrived early, weighing less than a can of Coke.Charlie was born at Brisbane Mater Hospital on October 8 at just 26 weeks, and tipped the scales at just 360 grams.His minuscule weight is barely one-tenth of the average baby boy and is believed to be the state&#x27;s tiniest newborn – breaking the record of the famous \"Coke can kid\", Jonathon Heeley, who weighed 400 grams when he was born in 1992.

The doctors had said they were concerned about whether Charlie would be too small for the equipment needed to keep him alive.\"Charlie was delivered via c-section and doctors initially estimated he would weigh around 400 grams.But his first weigh-in revealed the tiny tot has likely broken a record.He is only slightly heavier than Australia&#x27;s smallest newborn Elora De Bondi, who was just 319 grams when she was born in 2007. \"We have had babies born at similar or smaller sizes to Charlie before, but tragically they have not survived,\" Mater&#x27;s Director of Neonatology Dr Pita Birch said.\"Charlie&#x27;s story is the result of many advances in the way we care for very small babies and their mothers – thanks to research, enhanced technology and learning from other units around the world.\"But it&#x27;s also down to Charlie too. He&#x27;s a tough little guy.\"Two months on, Charlie is now a healthier 1.4 kilograms.Sarah and her husband Nick will spend Christmas with their son in hospital.Charlie is expected to remain in a critical care neonatal unit until at least January.
