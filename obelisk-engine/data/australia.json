Albanese wore a suit by MJ Bale, and his much-loved dog Toto was the ring bearer.The couple left the ceremony to Stevie Wonder&#x27;s Sign, Sealed, Delivered. &#x27;I couldn&#x27;t imagine life without her&#x27; Albanese and Haydon met in 2019 at a business dinner and bonded over their love of the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Haydon, who grew up on the NSW Central Coast, accompanied the prime minister throughout his 2022 and 2025 election campaigns.Albanese proposed to Haydon on Valentine&#x27;s Day last year, making him the first Australian prime minister to get engaged while in office.The pair kept plans for their nuptials tightly under wraps, largely for security reasons due to rising concerns around political violence across Australia.In August, the PM revealed the ceremony would be a small affair, with no international figures on the guest list.\"It&#x27;s not a political event. It&#x27;s an event between myself and Jodie,\" Albanese told Brisbane radio station B105.Albanese has spoken in the past about the moment he decided Haydon was the woman he wanted to marry.\"This,\" he told the reporter while gesturing towards The Lodge, \"will end one day, and the thing about our relationship is that we enjoy spending time together. Just us. So, when it became clear to me that Jodie was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, and that I couldn&#x27;t imagine a life without her, I made the decision.\"Before popping the question on Valentine&#x27;s Day last year, Albanese said he first spoke to Nathan, his son.\"I respect him and have a good relationship with him, and with his mother. So I asked him to think about it, and then he came back to me and Nathan was supportive. He wants me to be happy, and Nathan and Jodie have a really nice relationship as well.\"More to come.",
