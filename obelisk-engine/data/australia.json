          "content": "Warning: This story contains graphic content. An alleged \"kill crew\" charged with the kidnap and murder of an organised crime network member&#x27;s wife in Sydney sent a picture of the woman to her husband before killing her, police claim.Thi Kim Tran, 45, was at her home in Bankstown about 10.30pm on April 17 when a group of men allegedly forced their way in and kidnapped her at gunpoint.They allegedly assaulted an eight-year-old boy with a baseball bat, putting him in a coma, before forcing the woman to strip naked on the street and forcing her into an SUV.READ MORE: &#x27;Mind boggling&#x27;: NBA coach and player charged over massive betting schemesA 15-year-old boy at the home was also taken to hospital for assessment.About an hour later, a car was found burning on Welfare Avenue in nearby Beverly Hills.Fire crews extinguished the blaze, but the car was destroyed and police found Tran dead inside.She had been bound and gagged, but had died before the car was set alight, Detective Superintendent Joe Doueihi told media today. READ MORE: Tragic discovery in search for missing mumPolice allege the woman was likely targeted due to her husband&#x27;s involvement with a Victoria-based organised criminal network.Strike Force Bushfield detectives yesterday arrested three men, aged 31, 20 and 21, allegedly part of a \"kill crew\" tasked with finding and killing Tran&#x27;s husband.They were charged with murder, conspiring to murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, kidnapping in company and participating in a criminal group.Doueihi said the matter would be heard in court today.Families no longer &#x27;off limits&#x27; Doueihi said the husband was in hiding after his superiors in the crime syndicate suspected he had stolen up to 80kg of drugs from their operation.Attempts to lure him out failed, Doueihi said, and so they had visited his home after attempting to contact him.However, Doueihi said police will allege Tran would have been targeted regardless.\"It obviously appears those days are gone,\" he said when asked by media about whether old underworld prohibitions against targeting uninvolved family remembers had been discarded.\"These young criminals are ruthless, they don&#x27;t care about the &#x27;code&#x27;, if I can use that word.\"It&#x27;s no longer &#x27;families are off limits&#x27;, it&#x27;s whatever&#x27;s in their best interest. \"He claimed the alleged killers also sent Tran&#x27;s husband a photo of her before her death.Tran was unaware of any supposed criminal activity her husband had been involved in, Doueihi said, and police were now in contact with the husband, who was cooperating with the investigation. READ MORE: With this handshake, King makes history in a 500-year first&#x27;Guns for hire&#x27;Doueihi said the kill order had come from much higher up in the crime syndicate, but it was uncertain whether it originated in Victoria or overseas.He characterised the three men arrested yesterday as \"guns for hire\" who were \"extremely well known\" to police and organised crime groups alike. And the investigation is still ongoing.\"There may have been other people at the house, but we&#x27;re not quite certain,\" Doueihi said.The Anh Nguyen, 29, was charged in August with facilitating the alleged kidnapping and murder.Nguyen is not alleged to have killed Tran himself, but to have brought the three men who allegedly did to her home and facilitated it.The eight-year-old injured with the bat had made a \"remarkable\" phsyical recovery, Doueihi said, after it was initially feared he would be left with life-long injuries.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

The defendants include former professional athletes accused of using technology to steal millions of dollars from victims in underground poker games in the New York area that were backed by Mafia families, he said.Athletes accused of leaving games earlyIn the sports betting scheme, players sometimes altered their performance or took themselves out of games early, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.In one instance, Rozier, while playing for the Hornets, told others he was planning to leave the game early with a \"supposed injury\", allowing others to place wagers that raked in thousands of dollars, Tisch said.The indictment of Rozier and others says there are nine unnamed co-conspirators including a Florida resident who was an NBA player and an Oregon resident who was an NBA player from about 1997 to 2014 and an NBA coach since at least 2021, as well as a relative of Rozier.Rozier and other defendants \"had access to private information known by NBA players or NBA coaches\" that was likely to affect the outcome of games or players&#x27; performances and provided that information to other co-conspirators in exchange for either a flat fee or a share of betting profits, the indictment says.READ MORE: Tragic discovery in search for missing mumThe NBA had investigatedThe NBA, which had investigated Rozier previously, had no immediate comment.Rozier was in uniform as the Heat played the Magic in Orlando, Florida, in the season opener for both teams on Wednesday evening, though he did not play in the game.He was taken into custody in Orlando early Thursday morning. The team didn&#x27;t immediately comment on the arrest.A message was left with Rozier&#x27;s lawyer, Jim Trusty, on Thursday. Trusty previously told ESPN that Rozier was told that an initial investigation determined he did nothing wrong after he met with NBA and FBI officials in 2023, the sports network reported.A message seeking comment was left with Billups on Thursday morning.READ MORE: Iconic Aussie food company collapses owing millionsThe case was brought by the US attorney&#x27;s office in Brooklyn that previously prosecuted ex-NBA player Jontay Porter. The former Toronto Raptors centre pleaded guilty to charges that he withdrew early from games, claiming illness or injury, so that those in the know could win big by betting on him to underperform expectations.Billups was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame last year. The five-time All-Star and three-time All-NBA point guard led the Detroit Pistons to their third league title in 2004 as NBA Finals MVP.Boston drafted the former Colorado star with the No.3 pick overall in 1997. The player known as Mr Big Shot also played for Toronto, Denver, Minnesota, the New York Knicks and the Los Angeles Clippers.Billups won the Joe Dumars Trophy, the NBA&#x27;s sportsmanship award, in 2009 while playing for his hometown Denver Nuggets.The 49-year-old is in his fifth season as Portland&#x27;s coach, compiling a 117-212 record. The Trail Blazers opened the season on Wednesday night at home with a 118-114 loss to Minnesota.A game involving Rozier that has been in question was played on March 23, 2023, a matchup between the Hornets and the New Orleans Pelicans.Rozier played the first nine minutes and 36 seconds of that game — and not only did not return that night, citing a foot issue, but did not play again that season.Charlotte had eight games remaining and was not in playoff contention, so it did not seem particularly unusual that Rozier was shut down for the season&#x27;s final games.In that March 23 game, Rozier finished with five points, four rebounds and two assists in that opening period — a productive quarter but well below his usual total output for a full game.Posts still online from March 23, 2023, show that some bettors were furious with sportsbooks that evening when it became evident that Rozier was not going to return to the Charlotte-New Orleans game after the first quarter, with many turning to social media to say that something \"shady\" had gone on regarding the prop bets involving his stats for that night.A prop is a type of wager that allows gamblers to bet on whether a player will exceed a certain statistical number, such as whether the player will finish over or under a certain total of points, rebounds, assists and more.There are many different ways to get help and information about gambling.
