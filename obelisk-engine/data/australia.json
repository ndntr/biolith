          "content": "L egendary actress Diane Keaton has died at the age of 79.There are no further details at this time and her family has requested privacy, a spokesperson told People magazine, which first reported the news.Keaton was the kind of actor who helped make films iconic and timeless, from her \"La-dee-da, la-dee-da\" phrasing as Annie Hall, bedecked in that necktie, bowler hat, vest and khakis, to her heartbreaking turn as Kay Adams, the woman unfortunate enough to join the Corleone family in The Godfather.READ MORE: &#x27;Fun-loving&#x27; couple among three dead in light plane crashHer star-making performances in the 1970s, many of which were in Woody Allen films, were not a flash in the pan either, and she would continue to charm new generations for decades thanks in part to a longstanding collaboration with filmmaker Nancy Meyers.Keaton won her first Oscar for Annie Hall and would go on to be nominated three more times, for Reds, Marvin&#x27;s Room and Something&#x27;s Gotta Give.In her very Keaton way, upon accepting her Oscar in 1978 she laughed and said, \"This is something.\"READ MORE: Whistleblower claims alarming safety fails at embattled childcare chainBette Midler, who starred with Keaton in The First Wives Club, paid tribute in a post on Instagram: \" The brilliant, beautiful, extraordinary Diane Keaton has died. I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me.\"She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. What you saw was who she was…oh, la, lala!\"Octavia Spencer remembered Keaton as \"[not] just an actress: she was a force. a woman who showed us that being yourself is the most powerful thing you can be\".\" From Annie Hall to Something&#x27;s Gotta Give, she made every role unforgettable. But beyond the screen, she brought joy, laughter, and style that was all her own. Thank you, Diane, for reminding us that authenticity never goes out of fashion,\" Spencer&#x27;s tribute read.Keaton was born Diane Hall in January 1946 in Los Angeles, though her family was not part of the film industry she would find herself in.Her mother was a homemaker and photographer, and her father was in real estate and civil engineering.Keaton made her film debut in the 1970 romantic comedy Lovers and Other Strangers, but her big breakthrough would come a few years later when she was cast in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s The Godfather, which won best picture and become one of the most beloved films of all time.And yet even she hesitated to return for the sequel, though after reading the script she decided otherwise.READ MORE: Major changes to how Aussies travel in EuropeThe 1970s were an incredibly fruitful time for Keaton thanks in part to her ongoing collaboration with Allen in both comedic and dramatic roles.She appeared in Sleeper, Love and Death, Interiors, Manhattan, Manhattan Murder Mystery and the film version of Play it Again, Sam.Allen and the late Marshall Brickman gave Keaton one of her most iconic roles in Annie Hall, the infectious woman from Chippewa Falls whom Allen&#x27;s Alvy Singer cannot get over.The film is considered one of the great romantic comedies of all time, with Keaton&#x27;s eccentric, self-deprecating Annie at its heart.- Reported with Associated Press DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

READ MORE: Whistleblower claims alarming safety fails at embattled childcare chainOf the 20 wounded, four were in critical condition and flown from a hospital in nearby Greenville to a larger medical centre in the state capital city of Jackson, Simmons told The Associated Press.Simmons said he was being updated on developments by the Washington County Sheriff’s Office as well as from other law enforcement authorities in the Delta.“People were just congregating and having a good time in the downtown of Leland,” Simmons said of the town with a population of fewer than 4000 people.He was told that after the gunfire, the scene was “very chaotic,” as police, sheriff’s deputies and ambulances “responded from all over”.“It’s just senseless gun violence,” he said. “What we are experiencing now is just a proliferation of guns just being in circulation.”No arrests have been announced, and Simmons said that he had not heard any information about possible suspects.“They are on the ground working and I have all the faith in the world that they will get to the bottom of this,” he said.“As the state senator for the area, we are asking any and all individuals who might have any information regarding the horrific shooting last night to come forward and provide whatever information they have,” he added.Separate shooting in eastern Mississippi killed twoMeanwhile, police in the small Mississippi town of Heidelberg in the eastern part of the state are investigating a shooting during that community&#x27;s homecoming weekend that left two people dead.Both of them were killed on the school campus on Friday night, Heidelberg Police Chief Cornell White said. He declined to say whether the victims were students or provide other information about the crimes.“Right now we’ve still got a subject at large, but I can’t give specifics,” White said.READ MORE: Car fire investigated as underworld attack gone wrongAn 18-year-old man was being sought for questioning in the Heidelberg shooting, the Jasper County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. The sheriff asked that anyone with information contact the police chief or sheriff’s office.The shooting in Heidelberg happened on the school campus where the Heidelberg Oilers were playing their homecoming football game Friday night. The town of about 640 residents is about 137 kilometres south-east of the state capital of Jackson.It wasn’t clear exactly when the gunfire occurred or how close it was to the stadium. White said he was at the scene investigating, and that more information might be released in the coming days.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
