It is suspected that the patients ingested the poison via contaminated products served at a fast food outlet in Logan. McDougall told 9News the department is working to determine the source of the poisoning.Rat poison reduces vitamin K in the body, which decreases a person&#x27;s ability to clot blood and can be very serious in some cases.All five patients who turned up sick at hospitals are receiving treatment and are expected to be okay.
