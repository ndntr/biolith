          "content": "NSW&#x27;s public assembly restriction has been extended due to safety concerns following the terror attack at Bondi Beach last month.After the state rushed through new laws, Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon was given the power to temporarily restrict protests from public areas on December 24.He has reviewed the 14-day declaration and has extended it again until January 20 due to heightened fear within the community.READ MORE: Aboriginal mother of five named after dying in outback prison cell\"I have decided that the holding of public assemblies for the next 14 days has the potential to cause fear and public safety issues,\" he said.\"This is not about stopping free speech. It&#x27;s about making sure that the community has time to feel safe.\" During the initial 14 days, there was a protest held for Venezuela on Sunday following US President Donald Trump&#x27;s capture of Nicolas Maduro.A protester who wore a jacket with the phrase \"globalise the intifada\" was arrested and later released without charge.The renewed declaration means police will not accept any form 1 applications for protests in the South West Metropolitan, North West Metropolitan and Central Metropolitan policing areas.While gatherings are still allowed, anyone who causes obstructions to roads, businesses or others, behaves in an intimidating or harassing manner or causes fear in others can be ordered to move on.Anyone who fails to do so can be charged with an offence. Police also have the power to require anyone suspected of committing an offence to remove any face coverings. The declaration is in place for 14 days at a time.The NSW Police Commissioner has the power to extend the declaration for up to three months. READ MORE: Police declare &#x27;major crime&#x27; after suspicious disappearance of motherA coalition of protest groups has planned to hold a \" Genocide is a crime, Protest is Not\" rally amid the latest declaration in Sydney on January 16.Lanyon said he would assess the behaviour at any unauthorised protests and the community sentiment when the 14 days are up to determine whether to extend the declaration after January 20. \"We will consider all of those factors. It is very premature to talk about what may happen post these 14 days,\" he said.\"I&#x27;m constantly looking at the community and working very closely with the community to understand the fear and the level of comfort within the community.\"My job is to ensure public safety.\"Police Minister Yasmin Catley said police had the full support of the government.\"The NSW government unequivocally supports the commissioner&#x27;s decision and remains committed to ensuring NSW Police have the powers, resources and backing they need to keep the community safe.\" The new powers have been criticised by demonstrators and civil rights groups, who argue the rules impede the democratic right to protest. The Stop the War on Palestine group has condemned Lanyon&#x27;s decision today to extend the declaration.\"It is blatantly obvious that the ban has nothing to do with &#x27;social cohesion&#x27; and everything to do with removing democratic rights to oppose government policy and genocide,\" the group said in a statement.
