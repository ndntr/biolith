          "content": "\"In retrospect,\" Kamala Harris writes of letting Joe and Jill Biden decide on their own whether the then-president should have tried to run for re-election, \"I think it was recklessness.\"That is the assessment that the former vice president makes in her forthcoming memoir of her abbreviated 2024 run, in a significant break from the dutiful stance she took toward her old boss throughout their time in office and since.\"&#x27;It&#x27;s Joe and Jill&#x27;s decision.&#x27; We all said that, like a mantra, as if we&#x27;d all been hypnotised,\" Harris writes in the first excerpt of \"107 Days\" published on Wednesday morning by The Atlantic. LIVE UPDATES: Trump ally shot from a &#x27;long distance&#x27;\"The stakes were simply too high. This wasn&#x27;t a choice that should have been left to an individual&#x27;s ego, an individual&#x27;s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.\"Part of the problem, Harris writes, was a Biden team so committed to not helping her that she says it ultimately came at his own, and the country&#x27;s expense.\"When polls indicated that I was getting more popular, the people around him didn&#x27;t like the contrast that was emerging,\" Harris writes. \"None of them grasped that if I did well, he did well. That given the concerns about his age, my visible success as his vice president was vital. It would serve as a testament to his judgment in choosing me and reassurance that if something happened, the country was in good hands. My success was important for him.\"\"His team,\" Harris ends the chapter by writing, \"didn&#x27;t get it.\"Harris notes in the chapter that she is a loyal person. That loyalty to the point of timidity about taking on Biden and his record became an anchor to her presidential campaign, most devastatingly during an appearance on The View last October when she was asked, \"What, if anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?\"Despite preparation and prodding from top aides to make a break, she said, \"There is not a thing that comes to mind.\"READ MORE: Pro-Trump personality Charlie Kirk dead after shooting on US college campusThat comment haunted her through the final weeks of coverage and advertising by Donald Trump&#x27;s campaign as she went on to her narrow loss.She also tackles what was one of the trickiest topics facing her as she set out to put this memoir together: how Biden&#x27;s age took a public and private toll.Harris disputes that there was any serious problem.\"On his worst day, he was more deeply knowledgeable, more capable of exercising judgement, and far more compassionate than Donald Trump on his best. But at 81, Joe got tired,\" Harris writes.\"That&#x27;s when his age showed in physical and verbal stumbles. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any surprise that the debate debacle happened right after two back-to-back trips to Europe and a flight to the West Coast for a Hollywood fundraiser. I don&#x27;t believe it was incapacity. If I believed that, I would have said so. As loyal as I am to President Biden, I am more loyal to my country.\"Harris announced over the summer she would not, as many expected, run for governor of California next year but has left the door open to another presidential run, though multiple people close to her have told CNN they expect her time running for office may be done.In the meantime, her book, set to be released in two weeks, is another development in an interconnected but sometimes troubled relationship between her and Biden, which stretches back to her friendship with Biden&#x27;s beloved late son Beau through the moment in the first primary debate in June 2019 when she attacked Biden as wrong for his 1970s position on school busing and then through the ups and downs of serving together in the White House.Harris writes about being undercut by Biden and his staff, accusing them of neither defending nor highlighting her and even \"adding fuel to negative narratives that sprang up around me.\"Her assignment from Biden to be the point person for migration issues stemming from Central America, Harris writes, was a perfect example.\"When Republicans mischaracterised my role as &#x27;border czar,&#x27; no one in the White House comms team helped me to effectively push back and explain what I had really been tasked to do, nor to highlight any of the progress I had achieved,\" adding several paragraphs later, \"Instead, I shouldered the blame for the porous border, an issue that had proved intractable for Democratic and Republican administrations alike.\"A spokesperson for Biden did not have an immediate comment and several longtime aides did not respond to CNN&#x27;s requests for comment.Sen. Chris Coons, a longtime Biden confidant representing his home state of Delaware, told \"CNN News Central\" that he understood Harris second-guessing Biden&#x27;s decision. Pushed on whether Democrats needed to discuss the Biden campaign in greater detail, Coons said the party should instead focus on Trump&#x27;s presidency.\"The interest in relitigating a decision made by a former president a year and a half ago is pretty limited in the folks I&#x27;m talking to,\" Coons said.Asked for his response to the book, Andrew Bates, who served as a spokesperson for the Biden White House, pointed to Democratic successes in special elections since Trump returned to office.\"We&#x27;re making an effective case against Trump&#x27;s cost-raising agenda and chaos,\" Bates told CNN. \"And I&#x27;m proud to have worked for an administration led by two people who are not in the Epstein files.\"The chapter in the excerpt is written about July 24, 2024, a few days after Harris took over as the nominee following nearly a month of Democratic trauma and when Biden finally delivered an Oval Office address to discuss his exit.Even that came with a sour note, Harris writes.\"It was almost nine minutes into the 11-minute address,\" she recalls, \"before he mentioned me.\"READ MORE: Who was Charlie Kirk?

          "content": "NASA’s Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, scientists reported on Wednesday.They stressed that in-depth analysis is needed of the sample gathered there by Perseverance — ideally in labs on Earth — before reaching any conclusions.Roaming Mars since 2021, the rover cannot directly detect life.READ MORE: Eight dead in tourist hotspot Bali as floods hit Indonesia Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for hosting life billions of years ago.The samples are awaiting retrieval to Earth — an ambitious plan that&#x27;s on hold as NASA seeks cheaper, quicker options.Calling it an “exciting discovery,” a pair of scientists who were not involved in the study — SETI Institute’s Janice Bishop and the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Mario Parente — were quick to point out that non-biological processes could be responsible.“That’s part of the reason why we can’t go so far as to say, ‘A-ha, this is proof positive of life,&#x27;’’ lead researcher Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University told The Associated Press.“All we can say is one of the possible explanations is microbial life, but there could be other ways to make this set of features that we see.”Either way, Hurowitz said it’s the best, most compelling candidate yet in the rover’s search for potential signs of long-ago life.It was the 25th sample gathered; the tally is now up to 30, with six more to go.READ MORE: Poland &#x27;facing enemy&#x27; as it shoots down Russian drones in its airspace “It would be amazing to be able to demonstrate conclusively that these features were formed by something that was alive on another planet billions of years ago, right?\" Hurowitz said.But even if that&#x27;s not the case, it&#x27;s \"a valuable lesson in all of the ways that nature can conspire to fool us.”Collected last summer, the sample is from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, a river channel that once carried water into Jezero Crater.This outcrop of sedimentary rock, known as the Bright Angel formation, was surveyed by Perseverance’s science instruments before the drill came out.Along with organic carbon, a building block of life, Hurowitz and his team found minuscule specks, dubbed poppy seeds and leopard spots, that were enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide.On Earth, these chemical compounds are the byproducts when microorganisms chomp down on organic matter.The findings appeared in the journal Nature. Ten of the titanium sample tubes were placed on the Martian surface a few years ago as a backup to the rest aboard the rover, the main target in NASA’s still fuzzy return mission.When Perseverance launched in 2020, NASA expected the samples back on Earth by the early 2030s.But that date slipped into the 2040s as costs swelled to $US11 billion ($16 billion) stalling the retrieval effort.READ MORE: Urgent warning to young Aussies heading on schoolies overseas Until the samples are transported off of Mars by robotic spacecraft or astronauts, scientists will have to rely on Earthly stand-ins and lab experiments to evaluate the feasibility of ancient Martian life, according to Hurowitz.On Earth, microorganisms commonly interact with minerals in Antarctic lakes.“There is no evidence of microbes on Mars today, but if any had been present on ancient Mars, they too might have reduced sulfate minerals to form sulfides in such a lake at Jezero Crater,” Bishop and Parente wrote in an accompanying editorial.",
