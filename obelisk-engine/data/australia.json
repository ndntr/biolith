She must have been knocking for quite some time.\"According to Pairat, the brother said his sister had been bedridden for about two years, when her health deteriorated and she became unresponsive, appearing to stop breathing two days ago. The brother then placed her in a coffin and made the 500-kilometre journey to a hospital in Bangkok, to which the woman had previously expressed a wish to donate her organs.The hospital refused to accept the brother&#x27;s offer as he didn&#x27;t have an official death certificate, Pairat said. His temple offers a free cremation service, which is why the brother approached them on Sunday, but was also refused due to the missing document.The temple manager said that while he was explaining how to get a death certificate when they heard the knocking. They then assessed her and sent her to a nearby hospital.The abbot said the temple would cover her medical expenses, according to Pairat.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Panicking relatives and explosion risks confronted police after two joy flight helicopters collided mid-air outside a theme park, a coroner has heard.Four people died when the two Sea World choppers collided above the Gold Coast Broadwater and crashed on a sandbar in January 2023 during the busy summer holiday season.Almost three years later, coroner Carol Lee today opened an inquest in Brisbane into 11 critical issues surrounding one of Australia&#x27;s worst air disasters.READ MORE: Sales are luring almost half of Aussies into spending too muchGold Coast Water Police supervisor Justin Dunn arrived on scene within minutes.\"It was absolute chaos, it really was,\" acting Senior Sergeant Dunn said.Members of the public performed CPR on a woman and gave first aid to an injured young boy, Lee heard.As he approached an overturned aircraft, Dunn was given a chilling warning by a concerned bystander.\"I felt a hand on my shoulder. He said be careful of pressurised fuel lines. As they could explode,\" Dunn said.\"It was a mangled wreck.\"READ MORE: Federal government will move to ban &#x27;subscription traps&#x27;, drip pricing Dunn found people dead in an upside down helicopter before discovering passenger Winnie De Silva trapped under the rear of the aircraft.\"I introduced myself and said help was on the way. I asked for a towel to wipe the fuel from her face,\" he said.Shocking footage of the moment the two choppers collided and began to freefall was shown to the inquest as part of counsel assisting Ian Harvey&#x27;s opening address.Multiple passengers used their phones to film one of the helicopters taking off, followed five minutes later by their own chopper&#x27;s flight on a bright sunny day above turquoise water.Just 25 seconds after the second helicopter took off, it collided with a fellow Sea World-branded chopper at an altitude just under 40 metres.READ MORE: Police to carry out fresh searches for missing boy Gus Lamont at old mineshafts At least one passenger in the second helicopter is shown on video trying to get a pilot&#x27;s attention and point out the other aircraft is closing in on them.\"It&#x27;s inescapable that neither pilot saw the other pilot&#x27;s helicopter,\" Harvey said.\"How could that happen? They were two experienced pilots in modern, relatively sophisticated helicopters.\"Security camera footage showed the helicopter piloted by Ashley Jenkinson crash onto a sandbar near Sea World and roll onto its roof.Jenkinson, 40, died as well as British newlyweds Ronald and Diane Hughes - aged 65 and 67 - and Sydney mother Vanessa Tadros, 36.Tadros&#x27; husband Simon was at the inquest today.CCTV on a nearby helipad also captured the helicopter piloted by Michael James coming to a controlled landing near the first chopper&#x27;s crash site.James and nine passengers across both aircraft were injured, most of them seriously.Last year James died from an unrelated medical condition, Harvey said.Senior Sergeant Duane Killic was off duty and attending Sea World for leisure when he saw the crash.\"I observed them for five to 10 seconds. It was getting closer and I thought it must be an optical illusion as they can&#x27;t be that close,\" he told the inquest.Killic rushed to grab the manifest from the helipad to aid in the rescue effort.He ran into Tadros who was in a state of \"panic\" over his family members being on one of the helicopters.The response to the crash from emergency services, Sea World staff and civilians was \"extraordinary\", lead police investigator Detective Sergeant Dane Sheraton testified.\"I think more lives would have been lost without the response of those people,\" he said.The inquest comes months after a damning safety bureau report on the crash.A litany of factors led to the crash including limited visibility, failed radio transmissions and a lack of safety protocols, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau&#x27;s final report revealed in April.Harvey said at the time of the crash the volume of flights had been doubled for the peak holiday season.\"It was one of the busiest air corridors in the country,\" he said.The inquest is due to run for three weeks.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Hanson&#x27;s stunt was slammed by Australia&#x27;s Islamophobia envoy Aftab Malik, who told the Sydney Morning Herald the move could worsen harassment, threats of rape and violence against Muslim women in Australia.\"It is frustrating to see Australian Muslim women&#x27;s choice of clothing continually tied to national security concerns,\" Malik said.\"Islamophobia is at record levels in Australia, described as &#x27;unprecedented&#x27; by the Islamophobia Register Australia. Muslim women, in particular, face the brunt.\"Senator Pauline Hanson, eight years after her last call to ban the burqa, is again proposing it.\"This will deepen existing safety risks for Australian Muslim women who choose to wear the headscarf, the hijab, or the full face and body covering, the burqa.\"READ MORE: Tectonic shift in Aussie drinking habits revealedGreens Senator Mehreen Faruqi told the newspaper One Nation \"has nothing to offer Australians apart from tired culture wars and hollow publicity stunts\".\"Nearly 10 years on from Hanson&#x27;s pathetic burqa stunt in the Senate, One Nation has flipped through its racist, Islamophobic policy generator and landed on the burqa ban once more,\" Faruqi said.\"The idea that the government should be regulating what a woman can and cannot wear should never be up for debate. Parliament should outright reject this.\"Independent WA senator Fatima Payman said Hanson was \"disrespecting a faith, disrespecting Muslim Australians\".\"This needs to be dealt with immediately before we proceed, it&#x27;s disgraceful,\" Payman said in the Senate.Wong said Hanson&#x27;s conduct was \"not worthy\" of the parliament and senators should not be \"disrespectful of the Senate\".Ruston called for respect for others and said, \"This is not the way you should be addressing this chamber.\"Greens leader Larissa Waters called the burqa stunt an \"insult\".READ MORE: Bureau of Meteorology asked to explain why new website cost $92m more than reportedNationals Senator Matt Canavan said Hanson&#x27;s stunt \"weakens her case\", \"cheapens our parliament\" and would prompt most Australians to \"look away in disgust\".\"Pauline Hanson needs some new material because, as you said, she has recycled this from eight years ago,\" Canavan told the ABC.\"While this might attract the interest of a small fringe in our society, I just don&#x27;t think middle Australia like to see our parliament debased like this.\"I think this is disrespectful to Muslim Australians as well, I don&#x27;t support you ridiculing people who have certain multicultural dress standards, it is not appropriate.\"Hanson first wore a burqa in the Senate chamber in 2017. \"Today, the Senate stopped the introduction of my bill to ban the burqa and other full face coverings in public places,\" Hanson said on social media this afternoon.\"Despite the ban in 24 countries across the world (including Islamic countries), the hypocrites in our parliament have rejected my bill.\"So if the parliament won&#x27;t ban it, I will display this oppressive, radical, non-religious head garb that risk our national security and the ill treatment of women on the floor of our parliament so that every Australian knows what&#x27;s at stake.\"If they don&#x27;t want me wearing it - ban the burqa.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
