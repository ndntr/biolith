Relatives of the returnees had been coordinating with Syrian authorities and had travelled from Australia to accompany them, camp officials said.READ MORE: Cops searching for Gus charge grandparent with unrelated offencesRashid Omar, an administrator at the camp, said about an hour after departing the remote camp near the border with Iraq on Monday, the families were contacted by officials in Damascus who told them that the procedures for their departure were not complete and that they would not be able to travel. The families then returned to the camp.Hakmiyeh Ibrahim, the camp&#x27;s director, said the planned repatriations were organised by family members of the returnees rather than directly by Australian authorities.The Australian government said it \"is not and will not repatriate people from Syria\".\"Our security agencies have been monitoring – and continue to monitor – the situation in Syria to ensure they are prepared for any Australians seeking to return to Australia,\" a spokesperson for Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said in a statement released to media outlets on Monday night.\"People in this cohort need to know that if they have committed a crime and if they return to Australia they will be met with the full force of the law. \"The safety of Australians and the protection of Australia&#x27;s national interests remain the overriding priority.\"READ MORE: The 296 days Coles has been asked to explainRoj camp houses about 2200 people from about 50 nationalities, mostly women and children, who have supposed links to the extremist group.Most in the camp are not technically prisoners and have not been accused of a crime, but they have, in effect, been detained in the heavily guarded camp, controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.The most well-known resident of the Roj camp, Shamima Begum, was 15 when she and two other girls fled from London in 2015 to marry IS fighters in Syria.Begum married a Dutch man fighting for IS and had three children, who all died. She recently lost an appeal against the British government&#x27;s decision to revoke her UK citizenship.Monday&#x27;s repatriation, if completed, would have been the first this year. Ibrahim, the camp director, said 16 families were repatriated last year, including German, British and French nationals. In 2022, three Australian families were repatriated.READ MORE: Millions miss out on extra day off: public holiday dividesThe fate of the Roj camp and the similar but larger al-Hol camp has been a matter of debate for years. Human rights groups have cited poor living conditions and pervasive violence in the camps, but many countries have been reluctant to take back their citizens who are detained there.Government forces took control of al-Hol camp last month amid fighting with the SDF that led to state forces seizing more than the territory in northeast Syria previously controlled by the Kurdish forces.The UN refugee agency said on Sunday that a large number of residents of al-Hol camp have left and that the Syrian government plans to relocate those who remain.Separately, thousands of accused IS militants who were held in detention centres in northeastern Syria have been transferred to Iraq by the US military to stand trial there.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

The family has cooperated fully with the investigation and want nothing more than to find Gus and reunite him with his mum and dad,\" the statement read.The lawyers also indicated they will not be making any further comments.There is no suggestion Josie or Shannon Murray are involved in the disappearance of Gus and it is not unusual for anyone linked to an investigation to seek out legal advice.READ MORE: Half of Australia set for major soaking, millions warnedEPSTEIN FILES: US officials list hundreds of prominent people named in documentsThe search for Gus No evidence of Gus has been uncovered despite extensive searches of the property, which Detective Superintendent Darren Fielke said has been the \"largest and most intensive\" missing person search ever undertaken by SA Police.A full-scale ground and air search of the property and the surrounding area was launched after Gus went missing. The search area has totalled 706 square kilometres, with the assistance of 80 Australian Defence Force soldiers, drones, mounted officers and aircraft.About 163 SA Police officers have been deployed for the search.A three-day search of six mine shafts near Oak Park Station also failed to uncover any evidence.Police received more than 150 Crime Stoppers tips about the missing boy.Officers returned to the area surrounding Oak Park Station to search for Gus&#x27; remains on February 2, but uncovered no evidence.
