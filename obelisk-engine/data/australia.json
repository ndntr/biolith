Not all or even most of them, but enough to make a difference,\" Meyers said during his November 14 show.READ MORE: Huge threat prompting multiple countries to bring back the military draft READ MORE: Trump hints at decision on Venezuela - is the US about to go to war?\"Republicans losing faith in Trump is a meaningful and real development, and it&#x27;s not coming out of thin air.\"He&#x27;s done a bunch of very specific things to pi-- off MAGA lately.\"Recent poll numbers found Trump&#x27;s approval rating among Republicans has dropped by 13 points since March 2025, according to the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.Meyers also took aim at Trump&#x27;s support for the H1B visa program in the US to bring skilled foreign workers into America to boost manufacturing, after the president claimed US citizens in the \"unemployment line\" can&#x27;t be trusted to work in factories.He joked that Trump would also be in the \"unemployment line\" if he didn&#x27;t come from wealth.\"If you didn&#x27;t have a rich dad, that&#x27;s where you&#x27;d be, my man,\" Meyers continued.\"I mean, without a million bucks you inherited from your father, you&#x27;d be a guy in Queens who lost his job selling vacuums door to door.\"In a fiery response on Truth Social, Trump accused Meyers of suffering from \"an incurable case of Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS)\".READ MORE: Boy, 14, on bail allegedly stabs 19-year-old on quiet Melbourne street The president also called on NBC to fire Meyers.\"He was viewed last night in an uncontrollable rage, likely due to the fact that his &#x27;show&#x27; is a Ratings DISASTER,\" he said.\"Aside from everything else, Meyers has no talent, and NBC should fire him, IMMEDIATELY!\"Trump&#x27;s Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Brendan Carr reposted the message onto his X account.Meyer s has not publicly responded to Trump&#x27;s fiery social media post.He is not the first host to become ensnared in the president&#x27;s retaliation against anti-Trump messaging on late night TV.Fellow comedian Jimmy Kimmel was pulled off the air in September following comments he made about Charlie Kirk&#x27;s assassination.Jimmy Kimmel Live! was temporarily suspended by ABC&#x27;s parent company Disney for criticising the MAGA movement&#x27;s reaction to conservative activist Kirk&#x27;s death.Trump celebrated the decison and said Kimmel is \"not a talented person\", adding he \"was fired because he had bad ratings more than anything else\".Kimmel returned to the air after a week.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
