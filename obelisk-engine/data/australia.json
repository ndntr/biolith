Chronic lower respiratory diseases, such as emphysema and bronchitis, caused just over 9000 deaths, becoming the third leading cause of death in 2024.\"Overall deaths caused by respiratory diseases were at a record low during the first few years of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we&#x27;re now seeing a return to numbers recorded before the pandemic,\" Moran said.\"This includes the flu, which caused 827 deaths in 2024.\"READ MORE: Popular kids&#x27; play product recalled over asbestos fearsDrug and alcohol-induced deaths also increased in 2024.

Opioids and other depressants, including benzodiazepines, were the most common drug class present,\" Moran said.\"Long-term complications of alcohol use, such as liver cirrhosis, was the main cause of alcohol-induced deaths. \"The alcohol-induced death rate has increased over the last five years from 5.4 deaths per 100,000 people in 2020 to 5.9 in 2024.\"READ MORE: BBC apologises to Donald Trump over misleading video editSuicide was the leading cause of premature death, with 3307 people who died having a median age of 46 years.
