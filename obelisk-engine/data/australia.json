Police did not give details of the ages of those who were injured or their conditions.READ MORE: Protesters arrested after smearing custard and crumble on Crown Jewels casePolice adjusted the death toll after they said a 12th victim died in hospital.The shooting happened at a bar inside a hostel in the Saulsville township west of the administrative capital of Pretoria in the early hours of Saturday.Ten of the victims died at the scene and two others died at the hospital, police said.The children killed were a three-year-old boy, a 12-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl.Police said they were searching for three male suspects.“We are told that at least three unknown gunmen entered this hostel where a group of people were drinking and they started randomly shooting,” police spokesperson Brig. Athlenda Mathe told national broadcaster SABC.She said the motive for the killings was not clear.The shootings happened about 4.15am, she said, but police were only alerted at 6am.READ MORE: Families lose everything weeks from Christmas as fires rip through NSW Central CoastSouth Africa has one of the highest homicide rates in the world and recorded more than 26,000 homicides in 2024 — an average of more than 70 a day. Firearms are by far the leading cause of death in homicides.The country of 62 million people has relatively strict gun ownership laws, but many killings are committed with illegal guns, authorities say.There have been several mass shootings at bars — sometimes called shebeens or taverns in South Africa — in recent years, including one that killed 16 people in the Johannesburg township of Soweto in 2022.On the same day, four people were killed in a mass shooting at a bar in another province.Mathe said that mass shootings at unlicensed bars were becoming a serious problem and police had shut down more than 11,000 illegal taverns between April and September this year and arrested more than 18,000 people for involvement in illegal liquor sales.Recent mass killings in South Africa have not been confined to bars, however.Police said 18 people were killed, 15 of them women, in mass shootings minutes apart at two houses on the same road in a rural part of Eastern Cape province in September last year.Seven men were arrested for those shootings and face multiple charges of murder, while police recovered three AK-style assault rifles they believe were used in the shootings.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

V. Soundappan told the outlet he was concerned of the rise injuries.\"I think we need to crack down on the tampering that&#x27;s happening with the bikes, and the responsibility for that starts from home,\" he said.Royal North Shore Hospital emergency and trauma physician Dr Brian Burns also said he has seen a number of \"life-altering\" injuries in e-bike patients, including head trauma.Medical experts said speed is the key factor in many of the injuries.A study published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health earlier this year also found one hospital in Queensland treated about two children per week injured by e-scooters.One in 10 of those injuries were life-threatening or potentially life-threatening, while 37 per cent of those patients suffered a fracture.The warning comes after a teenager suffered serious injuries in Perth&#x27;s west after his-e-bike collided with a car yesterday morning.The 14-year-old was riding along Stirling Highway in Claremont when his bike hit a four-wheel drive turning out of a carpark. He suffered serious leg injuries and was taken to Perth Children&#x27;s Hospital for treatment.The injuries are not life-threatening. Major Crash Investigators are investigating the scene.A WA parliamentary inquiry recently made 33 recommendations for e-bike and e-scooter rules in the state in a bid to make them safer for both riders and pedestrians.Chief among them were tougher penalties for road offences and punishments for retailers who help riders with illegal modifications.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
