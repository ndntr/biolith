          "content": "US President Donald Trump has described his face-to-face with Chinese leader Xi Jinping today as a roaring success, saying he would cut tariffs on China, while Beijing had agreed to allow the export of rare earth elements and start buying American soybeans.The president told reporters aboard Air Force One that the US would lower tariffs implemented earlier this year as punishment on China for its selling of chemicals used to make fentanyl from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.That brings the total combined tariff rate on China down from 57 per cent to 47 per cent.READ MORE: Dad almost killed in freak bed base accident\"I guess on the scale from 0 to 10, with ten being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12,\" Trump said. \"I think it was a 12.\"Trump said that he would go to China in April and Xi would come to the US \"sometime after that\". The president said they also discussed the export of more advanced computer chips to China, saying that Nvidia would be in talks with Chinese officials.Trump said he could sign a trade deal with China \"pretty soon.\"\"We have not too many major stumbling blocks,\" Trump said.READ MORE: Trump makes &#x27;immediate&#x27; nuclear weapons testing order Sources of tension remainDespite Trump&#x27;s optimism after a 100-minute meeting with Xi in South Korea, there continues to be the potential for major tensions between the world&#x27;s two largest economies.Both nations are seeking dominant places in manufacturing, developing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and shaping world affairs like Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine.Trump&#x27;s aggressive use of tariffs since returning to the White House for a second term, combined with China&#x27;s retaliatory limits on exports of rare earth elements, gave the meeting newfound urgency.READ MORE: Renewed search for missing boy Gus to focus on damThere is a mutual recognition that neither side wants to risk blowing up the world economy in ways that could jeopardise their own country&#x27;s fortunes.When the two were seated at the start of the meeting, Xi read prepared remarks that stressed a willingness to work together despite differences.\"Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye with each other,\" he said through a translator.\"It is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then.\"There was a slight difference in translation as China&#x27;s Xinhua News Agency reported Xi as telling Trump that having some differences is inevitable.China did not provide immediate comment on the meeting or any outcomes.READ MORE: Earth at its hottest temperature in 125,000 years, report finds Finding ways to lower the temperatureThe leaders met in Busan, South Korea, a port city about 76 kilometres south of Gyeongju, the main venue for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.In the days leading up to the meeting, US officials signalled that Trump did not intend to make good on a recent threat to impose an additional 100 per cent import tax on Chinese goods, and China showed signs it was willing to relax its export controls on rare earths and also buy soybeans from America.Officials from both countries met earlier this week in Kuala Lumpur to lay the groundwork for their leaders. Afterwards, China&#x27;s top trade negotiator Li Chenggang said they had reached a \"preliminary consensus,\" a statement affirmed by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said there was \" a very successful framework\".Shortly before the meeting today, Trump posted on Truth Social that the meeting would be the \"G2\", a recognition of America and China&#x27;s status as the world&#x27;s biggest economies.The Group of Seven and Group of 20 are other forums of industrialised nations.But while those summits often happen at luxury spaces, this meeting took place in humbler surroundings: Trump and Xi met in a small grey building with a blue roof on a military base adjacent to Busan&#x27;s international airport.The anticipated detente has given investors and businesses caught between the two nations a sense of relief. The US stock market has climbed on the hopes of a trade framework coming out of the meeting.READ MORE: Searchers to drain large dam in renewed search for missing boy Gus Pressure points remain for both US and ChinaTrump has outward confidence that the grounds for a deal are in place, but previous negotiations with China this year in Geneva, Switzerland and London had a start-stop quality to them.The initial promise of progress has repeatedly given way to both countries seeking a better position against the other.\"The proposed deal on the table fits the pattern we&#x27;ve seen all year: short-term stabilisation dressed up as strategic progress,\" Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, said.\"Both sides are managing volatility, calibrating just enough cooperation to avert crisis while the deeper rivalry endures.\"The US and China have each shown they believe they have levers to pressure the other, and the past year has demonstrated that tentative steps forward can be short-lived.For Trump, that pressure comes from tariffs.READ MORE: Cricketer killed in training tragedy remembered as &#x27;shining light&#x27; China had faced new tariffs this year totalling 30 per cent, of which 20 per cent were tied to its role in fentanyl production. But the tariff rates have been volatile. In April, he announced plans to jack the rate on Chinese goods to 145 per cent, only to abandon those plans as markets recoiled.Then, on October 10, Trump threatened a 100 per cent import tax because of China&#x27;s rare earth restrictions. That figure, including past tariffs, would now be 47 per cent \"effective immediately,\" Trump told reporters this afternoon.Xi has his own chokehold on the world economy because China is the top producer and processor of the rare earth minerals needed to make fighter jets, robots, electric vehicles and other high-tech products.China had tightened export restrictions on October 9, repeating a cycle in which each nation jockeys for an edge only to back down after more trade talks.What might also matter is what happens directly after their talks. Trump plans to return to Washington, while Xi plans to stay on in South Korea to meet with regional leaders during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which officially begins on Friday.\"Xi sees an opportunity to position China as a reliable partner and bolster bilateral and multilateral relations with countries frustrated by the US administration&#x27;s tariff policy,\" Jay Truesdale, a former State Department official who is CEO of TD International, a risk and intelligence advisory firm, said.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

However, he had expressed genuine remorse for his actions.His brother Frederick - who acted as the driver but did not lay any blows on MacGill - was sentenced to a nine-month intensive corrections order for intimidating the cricketer.This includes 100 hours of community service work.READ MORE: Toddler of slain mother clung to neighbour &#x27;like koala&#x27; after Easey Street double murder He was also sentenced to an 11-month community corrections order for being present during the assault.Feilo was given a sentence of two years and four months after the judge took into account his immaturity as a 19-year-old at the time as well as his remorse shown.His PTSD also lessened his moral culpability, the judge said.Taking into account time spent in custody, Feilo will served a 21-month intensive corrections order plus engage in 250 hours of community service work. In September, MacGill was convicted for taking part in a drug supply after introducing Person A to another man.One brick of cocaine was successfully exchanged for $330,000 in cash less than a week before the drug rip-off.The cricketer was sentenced to a one-year and 10-month intensive corrections order in May when he was ordered to complete 495 hours of community service work.READ MORE: Mum claims she used recalled sunscreen for two years before skin cancerDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "standfirst": "Victorian Liberal deputy leader Sam Groth is suing the Herald Sun over a series of stories in late July questioning when he began his relationship with his now-wife Brittany.",
          "content": "Stories about the origin of a tennis ace-turned-politician&#x27;s relationship with his wife will be a \"test case\" of Australia&#x27;s privacy exemption for media.Victorian Liberal deputy leader Sam Groth is suing the Herald Sun over a series of stories in late July questioning when he began his relationship with his now-wife Brittany.The three News Corp stories remain up online, including the original article penned by journalist Stephen Drill titled \"How Liberal Party is courting controversy with Sam Groth\".READ MORE: A hand shake, a smile - and the world waits with bated breathThe Groths allege the articles were defamatory and breached Ms Groth&#x27;s privacy under federal tort laws that came into effect in June.Professional journalists and media publishers are exempt when collecting information for preparation to publish or publication of material that has the \"character of news, current affairs or documentary\".In a Federal Court hearing today, the Groths&#x27; barrister Sue Chrysanthou SC argued the stories were not news but \"salacious gossip\".\"We wish to cross-examine the journalist,\" she said.\"In particular, we want discovery of all of the information that the journalist had at time of publication to demonstrate that they had not one piece of information from any person who had any first-hand information about the circumstances of my client&#x27;s relationship when they met.\"And any basis whatsoever, or any first-hand basis, to allege that there was reasonable suggestion that my client Mr Groth was engaging in a crime when he first started his relationship with his now-wife and mother of his two young children.\"It was not sufficient to just look at the evidence of the articles as federal parliament included the element that the content be \"journalistic material\", she argued.\"Clearly, parliament thought that not all publications that purport to be news are news,\" Chrysanthou said.The News Corp outlet&#x27;s equally high-profile barrister Matt Collins KC is pushing for the exemption question to be put to bed before the case proceeds to trial.The publications themselves were enough for the court to make a ruling on whether the exemption applied, Collins suggested.READ MORE: Australia&#x27;s richest people under 40 revealed in new list\"We&#x27;re talking about a front-page article in the highest-selling newspaper in the state about political matters, about the person who aspires to be the deputy premier of the state,\" Collins said.\"Does that have the character of news ... this is the first time this question has arisen.\"Justice Shaun McElwaine noted US courts had grappled for years trying to reconcile the right of privacy with the first amendment, which protects press freedom.He will rule on whether the privacy exemption aspect of the case can be argued in advance of trial after a hearing on November 6.If the privacy element was split off, the judge wryly foreshadowed it would be \"inevitable\" the losing party would appeal the decision and fragment the case.\"I can see what&#x27;s going to happen,\" he said laughing.\"This is basically a test case. This is the first time this provision has been considered.\"Regardless of his ruling and a mediation hearing on November 7, the trial has been set down to run for 10 days from May 11.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

READ MORE: Earth at its hottest temperature in 125,000 years, report finds \"That process will begin immediately.\"The announcement comes hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin said the Kremlin had successfully tested a nuclear-powered drone, which local media previously said was capable of using an atomic explosion to cause a powerful radioactive tsunami.Putin said that during the test, the Poseidon drone travelled on nuclear power for the first time. He didn&#x27;t say where the trials were conducted or give any other details, and the test wasn&#x27;t independently verified.\"For the first time, we managed not only to launch it from its carrier submarine ... but also to activate its nuclear power unit, allowing the vehicle to operate for a certain period of time,\" Putin said. \"In terms of speed and operating depth, there is nothing like this unmanned vehicle anywhere in the world, and it&#x27;s unlikely that anything similar will appear in the near future. And there is no way to intercept it.\"READ MORE: Searchers to drain large dam in renewed search for missing boy GusThe Russian president also claimed the weapon is impossible to intercept.Just three days earlier, Putin also claimed to have successfully tested a new nuclear-powered cruise missile, known as the Burevestnik.Both the Poseidon and Burevestnik were among the six so-called \"super weapons\" announced by Putin in March 2018.READ MORE: &#x27;Devastated&#x27;: Teen cricketer dies after training tragedy It&#x27;s not certain whether Trump has ordered the US to restart testing of nuclear warheads, or just the missiles and other vehicles that would deliver them.Washington hasn&#x27;t carried out any nuclear tests since 1992, while Russia&#x27;s last one came in 1990. However, since the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) came into effect in 1996, other nations have; both India and Pakistan in 1998, and North Korea as recently as 2017.In today&#x27;s social media post, Trump falsely claimed the US has more nuclear weapons than any other nation. \"This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office,\" he added. \"Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice!\"And, just minutes before he met with Chinese President Xi, Trump also issued a warning about Beijing&#x27;s nuclear stockpile.READ MORE: Australia&#x27;s richest people under 40 revealed in new list\"Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within five years,\" he wrote.Russia has the most nuclear warheads in the world, followed closely by the US.China sits in third place, ahead of the United Kingdom and France.– with Associated Press DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

AMSA said it began searching with Queensland Police after the ship&#x27;s captain reported the woman missing to authorities at 9pm last Saturday.Coral Expeditions chief executive Mark Fifield offered his apology to the woman&#x27;s family and said the company was working with authorities in their investigations.\"Coral Expeditions can confirm the tragic death of a passenger on the Coral Adventurer during an excursion to Lizard Island in Queensland,\" he said in a statement.\"While investigations into the incident are continuing, we are deeply sorry that this has occurred and are offering our full support to the woman&#x27;s family.\"The Coral team have been in contact with the woman&#x27;s family, and we will continue to offer support to them through this difficult process.\"We are working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation.\"Queensland Police is investigating the death, but has ruled it non-suspicious.A report is being prepared for the coroner.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
