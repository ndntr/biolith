          "content": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has written to his British counterpart backing any plan to remove former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of royal succession.In the wake of the royal&#x27;s Thursday arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office, the UK government confirmed it was looking at ways to remove him from the line for the throne.Mountbatten-Windsor is eighth in the line of succession and could technically be named regent or temporarily take over the King&#x27;s duties even earlier, although Buckingham Palace has effectively ruled that out.READ MORE: Infamous photo of ex-prince Andrew hung in LouvreIn a letter released tonight, Albanese wrote to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressing his support for removing the former duke of York.\"In light of recent events concerning Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, I am writing to confirm that my Government would agree to any proposal to remove him from the line of royal succession,\" Albanese wrote.\"I agree with His Majesty that the law must now take its full course and there must be a full, fair and proper investigation.\"These are grave allegations and Australians take them seriously.\"The support of Albanese and the leaders of the other Commonwealth countries who retain the UK&#x27;s reigning monarch as their head of state is essential to any plan to remove him.Mountbatten-Windsor&#x27;s arrest followed years of allegations over his links with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who died by suicide in a New York jail in 2019, but the accusation at the heart was that the royal shared confidential trade information with the disgraced financier when he was a trade envoy for the UK. READ MORE: Timeline of events that led to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor&#x27;s arrestHe was released on Thursday night (early Friday AEDT) after spending about 11 hours in custody. He remained under investigation, meaning he was neither charged nor exonerated.Emails released last month by the US Department of Justice appeared to show him sharing reports of official visits to Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore, and sending Epstein a confidential brief on investment opportunities in Afghanistan.He has consistently denied any wrongdoing in his association with Epstein but has not commented on the most recent allegations that have emerged with the release of the Epstein files.READ MORE: The British royal family faces its worst crisis in generations In the wake of the arrest, UK Defence Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC that wiping his chances of being a successor to the throne was the \"right thing to do\" regardless of the outcome.He told BBC radio at the weekend that the UK government had been working alongside Buckingham Palace to stop Mountbatten-Windsor from \"potentially being a heartbeat away from the throne\".UK media quoted unnamed royal sources saying Buckingham Palace would not oppose the move.While King Charles was able to strip his brother of all his royal and military titles and banish him from Royal Lodge, removing him from the line of succession would require legislation in the UK and the other Commonwealth \"realms\", including Australia.READ MORE: Inside the secret operation to arrest former prince AndrewIn November, University College London said if the worst were to happen to King Charles and then Prince William, Prince Harry would be next in line to be named as regent to Prince George, but only if he returned to the UK.Were he to refuse, Mountbatten-Windsor would be next in line, although he was \"unlikely to be considered suitable following his fall from grace\".\"A person can only be removed as a counsellor of state by legislation,\" it said in an FAQ.\"Because seven people can now be called upon to act as counsellors of state, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor is very unlikely to be called upon again.\"- Reported with Associated Press NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

          "content": "Twenty-five members of the Mexican National Guard have been left dead in six separate attacks after special forces killed the notorious leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, the country&#x27;s security secretary says, as much of Mexico fears more violence.Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as \"El Mencho,\" was the boss of one of the fastest-growing criminal networks in Mexico, known for trafficking fentanyl, methamphetamine and cocaine to the US and staging brazen attacks against government officials who challenged the cartel.He was killed after a shootout in his home state of Jalisco as the Mexican military attempted to capture him. Cartel members responded with widespread violence, blocking roads and setting fire to vehicles.READ MORE: Albanese backs push to deliver final Andrew humiliation Mexican Defence Secretary Ricardo Trevilla said Monday that authorities had followed one of Oseguera Cervantes&#x27; romantic partners to his hideout in Tapalpa, Jalisco.Army and National Guard special forces moved in on Sunday morning and immediately came under heavy fire. Eight gunmen were killed there. Oseguera Cervantes and two bodyguards fled into a wooded area where they were seriously wounded in a firefight, Trevilla said. They were flown out along with a wounded soldier, but El Mencho and his bodyguards died en route to Mexico City, he said.In a different location in Jalisco, soldiers also killed another high-ranking cartel member who Trevilla said was coordinating violence and offering more than $US1000 ($1420) for every soldier killed.Also killed on Sunday were a prison guard, an agent from the state prosecutor&#x27;s office and a woman who was not identified by authorities. Security Secretary Omar García Harfuch said 30 criminal suspects were killed in Jalisco and four others were killed in the neighbouring state of Michoacan.READ MORE: Albanese backs push to boot Andrew from royal lineSeveral Mexican states cancelled school on Monday, and local and foreign governments including Australia warned their citizens to stay inside after widespread violence erupted.President Claudia Sheinbaum urged calm, and authorities said all of the more than 250 cartel roadblocks across 20 states had been cleared by Monday.The White House confirmed that the US provided intelligence support to the operation to capture the cartel leader and applauded Mexico&#x27;s army for taking down a man who was one of the most wanted criminals in both countries.Mexico hoped the death of the world&#x27;s biggest fentanyl traffickers would ease Trump administration pressure to do more than against the cartels, but many people were on edge as they waited to see the powerful cartel&#x27;s reaction.READ MORE: The major change set to impact more than 14 million workersMany fear more than violenceThe US Embassy said on X that its personnel in eight cities and in Michoacan would shelter in place and work remotely on Monday, and it warned US citizens in many parts of Mexico to do the same.Cars began circulating in Guadalajara before sunrise Monday with the start of the workweek, a notable change from Sunday, when Jalisco&#x27;s state capital and Mexico&#x27;s second-largest city was almost completely shut down as fearful residents stayed home.More than 1000 people were stuck overnight in Guadalajara&#x27;s zoo, where they slept in buses. On Monday morning, mothers wrapped in blankets carried their toddlers out of the buses for a much-needed bathroom break as police trucks guarded the area.Luis Soto Rendón, the zoo&#x27;s director, said many had been trapped there since 9am on Sunday (2am Monday AEDT), when violence broke out in Jalisco and the surrounding states. Families were left stranded after concluding they could not return home in nearby states like Zacatecas and Michoacan.READ MORE: Brace yourself: state set for epic drenching\"We decided to let people stay inside the zoo for their safety,\" Soto said. \"There are small children and senior citizens.\"José Luis Ramírez, a 54-year-old therapist, was in a long line of people waiting outside a pharmacy, one of the few businesses that were open on Monday in Guadalajara. Families were buying food, medicine, water, diapers and baby formula from pharmacists through a chained door.It was Ramírez&#x27;s first time leaving the house since violence erupted over the weekend, but he struck a hopeful tone saying that despite the bloodshed, civilians needed to move forward.\"We have to not think scared, but be cool-headed, like they say, and take things as they come,\" he said.Traffic was light in the city, and outwardly it appeared that those who could afford to stay home were doing so, while those who had to work were carefully making their way across the city.Irma Hernández, a 43-year-old hotel security guard in Guadalajara, arrived at work early on Monday.She normally takes public transportation to work, but buses were not running, and she had no way to cross the city. Her bosses organised a private car to pick her up. Her family, she said, was staying at home, too scared to leave.\"I am worried because I don&#x27;t know how to get home if something happens,\" she said.Videos circulating on social media on Sunday showed tourists in Puerto Vallarta walking on the beach with smoke rising in the distance.Blow against cartel could be diplomatic coupDavid Mora, Mexico analyst for the International Crisis Group, said the outburst of violence marks a point of inflection in Sheinbaum&#x27;s push to crack down on cartels and relieve US pressures.US President Donald Trump has demanded Mexico do more than to fight the smuggling of fentanyl, threatening to impose more tariffs or take unilateral military action if the country does not show results.There were early signs that Mexico&#x27;s efforts were well received by the US.US Ambassador Ron Johnson recognised the success of the Mexican armed forces and their sacrifice in a statement late Sunday. Under the leadership of Trump and Sheinbaum, he said, \"bilateral cooperation has reached unprecedented levels\".But it may also pave the way for more violence as rival criminal groups take advantage of the blow dealt to the CJNG, Mora said.\"This might be a moment in which those other groups see that the cartel is weakened and want to seize the opportunity for them to expand control and to gain control over Cartel Jalisco in those states,\" he said.\"Ever since President Sheinbaum has been in power, the army has been way more confrontational, combative against criminal groups in Mexico,\" Mora said. \"This is signalling to the US that if we keep cooperating, sharing intelligence, Mexico can do it. We don&#x27;t need US troops on Mexican soil.\"&#x27;El Mencho&#x27; was a major targetWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said via X that the US government provided intelligence support for the operation.\"&#x27;El Mencho&#x27; was a top target for the Mexican and United States government as one of the top traffickers of fentanyl into our homeland,\" she wrote. She commended Mexico&#x27;s military for its work.The US State Department had offered a reward of up to $US15 million for information leading to the arrest of El Mencho. The Jalisco New Generation Cartel is one of the most powerful criminal organisations in Mexico and began operating around 2009.In February 2025, the Trump administration designated the cartel as a foreign terrorist organisation.Sheinbaum has criticised the \"kingpin\" strategy of previous administrations that took out cartel leaders, only to trigger explosions of violence as cartels fractured.The Jalisco cartel has been one of the most aggressive cartels in its attacks on the military — including on helicopters — and is a pioneer in launching explosives from drones and installing mines. In 2020, it carried out a spectacular assassination attempt with grenades and high-powered rifles in the heart of Mexico City against the then-head of the capital&#x27;s police force and now federal security secretary.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

          "content": "Nick Reiner, the 32-year-old son of acclaimed director Rob Reiner, has pleaded not guilty in the US to two counts of first-degree murder in the fatal stabbing of his parents in December.Reiner&#x27;s attorney, Deputy Public Defender Kimberly Greene, entered the plea on his behalf as he stood behind glass in an enclosed custody area of the packed Los Angeles courtroom.The third of Rob Reiner&#x27;s four children, Nick Reiner has been held without bail since his arrest hours after the actor-director and Michele Singer Reiner, his wife of 36 years, were found dead on December 14 at their home in the upscale Brentwood section of Los Angeles.READ MORE: Former UK ambassador to US arrested in Epstein files probe Reiner appeared in court with his head shaved and wearing brown jail clothes. He talked to his lawyer briefly before the judge began the hearing and spoke only to answer yes to a question from the judge. He was not wearing the suicide prevention smock he wore in his first court appearance in December.The judge told Reiner to return to court April 29 for the scheduling of a preliminary hearing where prosecutors will present evidence and a judge will decide if it&#x27;s enough for Reiner to go to trial.District Attorney Nathan Hochman said outside court that his office still hasn&#x27;t decided whether it will seek the death penalty for Reiner.READ MORE: Albanese backs push to boot former prince Andrew from royal succession Reiner&#x27;s not guilty plea is common for criminal defendants at this stage of the case, whatever their longer-term plan might be.Reiner&#x27;s previous attorney, the high-profile private lawyer Alan Jackson, had to quit the case at the hearing in January because of what he called circumstances beyond his and his client&#x27;s control.He said legal ethics would not allow him to say why, but in parting he adamantly declared that \"pursuant to the laws of California, Nick Reiner is not guilty of murder.\"READ MORE: Dozens of troops left dead in bust that killed cartel leader Jackson did not elaborate but said the conclusion came after weeks of intensive investigation before his team had to hand the case off. He said he wanted to push back against false reporting on the case.It&#x27;s not clear who hired Jackson to represent Reiner or who was paying the bill. Generally, defendants use public defenders when they can&#x27;t afford a private attorney.Deputy District Attorney Habib Balian said Monday that his office is still awaiting a full autopsy report in the case, but all other evidence has been turned over to the defence.Rob Reiner, 78, and Michele Singer Reiner, 70, died from \"multiple sharp force injuries,\" the LA County Medical Examiner said in initial findings.Authorities said they were killed hours before the bodies were discovered. A court order has prevented the release of more details and authorities have said nothing about possible motives.Rob Reiner was a prolific director whose work included some of the most memorable and endlessly watchable movies of the 1980s and &#x27;90s.His credits included This is Spinal Tap, Stand By Me, A Few Good Men, and When Harry Met Sally… , during which production he met photographer Michele Singer and married her soon after.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
