That requires information being sent to the right place,\" Chisholm said.\"That email was not even sent to the right place.\"This was despite Optus using the correct email address before the outage.\"Optus had, indeed, regularly been sending outage notifications to the correct outage notification email address in all instances other than the incredibly significant outage of the 18th of September,\" First Assistant Secretary Samual Grunhard said.The hearing was told the telecommunications industry had been told which address to use, and that the correct one is publicly listed on the Australian Communications and Media Authority&#x27;s (ACMA) website.9news.com.au has contacted Optus for comment.READ MORE: A timeline of Optus&#x27; two years of hell The damning revelation comes after telco bosses, including Optus chief executive Stephen Rue, were summoned to a meeting with Communications Minister Anika Wells yesterday as she unveiled new triple-zero watchdog laws.It also coincided with a visit to parliament by Lawrence Wong, the prime minister of Singapore, the home of Optus&#x27; parent company, Singtel.Following a meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Wong said he expected the companies to fully cooperate with the investigation into the outage.\"I understand fully the anger, frustration and outrage at what happened… I&#x27;ve extended my condolences to those impacted by the outage, including the family members and loved ones of those who lost their lives, which is tragic,\" he told reporters.\"All I can do is to say, from a government&#x27;s perspective, we expect our companies to act responsibly.\"READ MORE: The world is anxious and it&#x27;s fuelling a new Australian gold rush Optus had already faced heavy criticism for its handling of and response to the outage, particularly its communication about it.The telco had initially told ACMA that it had only impacted 10 calls, and it wasn&#x27;t until the day after the outage, late on Friday, September 19, that the public was informed about the issue.Rue also admitted Optus received at least five calls to its customer service line about the outage before it was fixed.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

It is a shame!\" Thunberg told journalists and protesters shortly upon arriving.\"I could talk for a very, very long time about our mistreatment and abuses in our imprisonment, trust me, but that is not the story.\"Instead, Thunberg urged world leaders and ordinary citizens around the world to end their \"complicity\" with the \"genocide\" being carried out against Palestinians in Gaza.\"This action was challenging our extremely violent business as usual,\" Thunberg said. \"We cannot take our eyes away from Gaza.\"Israel&#x27;s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza&#x27;s Health Ministry, since the October 7 attacks exactly two years ago. Thousands of Hamas-led militants attacked army bases, farming communities and a music festival, killing about 1200 people and abducting 251 others.- Reported with Associated Press",
