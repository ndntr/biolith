Australians can check their eligibility for the use-it-or-lose-it benefit on MyGov and can call their dentist ahead of time to confirm that they participate in the scheme.The program covers dental services such as examinations, x-rays, cleaning, fissure sealing, fillings, root canals, and extractions, although it doesn&#x27;t cover whitening or braces.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
