          "content": "The 22-year-old Utah man charged with killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk is due back in court as his attorneys seek to disqualify prosecutors in the case over an alleged conflict of interest.Tyler Robinson is charged with aggravated murder in Kirk&#x27;s September 10 shooting on the Utah Valley University campus in Orem, just a few kilometres north of the Provo courthouse. Prosecutors with the Utah County Attorney&#x27;s Office plan to seek the death penalty if Robinson is convicted. Robinson has not yet entered a plea.An 18-year-old child of a deputy county attorney attended the campus event where Kirk was shot. The child, whose name was redacted from court filings, later texted with their father in the Utah County Attorney&#x27;s Office to describe the chaotic events around the shooting, the filings from prosecutors and defence lawyers state.READ MORE: Trump family eyeing Gold Coast property as latest investment Defence attorneys say that personal relationship is a conflict of interest that \"raises serious concerns about past and future prosecutorial decision-making in this case,\" according to court documents. They also argue that the \"rush\" to seek the death penalty against Robinson is evidence of \"strong emotional reactions\" by the prosecution and merits the disqualification of the entire team.The director of a state council that trains prosecutors said he was not aware of any other major case where attorneys had been disqualified for bias.\"I would bet against the defence winning this motion,\" Utah Prosecution Council Director Robert Church said. \"They&#x27;ve got to a show a substantial amount of prejudice and bias.\"Several thousand people attended the outdoor rally where Kirk, a co-founder of Turning Point USA who helped mobilise young people to vote for President Donald Trump, was shot as he took questions from the audience. The adult child of the deputy county attorney did not see the shooting, according to an affidavit submitted by prosecutors.READ MORE: What the Greenland dispute means for NATO \"While the second person in line was speaking with Charlie, I was looking around the crowd when I heard a loud sound, like a pop. Someone yelled, &#x27;he&#x27;s been shot,&#x27; \" the child stated in the affidavit.The child later texted a family group chat to say \"CHARLIE GOT SHOT.\" In the aftermath of the shooting, the child did not miss classes or other activities, and reported no lasting trauma \"aside from being scared at the time,\" the affidavit said.Prosecutors have asked District Judge Tony Graf to deny the disqualification request.READ MORE: Donors give hundreds of thousands to Trump heckler\"Under these circumstances, there is virtually no risk, let alone a significant risk, that it would arouse such emotions in any father-prosecutor as to render him unable to fairly prosecute the case,\" Utah County Attorney Jeffrey Gray said in a filing.Gray also said the child was \"neither a material witness nor a victim in the case\" and that \"nearly everything\" the person knows about the actual homicide is mere hearsay.If the Utah county prosecutors were disqualified, the case would likely be picked up by prosecutors in a county with enough resources to handle a large case. That could be Salt Lake City, or possibly even the state attorney general&#x27;s office, said prosecution council director Church.Prosecutors have said text messages and DNA evidence connect Robinson to the killing. Robinson reportedly texted his romantic partner that he targeted Kirk because he \"had enough of his hatred.\"At recent hearings, Robinson&#x27;s legal team has pushed to limit media access in the high-profile case. Graf has prohibited media from publishing photos, videos and live broadcasts that show Robinson&#x27;s restraints to help protect his presumption of innocence before a trial.The judge has not ruled on a suggestion by the defence to ban cameras in the courtroom.Prosecutors are expected to lay out their case against Robinson at a preliminary hearing scheduled to begin May 18.READ MORE: Trump loses the support of his most influential backer DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
