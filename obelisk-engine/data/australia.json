Trump has previously been dismissive about the idea of Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize coveted by the US president in 2025, leading Venezuela in the wake of US forces kidnapping Maduro to stand trial in New York.Prior to their meeting, he said she did not have the respect or support inside the country to do so, despite the broad international assessment of her electoral success.Since Machado left the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt, while hailing her as \"a remarkable and brave voice\" , said Trump&#x27;s opinion had not changed.READ MORE: Execution of Iranian protester Erfan Soltani postponed, family says It was, Leavitt said, \"a realistic assessment\".Trump has also signalled a willingness to engage with interim president Delcy Rodriguez, a Maduro loyalist and his former vice president.The pair have talked on the phone, with Trump characterising it as a \"great conversation\" on a wide range of topics.Rodriguez, for her part, has varied her tone on the US and Trump.Originally condemning the kidnapping of Maduro and demanding his return, she has since said she is open to diplomacy with the US and may even be willing to open up Venezuela&#x27;s nationalised oil industry to foreign investment. The US, meanwhile, has continued targeting Venezuelan oil tankers, seizing a sixth one this morning.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

She also mentioned plans for world-leading AI chatbot restrictions to be implemented this year. At the same press conference, Wells acknowledged that Australia&#x27;s social media ban is not yet perfect and said work is being done to improve legislation.Age-restricted social media platforms are expected to continue to remove accounts belonging to under-16s as they&#x27;re found or created.Earlier this week, Meta announced it banned 544,052 accounts belonging to users under the age of 16 between December 4 and December 11.Despite wiping more than half a million accounts, Meta has made clear its concerns with the ban.READ MORE: European troops arrive in Greenland as talks with US highlight &#x27;disagreement&#x27; over island&#x27;s future\"The premise of the law, which prevents under-16-year-olds from holding a social media account so they aren&#x27;t exposed to an &#x27;algorithmic experience,&#x27; is false,\" Meta senior account executive Kathleen Walsh said.\"Platforms that allow teens to still use them in a logged-out state still use algorithms to determine content the user may be interested in - albeit in a less personalised way that can be appropriately tailored to a person&#x27;s age.\"She said the ban may also isolate teens from supportive online communities .READ MORE: What the Greenland dispute means for NATO - and the future of EuropeThough millions of accounts have been removed from platforms like Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, real Australian teens previously told 9news.com.au they doubt the ban will work.\"There&#x27;s a lot of loopholes,\" Alicia Liu, 13, said on the day the ban came into effect.At the time she&#x27;d only been barred from one platform, Snapchat, and had already found a workaround.Four of her friends, all aged 14, had not had any of their social media accounts removed. \"Right now I think a lot of teens, the way they help or keep their mental health stable is on social media, talking to their friends or watching creators that help,\" Rose Pickles, 14, said at the time.\"The social media ban feels like a punishment for something we didn&#x27;t create.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

The temperature needs to be lowered,\" Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said during the first hearing in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St Paul.Local leaders say the government is violating free speech and other constitutional rights with the surge of law enforcement.US District Judge Katherine Menendez promised to keep the case \"on the front burner\" and gave the US Justice Department until Monday to file a response to a request for a restraining order.The judge said these are \"grave and important matters,\" and that there are few legal precedents to apply to some of the key points in the case.Justice Department attorney Andrew Warden suggested the approach set by Menendez was appropriate.The judge is also handling a separate lawsuit challenging the tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal officers when they encounter protesters and observers.A decision could be released this week.During a televised speech on Wednesday evening, Governor Tim Walz described Minnesota as being in chaos, saying what&#x27;s happening in the state \"defies belief\".\"Let&#x27;s be very, very clear, this long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement,\" he said.\"Instead, it&#x27;s a campaign of organised brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government.\"Walz added that \"accountability\" will be coming through the courts.READ MORE: The 75 countries Trump is suspending immigrant visas from in latest crackdownMilitary lawyers may join the surgeThe Department of Homeland Security says it has made more than 2000 arrests in the state since early December and is vowing to not back down.The Pentagon is preparing to send military lawyers to Minneapolis to assist.CNN, citing an email circulating in the military, says Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth is asking the branches to identify 40 lawyers known as judge advocate general officers or JAGs, and 25 of them will serve as special assistant US attorneys in Minneapolis.Pentagon spokesperson Kingsley Wilson appeared to confirm the CNN report by posting it on X with a comment that the military \"is proud to support\" the Justice Department.The Pentagon did not immediately respond to emails from The Associated Press seeking more details.It&#x27;s the latest step by the Trump administration to dispatch military and civilian attorneys to areas where federal immigration operations are taking place.The Pentagon last week sent 20 lawyers to Memphis, US Attorney D. Michael Dunavant said.Mark Nevitt, an associate professor at Emory University School of Law and a former Navy JAG, said there&#x27;s concern that the assignments are taking lawyers away from the military justice system.\"There are not many JAGs, but there are over one million members of the military, and they all need legal support,\" he said.READ MORE: Police issue warning after pipe bombs found on Canberra streetsAn official says the agent who killed Good was injuredJonathan Ross, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who killed Good, suffered internal bleeding to his torso during the encounter, a Homeland Security official told The Associated Press.The official spoke to AP on condition of anonymity in order to discuss Ross&#x27; medical condition.The official did not provide details about the severity of the injuries, and the agency did not respond to questions about the extent of the bleeding, exactly how he suffered the injury, when it was diagnosed or his medical treatment.There are many causes of internal bleeding, and they vary in severity from bruising to significant blood loss.Video from the scene showed Ross and other officers walking without obvious difficulty after Good was shot and her Honda Pilot crashed into other vehicles.She was killed after three ICE officers surrounded her SUV on a snowy street a few blocks from her home.Bystander video shows one officer ordering Good to open the door and grab the handle.As the vehicle begins to move forward, Ross, standing in front, raises his weapon and fires at least three shots at close range. He steps back as the SUV advances and turns.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said Ross was struck by the vehicle and that Good was using her SUV as a weapon — a self-defence claim that has been deeply criticised by Minnesota officials.Chris Madel, an attorney for Ross, declined to comment on any injuries.READ MORE: Dual Australian-British citizens caught out by new passport rule&#x27;An agent of peace&#x27;Good&#x27;s family, meanwhile, has hired a law firm, Romanucci & Blandin, that represented George Floyd&#x27;s family in a $US27 million ($40.4 million) settlement with Minneapolis.Floyd, who was black, died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground in the street in May 2020.The firm said Good was following orders to move her car when she was shot. It said it would conduct its own investigation and publicly share what it learns.\"They do not want her used as a political pawn,\" the firm said, referring to Good and her family, \"but rather as an agent of peace for all.\"Students march against ICEWaving signs reading \"Love Melts ICE\" and \"DE-ICE MN,\" hundreds of teenagers left school in St Paul and marched in freezing temperatures to the state Capitol for a protest and rally.The University of Minnesota, meanwhile, informed its 50,000-plus students that there could be online options for some classes when the new term starts next week.President Rebecca Cunningham noted that \"violence and protests have come to our doorstep\".The campus sits next to the main Somali neighbourhood in Minneapolis.- Reported with AP, CNN DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
