          "content": "The brother of Senior Constable Vadim de Waart-Hottart, who was killed in the line of duty, has remembered him as his own \"superhero\".More than 3000 people, including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan, gathered today to attend the funeral at the Victoria Police Academy in Glen Waverley.The 34-year-old Belgian national was one of two police officers shot in cold blood at a Porepunkah property on August 26 whilst they were serving a warrant.READ MORE: Teen girl fighting for life after being attacked by friend&#x27;s dog identifiedDe Waart-Hottart&#x27;s parents made the 22-hour journey from Belgium, and his younger brother Sasha travelled from Switzerland to attend the funeral.Sasha spoke during the service, remembering his brother as \"my very own superhero\". \"He was my Batman,\" he said.\"I could spend hours speaking about my brother, about the wonderful person he is, about all the amazing times we had together.\"But I&#x27;m going to keep this short because I&#x27;m not sure I would be able to get through it without breaking down.\"De Waart-Hottart graduated and entered the force in 2019 and was stationed in Maryborough and St Kilda before joining the Public Order Response Unit.He was known to be a dedicated officer with an unshakeable nature, calm confidence and a drive to help others. Today, he was commemorated with a statue and commendations for his six years of service and the years he would have given.\"He was taken too soon, and you can be assured we will remember you,\" Victoria Police Commissioner Mike Bush said. \"Vale Senior Constable Vadim.\" In a poignant Facebook post earlier this morning, Victoria Police shared a photograph of de Waart-Hottart with an artwork that had been sent to him as a gift of appreciation from a community member some years ago.De Waart-Hottart had attended a mental health incident with a colleague and provided support to that community member when they were in crisis, Victoria Police said.\"As a thank you, that person painted portraits of both officers,\" the post read.\"It&#x27;s a small but powerful reminder of the quiet, positive impact our members have in the community every day – often without recognition or expectation. It&#x27;s through gestures like these that we remember Vadim as someone who devoted his career to helping others.\"Police Association Victoria secretary Wayne Gatt released a statement honouring de Waart-Hottart ahead of the funeral.\"Six years in a job you love is too short. A life that gave more than it took, to have been ended in such a way, is an indescribable injustice and a tragedy,\" Gatt said.\"Senior Constable Vadim de Waart-Hottart, you wore the uniform with honour and you represented it with kindness, compassion and a just heart.\"To your loving family both here and abroad, we want you to know that your loss is shared by the policing family, colleagues and friends of Vadim and an eternally grateful Victorian community.\"Today we farewell Senior Constable Vadim de Waart-Hottart, but we will never forget him.\"De Waart-Hottart was killed alongside his colleague Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson, 59, while attending the Porepunkah property last week.The hunt for accused double murderer Dezi Freeman is continuing in Victoria&#x27;s high country, with 450 police officers dedicated to the search.Detective Neal Thompson&#x27;s funeral will be held on Monday.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
