Its notice declared him \"one of the most dangerous men in the world\" .READ MORE: Which of these images is made by AI? New data reveals most Aussies can&#x27;t tell According to a police intelligence report obtained by Nine newspaper The Age, Hamad is believed to be a major underworld figure who looms large in Melbourne&#x27;s illicit tobacco scene.He was deported from Australia to his native Iraq in 2023 after serving a prison term for drug offences.\"The Hamad syndicate are responsible for a significant number of serious offences, including arsons, extortions [and] shootings linked to the illicit tobacco trade as well as the importation and distribution of illicit tobacco,\" the report reads, according to The Age.The Iraqi Supreme Judicial Council notice says Hamad was detained \"in response to an official request from Australia\".READ MORE: Should Australia be calling Trump out over Greenland threats?\"The accused is one of the most dangerous wanted men in the world,\" the release said.It accused Hamad of involvement with prominent Australian and Middle Eastern crime gangs. Barrett, who last year declared Hamad the AFP&#x27;s top target, issued a statement today saying Iraqi authorities had made the decision to arrest Hamad themselves.\"Late last year, the AFP provided information to law enforcement officials in Iraq about this alleged offender,\" she said.\"Iraqi officials have made an independent decision to arrest this alleged offender after launching their own criminal investigation. \"Barrett said the AFP had \"supercharged\" its efforts to target Hamad internationally, including deploying officers overseas.\"This arrest is a significant disruption to an alleged serious criminal and his alleged criminal enterprise in Australia,\" Barrett said. Hamad is suspected of coordinating the arson attack that killed innocent Melbourne woman Katie Tangey in January 2025 at a Truganina home.Police said the alleged attack was targeted but took place at the wrong address, and that Tangey had no link to the illicit tobacco trade.A $500,000 reward has been offered for information over the firebombing. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Mike Bush welcomed news of Hamad&#x27;s arrest and thanked the AFP \"for its continued work\".\"We will continue to work with the AFP and our international law enforcement partners to assist as required,\" Bush said.\"Victoria Police is determined to drive down organised crime in this state and the havoc it wreaks on innocent members of the community.\"Hamad is also suspected of involvement with the arson attack on the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne in December 2024, according to The Age law and justice editor Chris Vedelago, who broke the story this morning.https://omny.fm/shows/3aw-breakfast-with-ross-and-john/im-stunned-reporter-lifts-lid-on-arrest-of-melbourne-tobacco-kingpin/embed?style=coverVedelago told 3AW this morning he had been \"stunned\" by the news.\"I never actually thought it would happen,\" he said.Vedelago said it was Hamad&#x27;s alleged involvement in the synagogue attack which motivated the push for an arrest, with investigators suspecting he had acted with the involvement of Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guard.Australia ejected the Iranian ambassador from the country last August after federal police alleged the Guard was behind a number of antisemitic attacks around the country. The federal attorney-general&#x27;s office declined to disclose any details.\"As a matter of longstanding policy, the Australian government does not disclose whether it has made or received an extradition request to or from another country or comment on the details of its consideration of particular cases,\" a spokesperson said. The Age investigative reporter Richard Baker said the arrest was a \"massive coup\" for Australian law enforcement.\"There&#x27;s a perception that once you get out of the country... we&#x27;re hit and miss at getting them back,\" he told 3AW.He said the arrest might put fear into a number of underworld figures who resided overseas but still were involved in affairs in Australia.

Al Madina Dawah Centre has been criticised for its association with Haddad, also known as Abu Ousayd.Haddad was reportedly associated with the alleged Bondi terrorist Naveed Akram but has denied any prior knowledge of the attack.He was also found to have breached the Racial Discrimination Act for antisemitic lectures in the Federal Court in July.Al Madina Dawah Centre, which came under new management in December, insisted Haddad held no management or decision-making authority at the centre and had only attended as an occasional guest speaker.READ MORE: Director and actor Timothy Busfield surrenders to police over child sex abuse allegationsIt is not the first site forced to close due to its association with Haddad.Haddad was previously ordered to shut down unauthorised prayer meetings at a venue on Eldon Street in Georges Hall in 2023, which was only approved to operate as a gym.NSW Premier Chris Minns said today&#x27;s permanent closure was \"evidence of the changes that we&#x27;re proposing will work\", referring to a raft of new measures announced this week to crack down on people operating public places of worship without proper planning approval as a way to clamp down on hate preachers from running \"factories of hate\".\"These are done behind closed doors, they&#x27;re not easy to identify, they&#x27;re very difficult to close down,\" he said.\"But increasingly, as a result of the broadcast or dissemination of individual sermons or lectures or hate spewed that we can identify, I don&#x27;t think the rules or laws have been fit for purpose to confront them in our communities.\"Minns said he was \"struck\" when the Bankstown Council could only issue Al Madina Dawah Centre a nominal fine, as he confirmed one of the measures would be increased fines of up to $22,000 for individuals and $220,000 for corporations.
