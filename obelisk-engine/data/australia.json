          "content": "The Sydney Opera House will be flooded in white light at sundown to honour the victims of the Bondi terror attack on the national day of mourning.Today, the national flag is flying at half mast at all federal government and NSW government buildings out of respect for the grief over the 15 people killed in the attack. Another 14 buildings around the country, including the Bondi Pavilion, will also be lit up in white light to honour the victims.READ MORE: Teen arrested after alleged antisemitic attack on boys in Melbourne The theme of today, chosen by the Chabad Community in Bondi, whose Hanukkah event was targeted in the attack, is \"Light will win, a gathering of unity and remembrance\".Speaking earlier today, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the Bondi Beach terror attack remained \"a stain on our nation\".\"Today is an opportunity for us to remember and pay respect to the 15 lives,\" Albanese said.\"A chance for us to, if we have faith, to pray. If we don&#x27;t, to hope that those who still suffer from injuries and are recovering, both physical and mental, have the opportunity to do so.\"He said today was a chance for the country to \"wrap our arms\" around the local Jewish community.\"Today, we share their grief. A grief with no ending, only a beginning,\" he said.National institutions in Canberra and in NSW will be illuminated as a symbol of light this evening.And a commemorative installation, 15 Pillars of Light, will be in place in Canberra and around the country.READ MORE: Trump makes major Greenland U-turn, but continues threats over island \"The pillars will be lit up in locations around the country and will serve as a visible symbol of mourning, remembrance, and national unity,\" Albanese said. Throughout the day, candles were handed out in Martin Place to be lit tonight in windows across Sydney. \"I think it&#x27;s an opportunity to reflect on the victims, but also the contribution they made to our country,\" NSW Premier Chris Minns said.The premier visited a Jewish Care centre in Woollahra, meeting with Rabbi Mendel Kastel and his son, who witnessed the entire attack.READ MORE: Donald Trump appears to mix up Greenland and Iceland four times\"He was actually there. It was a very difficult time,\" Rabbi Mendel Kastel said.\"For a little while, we couldn&#x27;t find him.\"Throughout the day, the shared sentiment was that this must be a turning point. \"We need to remember those who&#x27;ve lost their lives and may their memories be a blessing,\" NSW Opposition Leader Kellie Sloane said. \"The bigger mountain to climb is making sure this never, ever happens again.\"St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral in Melbourne marked the day with a multi-faith vigil.Flags across Adelaide flew at half-mast across the city.In Perth, a service at St George&#x27;s Cathedral offered prayers for the fallen, while this afternoon at St Mary&#x27;s in Sydney, a special mass acknowledged the 15 souls lost in December.All Australians are encouraged to observe a minute&#x27;s silence at 7.01pm AEDT, and to leave a lit candle in their window or on their doorstep in solidarity with the Jewish community.Albanese said this morning radio and television broadcasters would also hopefully hold that minute&#x27;s silence. \"We live in very difficult times, that is the truth,\" Albanese said.\"And in a time of turbulence, I really want this nation to be a light for the world. We have an opportunity to do that.\"Social Services Minister Tanya Plibersek told Today people were also urged to perform a \"mitzvah\", an \"act of goodness and kindness\" for other Australians.READ MORE: Emotional Harry tells court publisher made Meghan&#x27;s life &#x27;a misery&#x27; \"These acts can be as simple as checking in on a neighbour, volunteering time, offering support to local businesses, or donating to those in need,\" Albanese said earlier this week. An invitation-only memorial event, organised by Chabad of Bondi, will be live-streamed from 7pm AEDT on the organisation&#x27;s YouTube channel.The Jewish community will also gather at the Sydney Opera House, which will be lit up in white in a gesture of solidarity and mourning. \"I&#x27;m very thankful the NSW government for giving us this opportunity to reclaim it, not just for us as a Jewish community, but obviously for the whole Australia and globally,\" Rabbi Mendy Ulman said.For more information, visit the federal government&#x27;s information page about the day of mourning.",

          "content": "Two AFL premiership players say they were not present during a brawl at a coastal town as they fight to have criminal charges withdrawn.Richmond&#x27;s Dion Prestia, 33, and Melbourne&#x27;s Steven May, 34, today appeared at Dromana Magistrates Court via videolink for a brief hearing.They were charged with criminal offences in October, about 10 months after a brawl on Point Nepean Road in Sorrento on Victoria&#x27;s Mornington Peninsula.READ MORE: Australia marks national day of mourning over Bondi attackPolice allege two groups were involved in an altercation about 2am on December 27, 2024, with two men taken to hospital with injuries.Prestia has been charged on summons with recklessly causing serious injury, intentionally causing injury and affray.May has been charged on summons with affray.However, both players deny they were present during the brawl and proclaim their innocence.Their lawyer Tony Hargreaves told the court he had provided detailed written submissions to police setting out why the charges ought to be withdrawn.This included a witness statement, which claims neither Prestia nor May were present during the fight, he said.READ MORE: Bill and Hillary Clinton risk prison after vote by Epstein committeeHargreaves said Victoria Police were considering their submission and asked for the case to be adjourned to February for a contest mention.Prosecutor Alex Turner said the matter had just been referred to his unit and agreed to the adjournment.Prestia and May, who remain charged on summons, will face Frankston Magistrates Court on February 20.The pair, who started their AFL careers together at the Gold Coast Suns, previously released statements through their clubs proclaiming their innocence.\"I was not involved in the fight. I was not even physically present when it apparently took place,\" Prestia said, in a statement issued by Richmond in October.\"I deny that I am guilty of these offences and will strenuously defend these charges.\"Melbourne said May had advised them he was not involved and he would \"strongly defend\" the charge in court.Both AFL clubs are supportive of the players.Prestia is a three-time premiership player with Richmond, and won the club&#x27;s best-and-fairest award in 2019.May played for Melbourne in the 2021 premiership and is a dual All-Australian player.",

          "content": "A student has been accused of planning to throw a Molotov cocktail at an Australia Day crowd as part of an alleged terrorist plot to overthrow the government.Sepehr Saryazdi, 24, allegedly planned the attack for Monday&#x27;s celebrations in Queensland to promote a new phase of civilisation powered by artificial intelligence.He is accused of targeting a Gold Coast event, allegedly posting online that he would be leading Australia Day \"riots\" on the popular tourist strip.READ MORE: Coalition splits again as Ley goes quiet and Littleproud rules future &#x27;untenable&#x27;Saryazdi today applied for bail in Brisbane Magistrates Court after being charged with the preparation of or planning for a terrorist act.He bought bottles of alcohol, wrapping paper and a blanket between January 4 and 9 in preparation for the attack, according to court documents.Crown prosecutor Ellie McDonald opposed bail, saying he had made \"extremely concerning\" comments in a Facebook chat.\"He states, &#x27;I&#x27;ll be leading the Gold Coast riots on January 26,\" she said.\"&#x27;If you know people in Melbourne let them know so they can start buying vodka bottles early and stockpiling batches&#x27;.&#x27;\"Saryazdi allegedly said he expected to die during the Gold Coast attack unless he was killed or lobotomised by Australia&#x27;s spy agency ASIO.He allegedly added that his actions were \"purely logical given the trajectory of this nation\".\"I recommend learning how to shoot guns at shooting ranges while you can,\" he allegedly said on Facebook.Saryazdi allegedly told police he saw the government as \"turning tyrannical\" and wanted to replace it with a \"cybernetics\" alternative where society was guided by AI and data analysis.He allegedly had a document titled \"Australia&#x27;s future cybernetics government the next phase of civilisation\". Saryazdi has a Master of Mathematical Sciences from the University of Sydney, according to his online profiles.He also described himself as a PhD candidate with the CSIRO data and digital specialist arm and Australian Centre for Robotics.Saryazdi intended to make national news and bring people together with attention to his disenchantment with the government, his Legal Aid solicitor Hellen Shilton said.He had a very isolated lifestyle and lost contact with his parents since moving interstate to Brisbane, she said.\"He became influenced a bit by the new people he associated with. He was watching videos of protests,\" Shilton said.\"He admits he became quite overwhelmed emotionally. He felt he should do something with the way the world was going ... it was never his intention to hurt anyone.\"At the point of allegedly purchasing the alcohol and other items, reality started to sink in and he had made silly choices about his cause, his solicitor said.\"He has never taken part in any protests, he is obviously misguided,\" Shilton said.Saryazdi&#x27;s argument for bail appeared at odds with his statements to police, magistrate Penelope Hay said.\"Contrary to admissions he made that he intended to throw a Molotov cocktail in a public place on Australia Day and overthrow the government?\" she said.Hay denied Saryazdi bail due to the apparent strength of the prosecution case and his alleged serious link to violent offending.He was remanded in custody and is due to face court again on February 20.",
