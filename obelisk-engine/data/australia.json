          "content": "Smoke has been seen rising from a five-star hotel complex in Bahrain as several nations work to repel or neutralise hundreds of retaliatory Iranian drone and missile strikes.Several videos posted to social media, at least some of which have been verified by CNN, show grey plumes of smoke stretching away from the Crowne Plaza complex in Bahrain&#x27;s Manama region.Bahrain&#x27;s interior ministry said three buildings in the cities of Manama and Muharraq had sustained damage \"as a result of drone attacks and falling debris from an intercepted missile.\"LIVE UPDATES: Trump warns &#x27;we will hit them like never before&#x27;It is unclear if the damage at Crowne is due to debris or a direct strike.State media in Bahrain has reported it has intercepted at least 45 missiles and nine drones since the conflict began.Manama was one of the first targets hit by Iran in response to combined US and Israeli strikes. The city is used as base for the US Navy Unit, the Fifth Fleet and yesterday a warehouse structure used by the US was struck.No US personnel were present at the time of the strike. Bahrain has attracted the ire of Iran because of its sympathetic views and cooperation with the United States, who use the country as a staging point to patrol and enforce regulation in the nearby shipping routes, used for high-value oil trading.EXPLAINED: Potential oil price hike could impact petrol cost in AustraliaYesterday US President Donald Trump urged the Iranian public to \"seize control of your destiny\" by rising up against the Islamic leadership that has ruled the nation since 1979.Iran retaliated by firing missiles and drones toward Israel and US military bases in the region, and exchanges of fire continued into the evening.Some of the first strikes on Iran appeared to destroy the compound of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He was later confirmed killed.The death toll in Iran has grown to 201 people and another 747 injured across 24 provinces, according to the Iranian Red Crescent.Among those killed are 85 people who died following a strike on a girls&#x27; school in southern Iran, according to state news agency IRNA.CNN called Iran&#x27;s retaliatory attacks \"unprecedented\", disrupting air travel in the region and oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz for many hours after the initial strikes.READ MORE: How world leaders have reacted to the US and Israel joint strikes on IranIsrael&#x27;s military said \"dozens\" of missiles had been fired at it by Iran and the barrages continued even after sundown.CNN quoted a source with knowledge of Iran&#x27;s military strategy saying it&#x27;s ready for \"a long war\" and will continue its offence \"until the aggressor is punished\".\"No significant damage has been done to Iran&#x27;s missile and defense capabilities, and Iran has prepared itself for a long war,\" the source added.READ MORE: Luxury Dubai hotel damaged in explosion as missile debris rains down on cityStrikes targeted supreme leader, but were also widespread Smoke rose from the Iranian capital on Saturday although the strikes occurred nationwide. It wasn&#x27;t immediately clear whether the 86-year-old leader was in his offices when the attack occurred.In a video announcing the \"major combat operations,\" Trump told Iranians that \"when we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed that goal, called for \"the brave Iranian people to take their fate into their own hands.\"The strikes during the holy fasting month of Ramadan opened a stunning new chapter in US intervention in Iran, and marked the second time in eight months that the Trump administration has attacked the Islamic Republic during talks over its nuclear program.READ MORE: Who is Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and why was he a target of the US-Israel strikes?Weeks earlier, a US military operation captured Venezuela&#x27;s president, Nicolás Maduro.The targets included members of Iran&#x27;s leadership, according to a US official and another person briefed on the attacks who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an on-going operation. There was no immediate information on whether top officials were killed.The US president reached his decision after weeks of deliberation and an attempt by his envoys to strike a rapid diplomatic agreement that would have forced Iran to abandon long-held red lines.The US military is planning for several days of attacks, two sources told CNN.Even if Iran&#x27;s top leaders are killed, regime change is not guaranteed. Neither the US nor Israel have articulated a vision for what new leadership might look like.Democrats decried that Trump had taken action without congressional authorisation. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration had briefed several Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress in advance of the attack.The UN Security Council said it would meet on Saturday afternoon (8am Sunday AEDT).In a letter to the council, Araghchi said \"all bases, facilities, and assets of the hostile forces in the region shall be regarded as legitimate military objectives.\"Iran also requested an urgent session of the International Atomic Energy Agency&#x27;s Board of Governors about \"these threats to safeguarded nuclear facilities,\" according to a letter posted by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.The UN&#x27;s nuclear watchdog said on X it was closely monitoring developments and had seen \"no evidence of radiological impact\".Rising tensionsTensions have soared in recent weeks as American warships moved into the region.Trump said he wanted a deal to constrain Iran&#x27;s nuclear program at a moment when the country is struggling at home with growing dissent following nationwide protests.The immediate trigger for Saturday&#x27;s strikes appeared to be the unsuccessful latest round of nuclear talks.But they also reflected dramatic changes that have left Iran&#x27;s leadership in its weakest position since the Islamic Revolution nearly half a century ago.Israeli and American strikes last June greatly weakened Iran&#x27;s air defences, military leadership and nuclear program. A regionwide war, sparked by Hamas&#x27; October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, has left Iran&#x27;s network of proxies across the Middle East greatly weakened. US sanctions and global isolation, meanwhile, have decimated Iran&#x27;s economy.Iran responded to the latest strikes by launching missiles and drones targeting Israel and strikes targeting US military installations in Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar. Israel&#x27;s military said Iran fired \"dozens\" of missiles at Israel, with many intercepted and no serious injuries reported. Emergency responder Magen David Adom noted 89 \"lightly injured\" people.At least three explosions were heard on Saturday evening near the Intelligence Ministry building in northern Tehran, witnesses said, adding that air defense systems had begun operating in the area.There was no immediate statement in Iranian media, while Israel&#x27;s military said it had begun a new wave of strikes against missile launchers and aerial defence systems in central Iran.In southern Iran, at least 85 people were reported killed after a girls&#x27; school was struck, and dozens more were wounded, the local governor told Iranian state TV.Capt. Tim Hawkins, a spokesman for US Central Command, said he was \"aware of reports\" that a girls&#x27; school was struck and they were looking into them.Flights across the Middle East were disrupted, and air defence fire thudded over Dubai, the United Arab Emirates&#x27; commercial capital.Shrapnel from an Iranian missile attack on the UAE capital killed one person, state media said.Attack was coordinated between Israel and USThe US military for weeks has amassed forces in the region, even as US and Iranian envoys held talks in Switzerland and Oman.\"Active and serious negotiations have yet again been undermined,\" Oman&#x27;s Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, a key mediator, said on X.\"Neither the interests of the United States nor the cause of global peace are well served by this.\"Israel said the operation has been planned for months with the US.\"Air Force pilots are striking hundreds of targets across Iran, at significant personal risk and in coordination with US strikes,\" Israeli military chief of staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said in a statement.Targets in the Israeli campaign included Iran&#x27;s military, symbols of government and intelligence targets, according to an official briefed on the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss non-public information on the attack.Trump, in seeking to justify the military action, claimed Iran has continued to develop its nuclear program, despite asserting last year the program had been \"obliterated\" by an earlier round of strikes.He acknowledged on Saturday that there could be American casualties, saying \"that often happens in war.\"It was a notable call from a US leader who swept into office on an \"America First\" platform and vowed to keep out of \"forever wars.\"Trump&#x27;s statement listed grievances beyond the nuclear program, stretching back to the beginning of the Islamic Republic, following a revolution in 1979 that turned Iran from an American ally into a fierce foe.The US president said he was aiming to \"annihilate\" the Iranian navy and destroy regional proxies supported by Tehran. He called on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to lay down arms, pledging members would be given immunity, while warning they would face \"certain death\" if they didn&#x27;t.Trump had threatened military action, but held off, following Iran&#x27;s recent crackdown on protests spurred by economic grievances that evolved into a nationwide, anti-government push against the ruling clerics.The Human Rights Activists News Agency says it confirmed more than 7000 deaths in the crackdown and is investigating thousands more. The government has acknowledged more than 3000 killed.Iran has said it hasn&#x27;t enriched uranium since June, but it has blocked international inspectors from visiting the sites America bombed. Satellite photos analysed by The Associated Press have shown new activity at two of those sites, suggesting Iran is trying to assess and potentially recover material there.Iran said it hoped to avert a war, but maintained its right to enrich uranium. Its leaders did not want to discuss other issues, such as its long-range missile program or support for armed groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.Regional effectsThe strikes could rattle global markets, particularly if Iran is able to make the Strait of Hormuz unsafe for commercial traffic. A third of total worldwide oil exports transported by sea passed through the strait in 2025.Saudi Arabia said in an announcement on state-run media that Iran had targeted its capital and its eastern region in an attack that was repelled.Kuwait&#x27;s civil aviation authority said a drone targeted the main international airport, injuring several employees. Kuwait&#x27;s health ministry said 12 people were injured in strikes. Bahrain said a missile attack targeted the US Navy&#x27;s 5th Fleet headquarters in the island kingdom. Explosions could also be heard in Qatar. Jordan said it \"dealt with\" 49 drones and ballistic missiles.The Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen vowed to resume attacks on Red Sea shipping routes and on Israel, according to two senior Houthi officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because there was no official announcement.US embassies or consulates in Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Israel said staffers were told to shelter in place and recommended all Americans \"do the same until further notice.\"Australia quick to react, issues urgent warnings Anthony Albanese issued a statement of support to the US in their strikes, labelling the Iranian regime \"a destabilising force\".\"We support the United States acting to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and to prevent Iran continuing to threaten international peace and security,\" the prime minister said.\"Iran directed at least two attacks on Australian soil in 2024. These appalling acts targeting Australia&#x27;s Jewish community were intended to create fear, divide our society and challenge our sovereignty.\"Albanese pointed out, in addition to sanctioning 200-Iranian linked individuals, Australia \"took the unprecedented steps of expelling Iran&#x27;s Ambassador\".Any Australians who are in Iran have been urged to leave the country, as the government issued a swift statement after news of the attacks broke on Saturday evening. \"There is a risk of reprisal attacks and further escalation across the region,\" it said in an updated travel advisory.\"Closure of airspace around transit hubs may impact flights globally, causing delays and cancellations.\"It also warned the Australian Embassy in Tehran had suspended its operations, meaning the ability for it to offer support for stranded Australians is \"extremely limited\". The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) also urged those in Israel and Lebanon to consider their future plans, advising \"the security situation could deteriorate rapidly throughout Israel with little or no notice\".\" The Australian Government has directed the departure of all dependants of Australian officials posted to Israel in response to the deteriorating security situation in the Middle East,\" they said.- Reported with Associated Press and CNN.
