          "content": "US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said early this morning they’ve agreed to a plan to end the war in Gaza, but it’s unclear whether Hamas will accept the terms.Trump laid out a 20-point plan for ending the Israel-Hamas war and establishing a post-war governance in the war-battered Palestinian territory. Trump&#x27;s plan would establish a temporary governing board that would be headed by Trump and include former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.The plan does not require people to leave Gaza and calls for the war to end immediately if both sides accept it. It also calls for all remaining hostages to be released within 72 hours of Israel accepting the plan.READ MORE: Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban split after 19 years of marriage Trump said Israel would have the “full backing” of the US to take steps to defeat Hamas if it doesn’t accept the proposed peace deal.“I think we are beyond very close,” Trump said at the start of a news conference with Netanyahu where he detailed the plan. “We&#x27;re not quite finished. We have to get Hamas.”“If Hamas rejects your plan, Mr President, or if they supposedly accept it and then do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself,\" Netanyahu said. \"This can be done the easy way or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done.\"READ MORE: Crews to search into the night for boy, 4, missing from remote homestead The president went on to urge Palestinian people to take responsibility “for their destiny” and embrace his peace proposal.Netanyahu earlier extended a formal apology to his Qatari counterpart for a recent military strike targeting Hamas officials in the Gulf emirate that infuriated Arab leaders and triggered rare criticism by the US of Israel.Netanyahu made the call to Qatar&#x27;s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, as he met with Trump, according to the White House.READ MORE: Who is George Soros, the famed philanthropist under attack by Donald Trump? Trump described the exchange between the Israeli and Qatari leader as a “heart-to-heart” call.“As a first step, Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his deep regret that Israel’s missile strike against Hamas targets in Qatar unintentionally killed a Qatari serviceman,” the White House said in a statement.“He further expressed regret that, in targeting Hamas leadership during hostage negotiations, Israel violated Qatari sovereignty and affirmed that Israel will not conduct such an attack again in the future.”The White House talks, and apology from Netanyahu, come at a tenuous moment. Israel is increasingly isolated, losing support from many countries that were long its steadfast allies. At home, Netanyahu’s governing coalition appears more fragile than ever. And the White House is showing signs of impatience.READ MORE: Trump announces 100% tariff on foreign-made moviesThe question now is whether Trump, who has offered steadfast backing to Netanyahu throughout the war, will change his tone and turn up the pressure on Israel to wind down the conflict.As he welcomed Netanyahu to the White House, Trump responded affirmatively when asked by reporters whether he was confident a deal would be soon reached to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas.“I am. I&#x27;m very confident,” Trump said.Netanyahu&#x27;s apology for strike that angered US allyIsrael stuck the headquarters of Hamas’ political leadership in Qatar on September 9 as the group’s top figures gathered to consider a US proposal for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.The strike on the territory of a US ally was a stunning escalation and risked upending talks aimed at winding down the war and freeing hostages.No senior Hamas officials were killed in the strike.The attack on an energy-rich Gulf nation hosting thousands of American troops, which has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas throughout the war and even before, was described by Trump as out of step with Israeli and US interests.And Trump sought to move quickly to assuage his Qatari allies.READ MORE: Crews to search into the night for boy, 4, missing from remote homesteadQatar, meanwhile, condemned the strike as a “flagrant violation of all international laws and norms” as smoke rose over its capital, Doha. Other key US allies in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, promised their support to Qatar.The White House said al Thani welcomed Netanyahu&#x27;s “assurances” and emphasised “Qatar’s readiness to continue contributing meaningfully to regional security and stability.”But even as the White House was spotlighting the apology, Israel’s far right national security minister newly defended the decision to carry out Israel’s attack.Itamar Ben-Gvir, a key coalition partner of Netanyahu’s, in a posting on X called the operation “an important, just and ethical attack.”“It is very good that it happened,” he added.White House urges Israel and Hamas to get to a ceasefire and hostage release dealEarlier Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt urged both sides to finalise an agreement to bring an end to the nearly two-year-old war in Gaza.“Ultimately the president knows when you get to a good deal, both sides are going to leave a little bit unhappy,” Leavitt told reporters. “But we need this conflict to end.”Trump and Netanyahu were first holding talks with aides in the Oval Office and over a private lunch. A joint press conference is expected later.Meanwhile, Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, said Palestinian officials stood ready to work with Trump and Arab countries in bringing an end to the war.“Let us not delay a single minute more in doing what is necessary for this just peace to replace the unbearable reality of today,” Mansour said during a Security Council meeting on the Middle East.READ MORE: Police scale back manhunt for accused cop killer Dezi FreemanTrump growing more frustrated with conflictTrump joined forces with Netanyahu during Israel&#x27;s brief war with Iran in June, ordering US stealth bombers to strike three nuclear sites, and he&#x27;s supported the Israeli leader during his corruption trial, describing the case as a “witch hunt.”But the relationship has become more tense lately. Trump was frustrated by Israel&#x27;s failed strike this month on Hamas officials in Qatar.Last week, Trump vowed to prevent Israel from annexing the West Bank – an idea promoted by some of Netanyahu&#x27;s hard-line governing partners. The international community opposes annexation, saying it would destroy hopes for a two-state solution.On Friday, Trump raised expectations for the meeting with Netanyahu, telling reporters the US was “very close to a deal on Gaza.”READ MORE: &#x27;Just mayhem&#x27;: Shoppers terrified as four arrested in dramatic CBD chaseProposal does not include expulsion of PalestiniansTrump’s proposal to stop the war in Gaza calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages within 48 hours and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian enclave, according to three Arab officials briefed on the plan.They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plan has not been formally unveiled.Hamas is believed to be holding 48 hostages, 20 of whom are believed by Israel to be alive.The militant group has demanded Israel agree to end the war and withdraw from all of Gaza as part of any permanent ceasefire.Trump discussed the plan with Arab and Islamic leaders in New York last week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. It doesn’t include the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza, which Trump appeared to endorse earlier this year.READ MORE: Man arrested after alleged shooting outside Melbourne shopping centreThe 21-point proposal also calls for an end to Hamas rule of Gaza and the disarmament of the militant group, said the officials briefed on the plan. Hundreds of Palestinians, including many serving life sentences, will be released by Israel, according to the proposal.The plan also includes the establishment of an international security force to take over law enforcement in postwar Gaza, they said.A Palestinian committee of technocrats would oversee the civilian affairs of the strip, with power handed over later to a reformed Palestinian Authority, they said. Netanyahu has rejected any role for the authority, the internationally recognised representative of the Palestinians, in postwar Gaza.A Hamas official said the group was briefed on the plan but has yet to receive an official offer from Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The group has repeatedly rejected laying down arms and has linked its weapons to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

A panel of 32 financial experts quizzed about the next rates move came to the unanimous conclusion the RBA has little room to make a cut today.Despite strong consumer spending, rising inflation and increasing unemployment paint a mixed economic picture.The experts canvassed by Finder said the RBA was seeking a step-by-step reduction in the cash rate.READ MORE: Spring weather system to boil some cities, soak others this week\"No doubt the RBA is on a slide down with the cash rate.\"However, the several promised cuts will be spread over quite some time, and we should not expect a cut at every single meeting,\" Tomasz Wozniak, from the University of Melbourne, said.
