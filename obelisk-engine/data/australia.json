Instead, he was chatting with an undercover NYPD agent.READ MORE: First victim of Swiss Alps bar fire identified, scores fighting for life in hospitalsSturdivant, a US citizen, was arrested before any such plan could commence on New Year&#x27;s Eve as he was being released from a medical facility, James C. Barnacle Jr., FBI special agent in charge, said.While the teen planned to carry out an attack that day, it was not tied to a specific New Year&#x27;s event.Sturdivant is currently being held at Gaston County Jail on a federal hold, jail records show . He faces a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years if convicted, Ferguson said.The teen appeared in court for the first time Friday and another hearing is set for January 7.CNN has reached out to his attorney but has not heard back.This appears to be at least the second known alleged attack plot disrupted during the New Year holiday this year, following a separate incident in Los Angeles, where the FBI arrested four people for allegedly working together on a bomb plot that was set to take place around the city on New Year&#x27;s Eve.READ MORE: Man missing after incident at Central Queensland coal mineTeen plotted to &#x27;do Jihad soon,&#x27; authorities saidFrom conversations with two undercover agents, Ferguson said it became clear Sturdivant was planning to \"do Jihad soon,\" clearly outlining to agents the venue for his alleged attack: a local grocery store and a fast food restaurant in Mint Hill, a Charlotte suburb more than 16 kilometres outside the city.During a search warrant executed at Sturdivant&#x27;s home, FBI agents found hammers and knives hidden under his bed, handwritten notes about the alleged plot and a list of targets along with details about what he&#x27;d wear during and how he would execute it.From what authorities described as a manifesto, titled \"New Year&#x27;s Attack 2026,\" investigators gathered that Sturdivant was targeting Jews, Christians and the LGBTQ community to stab \"as many civilians as possible,\" authorities said.The note also had a section headlined as \"martyrdom op,\" which described a plan to attack any law enforcement that responded to the attack with the intent that Sturdivant would die a martyr, the FBI said.Ferguson called the attack \"very well planned,\" adding that Sturdivant \"was preparing for Jihad and innocent people were going to die, and we were very, very fortunate they did not\".READ MORE: Large number of police carrying heavy weapons set to patrol Sydney Ashes series Known to FBI since the age of 14The FBI first learned of Sturdivant in January 2022 when he \"was in contact via social media with an unidentified ISIS member overseas,\" Barnacle said.That member, the FBI said, directed the then 14-year-old to dress in all black, knock on doors and attack people with a hammer, guidance Sturdivant followed closely before a family member stepped in.No charges were filed at the time, Barnacle said, and Sturdivant was referred for psychological care with no access to social media, the FBI was told.A week before Christmas, the Charlotte FBI field office learned he was back online posting pro-ISIS TikToks under a pseudonym authorities verified belonged to him and a two-week investigation into Sturdivant&#x27;s activities ensued.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker on Friday as a customer revolt over Elon Musk’s right-wing politics, expiring US tax breaks for buyers and stiff overseas competition pushed sales down for a second year in a row.Tesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down nine per cent from a year earlier.Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the biggest EV maker.READ MORE: Tesla approves pay packet that could make Elon Musk the first trillionaire It&#x27;s a stunning reversal for a car company whose rise once seemed unstoppable as it overtook traditional automakers with far more resources and helped make Musk the world&#x27;s richest man.The sales drop came despite President Donald Trump&#x27;s marketing effort early last year when he called a press conference to praise Musk as a “patriot” in front of Teslas lined up on the White House driveway, then announced he would be buying one, bucking presidential precedent to not endorse private company products.For the fourth quarter, Tesla sales totaled 418,227, falling short of even the much reduced 440,000 target that analysts recently polled by FactSet had expected.Sales were hit hard by the expiration of a $11,000 ($US7,500) tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.READ MORE: How it&#x27;s believed the deadly Swiss bar tragedy unfolded Tesla stock fell 2.6 per cent to $US438.07 on Friday.Even with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to makeTesla a leader in robotaxi services and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11 per cent.The latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales.The new Model Y costs just under $40,000 ($UA59,000) while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000 ($UA54,000).Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.For fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a three per cent drop in sales and a nearly 40 per cent drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet.Analysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.Musk said earlier last year that a “major rebound” in sales was underway, but investors were unruffled when that didn&#x27;t pan out, choosing instead to focus on Musk&#x27;s pivot to different parts of business.READ MORE: Aussies as young as 17 losing thousands in the disturbing rise of &#x27;pokies influencers&#x27; He has has been saying the future of the company lies with its driverless robotaxis service, its energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory — and much less with car sales.Tesla started rolling out its robotaxi service in Austin in June, first with safety monitors in the cars to take over in case of trouble, then testing without them. The company hopes to roll out the service in several cities this year.To do that successfully, it needs to take on rival Waymo, which has been operating autonomous taxis for years and has far more customers.It also will also have to contend with regulatory challenges.The company is under several federal safety investigations and other probes. In California, Tesla is at risk of temporarily losing its license to sell cars in the state after a judge there ruled it had misled customers about their safety.“Regulatory is going to be a big issue,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a well-known bull on the stock. “We&#x27;re dealing with people&#x27;s lives.”Still, Ives said he expects Tesla&#x27;s autonomous offerings will soon overcome any setbacks.Musk has said he hopes software updates to his cars will enable hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles to operate autonomously with zero human intervention by the end of this year.READ MORE: Police carrying heavy weapons set to patrol Sydney Ashes series The company is also planning to begin production of its AI-powered Cybercab with no steering wheel or pedals in 2026.To keep Musk focused on the company, Tesla’s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.Musk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $82b ($US55b) pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.Musk could become the world&#x27;s first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company SpaceX to the public for the first time in what analysts expect would be a blockbuster initial public offering.",
