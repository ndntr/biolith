          "content": "Three people died during an Optus triple zero failure across South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory that was the result of a network update issue.Optus chief executive Stephen Rue said a technical failure affected about 600 Triple Zero calls on the Optus network. Rue said welfare checks were then conducted across today to all affected households after the issue was fixed.READ MORE: Pilot&#x27;s body recovered from plane crash wreckage in NSW national parkFrom those welfare checks it was established that three of the calls came from households where people passed away.Two of the deaths took place in SA and another in WA. \"Our investigation is ongoing but at this stage I can confirm that approximately 600 customers were potentially impacted, of which a portion of calls did not go through,\" he said.He apologised to the families of those who passed away.\"I am so sorry for your loss What has happened is completely unacceptable. We have let you down. You have my assurance that we are conducting a thorough investigation. \"This should not have happened.\"Minister for Communications, Anika Wells, labelled the incident \"serious and completely unacceptable\", vowing to \"thoroughly investigate\" the outage.READ MORE: Ex-MP&#x27;s &#x27;fall from grace&#x27; as victim tells of pain and fear \"This is incredibly serious and completely unacceptable,\" Wells said in a statement.\"The impact of this failure has had tragic consequences and my personal thoughts are with those who have lost a loved one.\"Wells added that \"all telecommunication providers have obligations to ensure they carry emergency services calls\".Shadow Minister for Communications, Melissa McIntosh, said the failure was \"deeply concerning\".\"Whilst Optus is still undertaking an investigation as to how this occurred, I am very concerned the emergency camp-on arrangements that should have been in place also failed,\" she said.\"There must be a full and thorough investigation into this incident, to establish how and why and most importantly – ensure this never happens again\".Emergency services camp-on arrangements are designed to allow Triple Zero calls to be made even if one phone carrier has no network coverage in the area, by using another mobile network&#x27;s services instead.Optus could face fines of more than $10 million and could be liable for other penalties.It&#x27;s not the first time Optus has had a major outage.Optus was last year ordered to pay more than $12 million for breaches of emergency call rules in November 2023 following an investigation by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).The ACMA found Optus failed to provide access to the emergency call service for 2145 people during the course of the 14-hour outage on November 8, 2023.It said Optus then failed to conduct 369 welfare checks on people who had tried to make an emergency call during the outage.At the time the fine was issued, ACMA Chair Nerida O&#x27;Loughlin said significant penalty reflected the critical nature of the breaches.\"Triple zero availability is the most fundamental service telcos must provide to the public. When an emergency call fails to connect there can be devastating consequences for public health and safety,\" she said.Wells said the Australian Government had \"accepted all recommendations from the previous Optus Outage Review and has fully implemented 12 of the 18 recommendations\", with the remaining six recommendations still underway.

          "content": "An NRL player at the centre of a perjury case against a former police officer believes the sentence handed to the ex-cop should have been harsher.Known as Officer A for legal reasons, he was today given a one-year intensive corrections order, similar to a suspended jail sentence.The officer pleaded guilty to lying in evidence given during the high-profile rape trial of then-St George player Jack de Belin and co-accused Callan Sinclair in 2020.READ MORE: Doctor who blew whistle on mushroom murderer sanctioned\"It was obviously a little bit light, but it is what it is,\" de Belin said outside Wollongong District Court following the sentence.\"What&#x27;s kept Cal and myself so strong throughout this is our innocence.\"Officer A lied in the rape trial about what he found in text messages between de Belin and a contact saved as \"Craig Lawyer\" that were contained on a Nokia mobile phone.READ MORE: &#x27;Obscene&#x27;: Driver given ticket for &#x27;eight seconds&#x27; in parking spotHe falsely testified the texts only contained \"Dragons business\" despite knowing they likely contained privileged conversations between the player and his lawyer Craig Osborne.First charged in December 2018, de Belin and Sinclair faced two trials before charges were dropped by prosecutors in mid-2021.The case cruelled the forward&#x27;s career despite his legal efforts to challenge the NRL&#x27;s controversial no-fault stand-down rule that sidelined him for several years.Despite the perjury offence being serious because of the ex-officer&#x27;s senior position, Judge Christine Mendes found his significant mental health problems lessened the severity of the sentence required.\"He is a highly fragile, broken man,\" she said.READ MORE: Tsunami warnings after huge Russian quakeThe officer had been showing clear signs of undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder for several years leading up to giving the false evidence in February 2020, the judge found.\"Officer A did not seek professional treatment until Feb 2020 ... he was clearly unwell and suffering,\" she said.The judge rejected the prosecution argument the officer had a sophisticated and well-thought-out plan to commit perjury.De Belin and Sinclair denied sexually assaulting a then-19-year-old woman in December 2018, arguing they had a consensual threesome.The woman alleged she was attacked by de Belin in a North Wollongong unit and then cried as the men took turns assaulting her.A Wollongong jury was discharged less than two days into its deliberations in November 2020, having told the court it could \"absolutely not\" reach a verdict on any charges.A Sydney jury, hearing the case in mid-2021, spent more than a week before it too became stuck on nearly all charges.It acquitted de Belin and Sinclair of one charge each, relating to an incident the NRL player testified was accidental, and prosecutors dropped the remaining charges.Sinclair&#x27;s father Terry Sinclair told reporters today he believed police had been motivated by a \"blatant and concerted\" effort to convict a high-profile footballer.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
