Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the shooting as a \"targeted\" and \"evil\" act of antisemitism.LIVE UPDATES: Gunmen were father and son; Sixteen people dead, more injured in Bondi Beach shootingIt occurred three years after the deadly Wieambilla ambush, and almost 11 years to the day since the Sydney Lindt café siege.The Bondi attack is now the deadliest mass shooting in Australia in the 21st century, but it is not the only tragedy the nation has witnessed in the past 25 years.Here is a timeline of some of the worst shootings in Australia since uniform gun laws were introduced after the Port Arthur massacre in 1996.Bondi Beach shooting: December 14, 2025Two gunmen opened fire on Bondi Beach just before 7pm (AEDT) on Sunday, which was also the first day of Hanukkah.A Jewish event was being held on the beach when shots first rang out.Beachgoers and bystanders scattered, some seeking shelter behind cars or taking refuge inside local businesses.Dozens of people were shot and at least 16 people died, including one of the gunmen.Improvised explosive devices were also found at the scene after the attack.The shooting was declared a terror attack by NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon within hours , and Albanese called it an \"act of evil, antisemitism, terrorism\". 9News confirmed the alleged shooters were Sajid Akram, 50, and his son Naveed Akram, 24.Sajid died at the scene and Naveed remains critically injured in hospital under police guard.

The Trains shot another officer in the hip and lit a grass fire in an attempt to locate the fourth officer, who had hidden.Alan Dare, a neighbour, was shot trying to flee the fire.Additional police arrived to the scene and an hours-long standoff ensued. It ended with the deaths of Gareth, Nathaniel and Stacey Train.An inquest in November 2025 found that the Trains were \"psychotically unwell\" with a \"shared delusional disorder\", but not terrorists.READ MORE: Grief-stricken families disappointed by Wieambilla coronial findings Darwin mass shooting: June 4, 2019Benjamin Glenn Hoffmann was high on drugs when he began shooting at the Palms Motel in Darwin in the early evening of June 4, 2019.He fired multiple shots inside the motel, calling out for someone named \"Alex\".Police were called to the scene but Hoffmann fled in a vehicle.He travelled to Gardens Hill Crescent residential apartments, where he fired more shots before moving to the Buff Club, a pub just metres away.Hoffman continued to the Darwin Recycling Centre and NT Police Headquarters, before travelling in a ute back towards the city centre.Police finally arrested him on a main road into the city, about an hour after the first shots were fired.Four people were killed and a fifth was injured.

Katrina&#x27;s mother Cynda Miles, 58, was found dead in the main house and her father Peter Miles was found dead on the verandah.Rifles were uncovered at the property and police quickly ruled the deaths a murder-suicide.Police held Peter Miles responsible for the deaths of his wife, daughter, and grandchildren.READ MORE: The family killed in the Margaret River mass murder-suicide Sydney siege terrorist attack: December 15, 2014On the morning of December 15, 2014, self-styled Muslim cleric Man Haron Monis walked into the Lindt Cafe on Martin Place.An hour later, the store was locked down with more than a dozen hostages inside as Monis brandished a gun.Café manager Tori Johnson was ordered to call Triple Zero and tell police the cafe was under attack.Monis claimed bombs had been planted in Martin Place, Circular Quay and George Street. These claims were later proven false. Police and tactical operations units arrived at the scene believing it to be a possible terror attack.An hours-long standoff ensued and in the early hours of the morning of December 16, Monis shot Johnson dead.

Her memory will live on in our hearts.\" The family gave 9News permission for Matilda&#x27;s image to be run.Rabbis among victims Among the victims was Rabbi Eli Schlanger, 41, who helped organise the Hanukkah event allegedly targeted by two gunmen yesterday.He was named by both the official X account of Hasidic Jewish movement Chabad, and his cousin Zalman Lewis on Instagram, as one of the 15 innocent people killed in the attack.The Chabad.org account said Schlanger was an assistant rabbi at Chabad of Bondi.He was one of the organisers of the \"Chanukah by the Sea\" event, marking the first day of Hanukkah yesterday .\"The rabbi said in the face of darkness, the way forward is to &#x27;be more Jewish, act more Jewish, and appear more Jewish&#x27;,\" the post read.READ MORE: What we know about the Bondi attackersLewis said his cousin was \"truly an incredible guy\".Alex Ryvchin, of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told 9News the rabbi left behind a wife and young children.\"The rabbi was the best of us. This was a man who got up every morning with the purpose of doing good. That&#x27;s all he did,\" he said.\"He drove around and he gave things to charity, and he fed the needy. And he visited prisoners in prisons. And he just lived to do good things.\"Chabad also identified Rabbi Yaakov Levitan, who served as secretary of the Sydney Beth Din centre in Bondi Beach as another victim.Chabad is an international movement of ultra-Orthodox Judaism known for its public candle-lightings in communities across the world.Holocaust survivor killed Chabad.org also named two other victims: Alex Kleytman, a Holocaust survivor, and Reuven Morrison, a member of the Chabad community who divided his time between Sydney and Melbourne.Kleytman&#x27;s wife, Larisa Kleytman, also a Holocaust survivor, confirmed his death to The Australian today.\"He came on Bondi Beach to celebrate Hanukkah, for us it was always a very, very good celebration, for many, many years,\" she said.Alex Kleytman survived the Holocaust with his mother and younger brother in Siberia.He and his wife later migrated to Australia from Ukraine and had been married for nearly 60 years.READ MORE: Albanese says &#x27;justice will be done&#x27; after &#x27;evil&#x27; attack at Bondi BeachFrench citizen among victims A young French national has been identified as one of the victims of yesterday&#x27;s Bondi Beach shooting in Sydney&#x27;s east.French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement posted on X the citizen was Dan Elkayam.\"It is with deep sadness that I learned of the death of our compatriot Dan Elkayam in the anti-Semitic terrorist attack in Sydney.\"My thoughts are with his family and loved ones, and I express to them the full solidarity of the nation.\"French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the country was mourning with Elkayam, and described the shooting that left at least 16 people dead as \"despicable\". \"We mourn with his family and loved ones, with the grieving Jewish community and the Australian people,\" Barrot said in a statement posted to X.\"This despicable act is yet another tragic manifestation of a revolting surge of antisemitic hatred that we must thwart.\"\"France will spare no effort to root out antisemitism wherever it emerges, and to combat terrorism in all its forms.\"Elkayam was a member of the Rockdale Ilinden football club&#x27;s Premier League One team in southern Sydney, which posted a tribute to him today.\"It is with extreme shock and sadness to discover our Premier League 1 player - Dan Elkayam - was a victim of the horrendous, tragic and senseless events at Bondi Beach on Sunday 14th Dec 2025.\"Dan was an integral member of our PL1 Squad in 2025 - who was an extremely talented and popular figure amongst team mates.\"Our deepest and sincerest condolences to Dan&#x27;s family, friends and all that knew him.
