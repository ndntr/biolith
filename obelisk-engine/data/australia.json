Though Obama didn&#x27;t directly address Trump&#x27;s post, he said, \"There&#x27;s this sort of clown show that&#x27;s happening in social media and on television,\" adding that people \"who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect\" appear to not be showing \"any shame about this\".Trump has refused to apologise for the video, blaming a staffer for the mistake and insisting he hadn&#x27;t seen the final frames of the video which contained the offensive content.\"I think it&#x27;s important to recognise that the majority of the American people find this behaviour deeply troubling,\" Obama said.\"It is true that it gets attention. It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s a distraction.\"READ MORE: Two young men hospitalised with stab wounds in capital cityHe argued that the US can restore \"norms, rule of law (and) decency\" by saying \"enough,\" something he said he&#x27;s now \"seeing across the board\".Trump&#x27;s post was widely condemned by a wide range of American politicians and civic leaders, from civil rights chiefs to veteran Republican senators, for its treatment of the nation&#x27;s first Black president and first lady.The US Senate&#x27;s lone Black Republican, Tim Scott of South Carolina, called on Trump to take down the post.\"Praying it was fake because it&#x27;s the most racist thing I&#x27;ve seen out of this White House,\" Scott said.Another Republican, Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, is white but represents the state with the largest percentage of Black residents.Wicker called the post \"totally unacceptable\" and said the president should apologise.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
