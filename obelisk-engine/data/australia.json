Assistant Commissioner Andrew Holland said police were first called to reports of shots fired into a vehicle about 4.20pm.READ MORE: Australia falls silent as nation pays tribute to terror attack victims READ MORE: Man arrested after parts of Ipswich sent into lockdown Officers found a man and a woman dead.A short time later there were reports that more shots had been fired and police found a woman dead and a man with critical injuries on Walker Street, near Yelkin Street.\"A scene like this, any death in a small country town is confronting,\" Holland said.\"A scene where you have people shot by firearms is obviously going to make people very, very tense, very concerned.\"The scene faced by emergency services at that time would have been horrendous, I worry about their safety and I&#x27;m sure they will be looked after.\"Holland said the surviving man had been taken to hospital in a critical condition.READ MORE: Video shows shark leaping out of Sydney river near school rowers READ MORE: Man dies after being struck by garbage truck in North Sydney The gunman has not been publicly identified and Holland would not comment on the relationship between the shooter and the victims.He said all involved were locals.

Saryazdi has a Master of Mathematical Sciences from the University of Sydney, according to his online profiles.He also described himself as a PhD candidate with the CSIRO data and digital specialist arm and Australian Centre for Robotics.Saryazdi intended to make national news and bring people together with attention to his disenchantment with the government, his Legal Aid solicitor Hellen Shilton said.He had a very isolated lifestyle and lost contact with his parents since moving interstate to Brisbane, she said.\"He became influenced a bit by the new people he associated with. He was watching videos of protests,\" Shilton said.\"He admits he became quite overwhelmed emotionally. He felt he should do something with the way the world was going ... it was never his intention to hurt anyone.\"At the point of allegedly purchasing the alcohol and other items, reality started to sink in and he had made silly choices about his cause, his solicitor said.\"He has never taken part in any protests, he is obviously misguided,\" Shilton said.Saryazdi&#x27;s argument for bail appeared at odds with his statements to police, magistrate Penelope Hay said.\"Contrary to admissions he made that he intended to throw a Molotov cocktail in a public place on Australia Day and overthrow the government?\" she said.Hay denied Saryazdi bail due to the apparent strength of the prosecution case and his alleged serious link to violent offending.He was remanded in custody and is due to face court again on February 20.",
