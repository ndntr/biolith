Among the crowd was NSW Premier Chris Minns, federal Opposition Leader Sussan Ley, Wentworth MP Allegra Spender, former prime minister Scott Morrison and the Israeli Ambassor to Australia Amir Maimon.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was notably not in attendance but said before the funeral he would stay away unless he was invited.Normally there are no eulogies at a Jewish funeral, just prayers. But tradition was pushed aside, so the world would know what it has lost.READ MORE: Matilda&#x27;s grieving family break down as they speak at Bondi vigilRabbi Schlanger, who was also a prison chaplain, received a guard of honour from Corrective Services NSW. He would often travel hours out to regional NSW to be with inmates.During the service mourners paid tribute to the \"outstandingly devoted... exemplary and loving husband\", \"supportive and caring son and son-in-law\" and \"loyal and inspirational friend\".Relatives were seen embracing his coffin in grief as the service began.READ MORE: The five questions Australia is asking after the Bondi terror attackRabbi Levi Wolff described Rabbi Schlanger as one of the \"purest, most sincere and passionate people any of us have known\".\"Eli was ripped away from us in the midst of doing what we loved best, spreading love and joy, and caring for his people with endless self-sacrifice,\" Wolff said.\" In his life and in his death, he towered above as one of the highest and holiest souls.\"This loss is massive for the entire Jewish nation, but for our community here, and for Chabad of Bondi, the loss is unspeakable.\" Wolff said Rabbi Schlanger was a proud father-of-five, including a six-week-old son, who would \"keep watching over\" his family.READ MORE: Radio saved the life of Bondi terror attack victim\"We have all been hoping over the last three days that we would wake up and somehow realise that this was all a terrible dream. We can&#x27;t wish that anymore,\" Wolff added.\"We are here, raw and devastated, crying in unbearable pain, along with the entire Jewish people and all good people across Australia and the world over in the wake of the horrific terrorist attack that was perpetrated in our city.\"We mourn the loss of every single precious life, we embrace their families and we wish them strength.\"We pray for the speedy and complete recovery of the injured.\"Just three hours after they said their goodbyes, there was a second funeral - this time for Sydney businessman Reuven Morrison.READ MORE: How everyday Aussies can help in the wake of the Bondi shootingHe was one of the heroes from Sunday, hurling a brick at the gunmen.\"He&#x27;s chasing after the terrorists, in his usual way, swearing at the terrorists, and he throws at them a brick! This is the greatest heroic act that a Jew can do ... to save another Jew,\" a friend said, remembering Morrison.Then, in the late afternoon, Rabbi Yaakov Levitan, a father-of-four, was farewelled at Macquarie Park.\"We saw him physically plucked and torn away from the ones he loved so dearly and the wider community,\" one mourner said in tribute.The funerals marked the official beginning of seven days of mourning but there will be no end date.This community is dealing with another atrocity and, history tells us, the pain will live on forever.If you have been impacted by the terror attack in Bondi there is support available.To contact Lifeline Australia, call 13 11 14 or text 0477 13 11 14.
