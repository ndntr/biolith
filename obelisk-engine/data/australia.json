Detective Senior Constable Jesse Coppel said the group accused the victim of taking photos of people at the pier.\"During the course of the confrontation he&#x27;s shown his phone to the offenders, proven that he&#x27;s not done it and they&#x27;ve proceeded to assault him anyway,\" Coppel said.\"The information we have indicates that people have seen the contents of his phone prior to it being destroyed and there was nothing of that material or that nature on the phone .\"It seems to me as if they have used this as an excuse to confront this man and when it&#x27;s not followed through they&#x27;ve assaulted him anyway regardless.\"Coppel described the behaviour was \"disgusting\" and people deserved to be able to enjoy the beach peacefully. \"People behaving in this way is deplorable, it doesn&#x27;t belong here,\" he said.The man was taken to hospital with a broken arm and has since returned home despite previously intending to spend Christmas in Australia.Coppel said police had not been able to speak with him at length.
