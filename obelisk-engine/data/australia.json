          "content": "The families of the two Melbourne teenagers who died of methanol poisoning in Laos have slammed the less than $200 fine handed to each of the staff who served their deadly drinks.Holly Bowles and Bianca Jones, 19, were killed when they were served alcohol laced with methanol at Nana Backpacker Hostel in Laos in November 2024.The girls&#x27; fathers Shaun Bowles and Mark Jones say they were kept in the dark as a secret court case played out at The People&#x27;s Court of Vang Vieng, Laos.EPSTEIN FILES: FBI&#x27;s shock verdict on Jeffery Epstein revealed\"The best word to describe it is disappointment,\" Mr Bowles said.\"For us not to be told they&#x27;re going ahead is abhorrent,\" Mr Jones added.On January 28, 10 people from Nana Hostel, where the drinks laced with methanol were served, were found guilty of destroying evidence.They each received a suspended sentence and a $185 fine.The staff could now get exit visas to leave the country after a 20-day appeal period.No further charges will be laid in connection with Holly and Bianca&#x27;s death, but a man from the distillery where the spirits were made could still face legal action.\"To think that the Laos authorities believe that those who were involved in killing our daughters is worth $185 is absolutely disgraceful,\" Mr Jones said.The families say they only found out about the judgment through other poisoning victims in the UK and Denmark, rather than the Australian government.HAPPENING NOW: Israeli president labels Bondi massacre &#x27;attack on Australians&#x27; during visit\"As citizens of this country we expect the government to look after their people and get justice for their citizens when they go travelling,\" Mr Jones said.\"We can&#x27;t get into the country. There&#x27;s nothing more we can do. We need the government to do something because we are out of options,\" Mr Bowles added.In a statement, Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the Department of Foreign Affairs has been in regular communication with the womens&#x27; families, updating them as recently as February 5.\"I have made it clear to my Lao counterpart that Australia expects full accountability,\" Wong said.\"I have also made it clear that charges should reflect the seriousness of the tragedy which left six people dead including Holly and Bianca.\"The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is aware that the Vang Vieng District Court sentenced individuals over the destruction of evidence in relation to the death of a US citizen.\"\"We continue to press Lao authorities on the cases relating to Holly and Bianca&#x27;s deaths, and we will continue to support Holly and Bianca&#x27;s families at this distressing time.\"The hostel has since reopened under a different name.\"Six people died in that hotel and they just open it again? It&#x27;s beyond comprehension,\" Mr Jones said, visibly upset.But the grieving fathers conceded nothing will bring back Holly and Bianca who will be forever missed.\"We&#x27;ve got their 21st coming up this year, lots of milestones that come up, but we will continue to remember our beautiful girls,\" Mr Jones said.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
