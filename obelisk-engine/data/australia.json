          "content": "A Queensland corruption watchdog has found former Townsville mayor Troy Thompson had lied to his constituents about his military, health, business and academic history.The Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) yesterday released the findings of its investigation into Troy Thompson, which debunked the assertions he made during his pre-election campaign.Thompson was found to have lied about serving in three army squadrons over five years and actually served for two and a half years as a reservist, largely within the catering corps.READ MORE: Noah learnt about the social media ban on social media. Now, he&#x27;s fighting it in courtThe CCC concluded that he was \"never a member of the Special Air Service Regiment of the Australian Army \".According to the CCC&#x27;s findings, Thompson&#x27;s medical records showed no evidence of his claim that he was diagnosed or suffered from oesophageal cancer or epilepsy, other than his own self-reporting.His LinkedIn page, which was linked to his election campaign materials, claimed he had obtained a Bachelor of Commerce from Griffith University and a Bachelor of Science from Curtin University.He also told the media he had studied business and law.The CCC found he did not hold any of those degrees, and his only qualifications were some technical certificates.Thompson was also found to have released confidential council emails and information, using an encrypted WhatsApp account or his personal email address, to an unauthorised advisor on 32 occasions.READ MORE: Powerful magnitude 6.0 earthquake rocks city in AlaskaThe investigation did not lead to any criminal charges being laid, but the report called for electoral and local government law reform to improve the verification of candidates&#x27; claims and strengthen enforcement of offences like misleading voters or disclosing confidential information.\"The investigation highlighted important issues, including the need for stronger systems and processes to ensure truthful conduct by electoral candidates, better detection and management of false or misleading information, and appropriate handling of confidential material,\" the CCC said in a statement. Thompson said he \"denies committing any kind of misconduct or criminal offence and respectfully declines to provide a response in circumstances where there is the prospect of future criminal proceedings\".The findings bring about 18 months of turmoil to an end. Thompson, who was elected as Townsville mayor in March 2024, sparked doubts over his military history after only wearing his father&#x27;s military medals at ceremonies on Anzac Day. READ MORE: How did the Hong Kong high rise fire turn so deadly, so quickly?He walked back his claims after receiving a dossier from the Department of Defence and told A Current Affair he had made the misrepresentations because he suffered more than 100 concussions and forgot how many years he had served. The CCC began investigating mid-last year.Thompson refused to heed calls to stand down and remained as mayor until he was suspended for 12 months with full pay of $225,000 in November 2024. He formally resigned in October, after local government minister Ann Leahy gave him 14 days to explain why he should not be terminated from the position.\"This resignation is not an admission of wrongdoing,\" he said at the time.Thompson pledged to recontest his seat at the by-election, which was triggered by his resignation, but lost it to a former Katter&#x27;s Australian Party MP Nick Dametto earlier this month.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Benedict Bryant, 47, was found guilty this morning of dangerous driving occasioning the death of Indigenous teen Jai Kalani Wright in February 2022 in an inner Sydney suburb.Judge Jane Culver ruled Bryant should have known placing his car without its lights and sirens activated could have caused a collision which posed a serious risk to the 16-year-old.READ MORE: Couple filmed dolphins on GoPro before deadly shark attackBryant was behind the wheel when he parked the car at the end of a bike path he knew the teen was riding down at speed.After colliding with the car, Jai was thrown off his bike and suffered critical head injuries, dying at Prince Alfred Hospital the following day.While there was no evidence the sergeant was intending to injure or kill the teenager, the judge found a person of his experience should have known creating the obstacle would pose a danger.Judge Culver found Bryant also failed to consider how other parked cars in the intersection would have impacted the boy&#x27;s ability to see the police car in his path.\"The presence of these other vehicles posed a visible and physical obstruction to the accused ... this required the accused to exercise a greater degree of caution,\" she said.More than 40 members of the teenager&#x27;s family packed the Darlinghurst court room, with dozens of others filling an overflow room.READ MORE: Hong Kong fire death toll hits 83, flames still burn in buildingsThere were gasps and tears as the judge revealed her verdict while Bryant sat with his head bowed and eyes closed for most of the proceedings.Speaking outside court, a supporter of Bryant indicated he would be appealing the verdict and said the incident would never have occurred if everyone was \"in bed, like they should be\".Jai&#x27;s father Lachlan Wright said outside court he hoped the verdict could mark a reset of relations between police and First Nations people.\"If things can change in the future, in regards to relationships between Aboriginal people in this country and the police force, maybe this won&#x27;t happen again,\" he said.Bryant will return for sentencing on April 17.For support contact 13YARN 13 92 76 or Lifeline 13 11 14.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

What&#x27;s next is the search and rescue operation,\" he added.It was unclear how many people remained missing or trapped. Hong Kong leader John Lee said contact had been lost with 279 people early yesterday.Authorities did not provide updates on the missing people or how many were still inside the ravaged buildings yesterday during a press conference.Video showed rescuers searching in some apartments in the dark.Orange flames were still seen from inside several windows, though the whole complex was now largely a blackened ruin.READ MORE: Noah learnt about the social media ban on social media. Now, he&#x27;s fighting it in court Firefighters have been trying to control the flames since mid-afternoon on Wednesday, when the fire was believed to have started in bamboo scaffolding and construction netting and then spread across seven of the complex&#x27;s eight buildings.Chan said the blaze spread \"exceptionally fast\" across the towers, and emergency workers struggled to gain access inside.\"Debris and scaffolding were falling from upper floors,\" he told reporters.\"There are also other reasons like high temperature, darkness ... (and) emergency vehicle access was blocked by fallen scaffolding and debris, making our access to the building very difficult.\"More than 70 people were injured, including 11 firefighters, as well as the 94 killed, the Fire Services Department said.About 900 people were evacuated to temporary shelters overnight.READ MORE: $5 billion early Christmas gift could be on the cards for every AussiePope Leo XIV sent a telegram to Hong Kong&#x27;s bishop yesterday, saying he was saddened by the fire and offering prayers for the injured, their families and emergency workers.Resident Lawrence Lee was waiting for news about his wife, who he believed was still trapped in their apartment.\"When the fire started, I told her on the phone to escape. But once she left the flat, the corridor and stairs were all filled with smoke and it was all dark, so she had no choice but to go back to the flat,\" he said, as he waited in one of the shelters overnight.Winter and Sandy Chung, who lived in one of the towers, said they saw sparks fly around as they evacuated on Wednesday afternoon.Although they were safe, they were worried about their home. \"I couldn&#x27;t sleep the entire night,\" Winter Chung, 75, told The Associated Press yesterday.READ MORE: How did the Hong Kong high rise fire turn so deadly, so quickly? Three arrested on suspicion of manslaughterThree men, the directors and an engineering consultant of a construction company, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter.Police have not directly named the company where they work.\"We have reason to believe that those in charge of the construction company were grossly negligent,\" said Eileen Chung, a senior superintendent of police.Police on Thursday also searched the office of Prestige Construction and Engineering Company, which the AP confirmed was in charge of renovations in the tower complex.Police seized boxes of documents as evidence, according to local media. Phones for Prestige rang unanswered.Authorities suspected some materials on the exterior walls of the high-rise buildings did not meet fire resistance standards, allowing the unusually fast spread of the fire.READ MORE: Woman dead, man in hospital after shark attack at NSW beachPolice also said they found plastic foam panels – which are highly flammable – attached to the windows on each floor near the elevator lobby of the one unaffected tower.It was believed to have been installed by the construction company. but the purpose was not clear.Secretary for Security Chris Tang said they would investigate the materials further.Buildings were covered in scaffoldingThe housing complex consisted of eight buildings with almost 2000 apartments for about 4800 residents, including many older people.It was built in the 1980s and had been undergoing a major renovation. Hong Kong&#x27;s anti-corruption agency said yesterday it was launching a probe into possible corruption relating to the renovation project.Officials said the fire started on the external scaffolding of a 32-story tower, then spread on the bamboo scaffolding and construction netting to the inside of the building and then to the other buildings, likely aided by windy conditions.Bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in Hong Kong at building construction and renovation projects, though Lee said officials will meet with industry representatives to discuss a switch to metal scaffolding amid safety concerns.\"While we know that bamboo scaffolding has a long history in Hong Kong, its flame retardancy is inferior to that of metal scaffolding,\" said Eric Chan, the Chief Secretary for Administration.\"For safety reasons, the government believes that a complete switch to metal scaffolding should be implemented in suitable working environments\"Authorities will also be carrying out immediate inspections of all housing estates that are undergoing major renovation work to ensure scaffolding and construction materials meet safety standards.The fire was the deadliest in Hong Kong in decades.In November 1996, 41 people died in a commercial building in Kowloon in a fire that lasted for around 20 hours.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
