On this occasion, we fell short of our aspiration,\" a statement published this morning said.EPSTEIN FILES: Ghislaine Maxwell cites fifth Amendment as she declines to answer inquiry\"Australian officials continue to underscore our expectations of a thorough and transparent investigation and that there is justice for Holly and Bianca.\"The fathers of Bowles and Jones had previously expressed their frustration with being kept in the dark as the court case went underway behind closed doors.ROYALS: King Charles&#x27; explosive declaration as police probe brother&#x27;s Epstein links\"As citizens of this country we expect the government to look after their people and get justice for their citizens when they go travelling,\" Mr Jones told 9news yesterday.\"We can&#x27;t get into the country. There&#x27;s nothing more we can do. We need the government to do something because we are out of options,\" Mr Bowles added.The accused were charged late last month for destroying evidence, with those verdicts relating to the death of a US citizen who also drank the tainted alcohol at the hostel.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
