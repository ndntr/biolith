Officers will also have the right to stop and search anyone or any vehicle without a warrant.Failure to comply with lawful police direction could result in fines of up to $5500 or exclusion from the major event area.A heavy motorcade is believed to be transporting the Israeli president around the city.READ MORE: WA braces for Severe Tropical Cyclone Mitchell to make landfall The proposed route of Monday&#x27;s pro-Palestine march falls within the exclusion zone. The Palestine Action Group (PAG) said up to 5000 people would march from Town Hall to state parliament to oppose the visit.Police want the rally be confined to Hyde Park.This afternoon, lawyers for PAG launched last-minute legal action against the extra police powers.The judge said there would not be a decision on the challenge to the police crackdown until at least tomorrow, meaning as it stands, the large rally and march will go ahead.NSW Premier Chris Minns on Saturday urged protesters to remain \"calm and respectful\".He also asked residents to avoid the CBD if they can and confirmed there would be a \"massive\" police presence.\"We can disagree without resorting to clashes or violence on Sydney streets,\" Minns said.\"In fact, that would be devastating for everybody, regardless of your cause.\"PAG spokesman Josh Lees told The Sydney Morning Herald Minns was not using the new laws in the right manner.\"[NSW Premier Chris Minns] is using powers meant for sporting events or cultural events to instead give himself and the NSW Police extraordinary and draconian powers to basically shut down our entire city in the interest of parading out a war criminal to this country,\" he said.Herzog will visit Australia at the invitation of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in the wake of the Bondi terrorist attack.He will arrive in Sydney before travelling to Canberra and Melbourne. READ MORE: Grandmother killed after car crashed through bedroom as she slept The president told the Sydney Morning Herald earlier this week he hoped his visit would be one of \"goodwill\".The purpose of the visit is to \"express our bond, our connection, our love, our affection, our condolences\", he said.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
