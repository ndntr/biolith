          "standfirst": "The world-famous Louvre Museum in Paris was closed for the day after a daring daylight jewel heist.",
          "content": "In a minutes-long strike inside the world&#x27;s most-visited museum, thieves rode a cherrypicker to the Louvre, forced a window into the Galerie d&#x27;Apollon — while tourists pressed shoulder-to-shoulder in the corridors — smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels, officials said.Shaky phone vision has emerged of a man, dressed in a high-visibility vest, allegedly smashing into a display case in the museum&#x27;s gallery. It was among the highest-profile museum thefts in recent memory and comes as Louvre employees have complained of worker and security understaffing.READ MORE: &#x27;Suspicious&#x27; Macca&#x27;s order leads to machete-wielding ambushOne object was found later on Sunday outside the museum, according to Culture Minister Rachida Dati. French daily Le Parisien reported it was the emerald-studded crown of Napoleon III&#x27;s wife Empress Eugénie — gold, diamonds and sculpted eagles — recovered just beyond the walls, broken.The theft unfolded just 250 metres from the Mona Lisa, in what Dati described as \"a four-minute operation\". No one was hurt.Images from the scene showed confused tourists being steered out of the glass pyramid and adjoining courtyards as officers closed nearby streets along the Seine.Also visible was a lift braced to the Seine-facing facade near a construction zone — an extraordinary vulnerability at a palace-museum.READ MORE: Records set to tumble as states swelterA museum already under strainAbout 9.30am (6.30pm AEDT), several intruders forced a window, cut panes with a disc cutter and went straight for the vitrines, officials said. Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said the crew entered from outside using a basket lift.The choice of target compounded the shock. The vaulted Galerie d&#x27;Apollon in the Denon wing, capped by a ceiling painted for Louis XIV, displays a selection of the French crown jewels.The thieves are believed to have approached via the riverfront facade, where construction is under way, used a freight elevator to reach the hall, took nine pieces from a 23-item collection linked to Napoleon and the Empress, and made off on motorbikes, according to Le Parisien.Daylight robberies during public hours are rare. Pulling one off inside the Louvre — with visitors present — ranks among Europe&#x27;s most audacious since Dresden&#x27;s Green Vault museum in 2019, and the most serious in France in more than a decade.It also collides with a deeper tension the Louvre has struggled to resolve: swelling crowds and stretched staff. The museum delayed opening during a June staff walkout over overcrowding and chronic understaffing. Unions say mass tourism leaves too few eyes on too many rooms and creates pressure points where construction zones, freight routes and visitor flows meet.Security around marquee works remains tight — the Mona Lisa is behind bulletproof glass in a bespoke, climate-controlled case.It&#x27;s unclear whether staffing levels played any role in Sunday&#x27;s breach.The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous came in 1911, when the Mona Lisa vanished from its frame, stolen by Vincenzo Peruggia and recovered two years later in Florence.Today the former royal palace holds a roll call of civilisation: Leonardo&#x27;s Mona Lisa; the armless serenity of the Venus de Milo; the Winged Victory of Samothrace, wind-lashed on the Daru staircase; the Code of Hammurabi&#x27;s carved laws; Delacroix&#x27;s Liberty Leading the People; Géricault&#x27;s The Raft of the Medusa. More than 33,000 works — from Mesopotamia, Egypt and the classical world to Europe&#x27;s masters — draw a daily tide of up to 30,000 visitors even as investigators now begin to sweep those gilded corridors for clues.Politics at the doorThe heist spilled instantly into politics. Far-right leader Jordan Bardella used it to attack President Emmanuel Macron, weakened at home and facing a fractured parliament.\"The Louvre is a global symbol of our culture,\" Bardella wrote on X.\"This robbery, which allowed thieves to steal jewels from the French Crown, is an unbearable humiliation for our country. How far will the decay of the state go?\"The criticism lands as Macron touts a decade-long \"Louvre New Renaissance\" plan — about €700 million ($1.26 billion) to modernise infrastructure, ease crowding and give the Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031. For workers on the floor, the relief has felt slower than the pressure.What we know — and don&#x27;tForensic teams are examining the site of the crime and adjoining access points while a full inventory is taken, authorities said. Officials have described the haul as of \"inestimable\" historical value. Recovery may prove difficult.\"It&#x27;s unlikely these jewels will ever be seen again,\" said Tobias Kormind, managing director of 77 Diamonds.\"Professional crews often break down and re-cut large, recognisable stones to evade detection, effectively erasing their provenance.\"The Louvre closed for the rest of Sunday as police sealed gates, cleared courtyards and shut nearby streets along the Seine.Key questions still unanswered are how many people took part in the theft and whether they had inside assistance, authorities said. According to French media, there were four perpetrators: two dressed as construction workers in yellow safety vests on the lift, and two each on a scooter.Investigators are reviewing CCTV from the Denon wing and the riverfront, inspecting the basket lift used to reach the gallery and interviewing staff who were on site when the museum opened, authorities said.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Israel has struck targets in the southern Gaza Strip after saying its troops came under fire from Hamas militants, in the first major test of a US-brokered ceasefire meant to halt more than two years of war.Members of the Palestinian group used an RPG and Israel responded with airstrikes and artillery, the military said on Sunday.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held consultations with Israel&#x27;s security heads and directed the military to take \"strong action\" against any ceasefire violations, but did not threaten to return to war.READ MORE: Louvre Museum hit by robberyHamas said that it was not connected to any clashes in Rafah in southern Gaza.The strikes came as Israel identified the remains of two hostages released by Hamas overnight into Sunday, and the Palestinian group said talks to launch the second phase of ceasefire negotiations have begun.Netanyahu&#x27;s office said the bodies belonged to Ronen Engel, a father of three from Kibbutz Nir Oz, and Sonthaya Oakkharasri, a Thai agricultural worker killed at Kibbutz Be&#x27;eri.Both were believed to have been killed during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, and their bodies were taken to Gaza. Engel&#x27;s wife, Karina, and two of his three children were kidnapped and released in a ceasefire in November 2023.Meanwhile, Israel threatened to keep the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt closed \"until further notice.\" The statement by Netanyahu&#x27;s office said reopening Rafah would depend on how Hamas fulfills its ceasefire role of returning the remains of all 28 deceased hostages.In the past week, Hamas has handed over the remains of 13 bodies, 12 of which have been identified as hostages. Israel said one of the bodies released did not belong to a hostage.Israel has released 150 bodies of Palestinians back to Gaza, including 15 on Sunday, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government. Israel has neither identified the bodies nor said how they died. The ministry has posted photos of dozens of bodies on its website to help families and relatives attempting to locate their loved ones, but the bodies were decomposed, blackened and some were missing limbs and teeth. Only 25 bodies have been identified, the Health Ministry said.After Israel and Hamas exchanged 20 living hostages for more than 1900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, the handover of the remains of deceased hostages and prisoners remains a major issue in the first stage of the ceasefire proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. A major scale-up of aid, including the opening of the Rafah border crossing, for humanitarian aid and people entering or leaving Gaza, is the other central issue.The next stages of the ceasefire will focus on disarming Hamas, Israeli withdrawal from additional areas it controls in Gaza, and future governance of the devastated territory.Second phaseThe Israeli military said on Sunday that militants shot at troops in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, in the Israeli-controlled areas, according to the agreed-upon ceasefire lines. No injuries were reported. A senior Hamas official denied that Hamas was involved. Hamas and Israel have each accused each other of violating the fragile ceasefire.Meanwhile, Hamas says that talks with mediators to start the second phase of the ceasefire have begun.Hazem Kassem, a Hamas spokesman, said in a statement late on Saturday that the second phase of negotiations \"requires national consensus\". He also said Hamas has begun discussions to \"solidify its positions\", without providing further details.According to Trump&#x27;s plan, the negotiations will include disarming Hamas and the establishment of an internationally backed authority to run the embattled Gaza Strip.Kassem reiterated that the group won&#x27;t be part of the ruling authority in a post-war Gaza. Hamas-run government bodies in the Gaza Strip are running day-to-day affairs to avoid a power void, he said.\"Government agencies in Gaza continue to perform their duties, as the vacuum is very dangerous, and this will continue until an administrative committee is formed and agreed upon by all Palestinian factions,\" he said.Kassem called for a Community Support Committee, a body of Palestinian technocrats, to run the day-to-day affairs, to be established promptly.Rafah border crossingIsrael didn&#x27;t open the Rafah border crossing on Sunday, in an attempt to pressure Hamas to return more hostages&#x27; bodies. Hamas says it needs special equipment to locate the bodies of additional hostages, but Israel believes Hamas has access to more bodies than it has returned.The Rafah crossing was the only one not controlled by Israel before the war. It has been closed since May 2024, when Israel took control of the Gaza side. A fully reopened crossing would make it easier for Palestinians to seek medical treatment, travel or visit family in Egypt, home to tens of thousands of Palestinians.On Sunday, the Palestinian Authority&#x27;s Interior Ministry in Ramallah announced procedures for Palestinians wishing to leave or enter Gaza through the Rafah crossing. For those who want to leave Gaza, Palestinian Embassy staff from Cairo will be at the crossing to issue temporary travel documents that allow entry into Egypt. Palestinians who wish to enter the Gaza Strip will need to apply at the embassy in Cairo for relevant entry documents.The Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government in the territory. Its figures are seen as a reliable estimate of wartime deaths by UN agencies and many independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll.Thousands more people are missing, according to the Red Cross.Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the attack that sparked the war.Hamas rejects US claimThe group rejected on Sunday a claim by the US State Department that said it had credible reports of an imminent planned attack by Hamas against residents of Gaza.\"This planned attack against Palestinian civilians would constitute a direct and grave violation of the ceasefire agreement and undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts,\" the US State Department said in a statement on Saturday.Hamas called the claim \"false allegations\", and accused Israel of supporting armed groups operating in Israeli-controlled areas. Hamas urged the US administration to pressure Israel to stop supporting the gangs and \"providing them a safe haven\".Hamas-led fighters clashed with at least two armed groups in eastern Gaza City that the group alleges are involved in looting aid and collaborating with Israel. They executed a handful of suspects in public, in widely condemned street killings.The Interior Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, says its forces were working to restore law and order across areas Israel&#x27;s military withdrew from following the ceasefire.
