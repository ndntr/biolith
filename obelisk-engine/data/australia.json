That email was never sent. The email is false,\" he said.\" I don&#x27;t know what his thinking was there.

In retrospect, that was a dead end,\" he said. \"I was foolish to spend time with him.

The same with polio,\" he told 9News in the wide-ranging interview.Now, he sees artificial intelligence as revolutionising healthcare for some of the world&#x27;s poorest countries, but warned it could result in job losses in countries like Australia. \"I think it&#x27;s up to people in the field to say to society at large, this could really be disruptive ,\" he said.Speaking about social media, Gates praised Australia&#x27;s world-first ban for children under 16 as a \"good idea\". \"I know it&#x27;s not an easy thing to implement. I think it&#x27;s a favour to the world that you&#x27;ll study,\" he said.\"We overprotect kids in the real world; we don&#x27;t let them go out and do things.
