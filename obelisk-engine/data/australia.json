Police also said that three people were arrested on suspicion of acts of terrorism.They are two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s.READ MORE: Australian activists detained after Israeli navy intercepts Gaza flotilla The situation unfolded outside Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue about 9.30am on Thursday (6.30pm AEST) when a man, apparently wearing an explosive belt, drove a car at a group of people and then attacked them with a knife.Counter-Terrorism Policing head Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said his unit had \"declared this as a terrorist incident\" and made two arrests.\"Those who have been killed and injured are at the forefront of our minds, as are their families, friends and all of those who love them,\" he said in a statement to media.\"An attack on our Jewish community today on Yom Kippur is devastating. \"Communities across the UK would normally be marking this holy day are now grieving and worried about their safety.\"Greater Manchester Police said firearms officers shot the suspected attacker within seven minutes of a man calling emergency services to report the incident.READ MORE: One dead after horror highway crashIt took some time to confirm whether the suspect was dead because of concerns he had explosives on him.Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson praised the bravery of security officers and worshippers for stopping the man entering the synagogue.\"We know that a car was driven directly at members of the public outside the Heaton Park Hebrew congregation synagogue on Middleton Road, Crumpsall, in Manchester,\" he said.\"The driver of the car was seen then to attack people with a knife.\"He was wearing about his body a vest which had the appearance of an explosive device.\"Social media vision from outside the synagogue, broadcast by the BBC, showed a police officer shouting \"he has a bomb, go away\" before the suspect was shot.There was a loud noise at the scene as police \"specialist resources gained entry to the suspect&#x27;s vehicle as a precaution\". British Prime Minister Keir Starmer denounced the \"vile\" assailant who \"attacked Jews because they are Jews\".He promised the Jewish community that he would do \"everything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence\".\"I promise you that over the coming days, you will see the other Britain, the Britain of compassion, of decency, of love,\" Starmer said.\"I promise you that this Britain will come together to wrap our arms around your community and show you that Britain is a place where you and your family are safe, secure and belong.\"A police spokesperson said the service was in contact with all the synagogues across the region.\"We know today&#x27;s horrifying attack, on the Jewish community&#x27;s holiest day, will have caused significant shock and fear throughout all of our communities,\" they said.\"We are grateful to the member of the public whose quick response to what they witnessed allowed our swift action, and as a result the offender was prevented from entering the synagogue.\"READ MORE: Measles case confirmed in major capitalPolice asked people to share video or photos of the attack with them instead of on social media. A large number of worshippers who had been held inside following the incident were evacuated after the area was made safe, police said. \"This is every Rabbi&#x27;s or every Jewish person&#x27;s worst nightmare,\" said Rabbi Jonathan Romain, of Maidenhead Synagogue and head of the Rabbinic Court of Great Britain.\"Not only is this a sacred day, the most sacred in the Jewish calendar, but it&#x27;s also a time of mass gathering, and the time when the Jewish community, however religious or irreligious, gathers together.\"READ MORE: Veteran cop cleared after property raided in Porepunkah manhuntWitnesses describe seeing a man &#x27;stabbing anyone near him&#x27;Chava Lewin, who lives next to the synagogue, said she heard a bang and thought it might be a firework until her husband ran inside their house and said there had been a \"terrorist attack\".A witness told her that she saw a car driving erratically crash into the gates of the house of worship.\"She thought maybe he had a heart attack,\" Lewin said.\"The second he got out of the car he started stabbing anyone near him. He went for the security guard and tried to break into the synagogue.\"Video on social media showed police with guns pointed at a person lying on the ground beneath a blue Star of David on the brick wall of the synagogue.A bystander could be heard on the video saying the man had a bomb and was trying to detonate it. When the man tried to stand up, a gunshot rang out and he fell to the ground.Manchester was the site of Britain&#x27;s deadliest attack in recent years, the 2017 suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert that killed 22 people.Authorities declare an emergencyPolice \"declared PLATO,\" the national code-word used by police and emergency services when responding to a \"marauding terror attack\".Starmer flew back to the UK from a summit of European leaders in Copenhagen to chair a meeting of the government&#x27;s emergency committee, COBRA.\"I&#x27;m appalled by the attack at a synagogue in Crumpsall,\" he said on X.\"The fact that this has taken place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, makes it all the more horrific. \"My thoughts are with the loved ones of all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services and all the first responders.\"King Charles said he and Queen Camilla were \"deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the horrific attack\" and shared their \"thoughts and prayers are with all those affected\".The Prince and Princess of Wales wrote a message on social media condemning the attack on the holy day and supporting first responders. The North West Ambulance Service also declared a major incident at the scene on Middleton Road in Crumpsall.\"We are currently assessing the situation and working with other members of the emergency services,\" the trust said in a statement.\"Our priority is to ensure people receive the medical help they need as quickly as possible.\"Antisemitic incidents in the UK have soared following Hamas&#x27; October 7, 2023, attack on Israel and Israel&#x27;s ensuing military campaign in Gaza, according to Community Security Trust, an advocacy group for British Jews that works to eliminate anti-Semitism.More than 1500 incidents were reported in the first half of the year, the second-highest reported since the record set a year earlier.The Community Security Trust, which monitors antisemitism in the UK, said it was working with police and the local Jewish community.\"This appears to be an appalling attack on the holiest day of the Jewish year,\" it said in a post on X. \"We thank the GMP officers and synagogue security who responded immediately to deal with the incident.\" Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said he wanted to recognise how the city&#x27;s Jewish community was feeling.\"Today is Yom Kippur, as I understand, and obviously, I think that explains why people were around, why there was a number of people gathered outside the synagogue, and, you know, while lots of people were attending a service,\" he told BBC Radio Manchester.\"So we understand this is a situation that probably is linked to the fact that it&#x27;s Yom Kippur, you know, a day of celebration for the Jewish community.\" - Reported with Associated Press DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Italy&#x27;s largest union called for a one-day general strike on Friday.This flotilla was the largest yet to try and break the Israeli blockade of Gaza. The activists said they believed that with the sheer number of boats, it would be more difficult for Israeli authorities to intercept them all.The organisers remained in contact with two vessels, though one was expecting that Israeli troops would board it imminently.They also lost contact with one remaining boat whose last co-ordinates showed it to be only a few miles from Gaza&#x27;s shores, inside territorial waters.Activists and European lawmakers detainedIsrael&#x27;s Foreign Ministry posted photos and videos of the activists, saying in a statement on X that they were \"safe and in good health\" and would be transferred to Israel for deportation procedures to Europe.Earlier, live broadcasts overnight from the activists, showed Israeli boats approaching their vessels, spraying them with water canons and flashing bright lights before soldiers boarded the flotilla.Anticipating the interceptions, activists wearing life jackets sat in circles and raised their hands in the air. Some managed to stream the moment live from their mobile phones before tossing their devices into the sea.The night=long operation that carried on as the sun rose appeared to be largely peaceful.Governments around the world decry flotilla&#x27;s interceptionWhile Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is yet to publicly comment on the interception of the flotilla, leaders from Turkey, Colombia, Pakistan, Malaysia and others have condemned the actions.Italy and France, which had warned their activists not to continue the journey and avoid confrontation with Israel, said they were working with Israeli diplomatic authorities to ensure their citizens were transferred to land and deported home swiftly and peacefully.Italy&#x27;s Premier Giorgia Meloni slammed Italian unions for their decision to call a general strike on Friday in solidarity with the flotilla, accusing them of seeking to cause wide disruptions across the country.\"I continue to believe that all this brings no benefit to the Palestinian people. On the other hand, I understand that it will bring a lot of problems to Italian citizens,\" Meloni told reporters upon her arrival in Copenhagen for an informal European Union summit.Turkey&#x27;s Foreign Ministry described the interceptions as an \"act of terrorism\" and a severe breach of international law in a statement late on Wednesday (Thursday morning AEST). The ministry said it was working to ensure the immediate release of Turkish citizens and other activists detained by Israeli forces.Colombia&#x27;s President Gustavo Petro announced late on Wednesday (Thursday morning AEST) that his government will expel Israel&#x27;s diplomatic delegation in the South American country over the interception. Two Colombian citizens are taking part in the flotilla.Petro has repeatedly described Israel&#x27;s siege of Gaza as genocide and broke diplomatic ties with Israel in May 2024 over the Israel-Hamas war.The Colombian leader also announced he will terminate his country&#x27;s Free Trade Agreement with Israel over the flotilla&#x27;s interception, which he said was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s \"new international crime\".Pakistan&#x27;s Foreign Ministry on Thursday also condemned Israel&#x27;s interception, calling it a violation of international law and a threat to civilian lives.The detention of activists was part of Israel&#x27;s \"ongoing aggression,\" it said, adding that Israel&#x27;s blockade of Gaza had caused \"immense suffering\" for more than 2 million Palestinians in the strip.Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, a strong supporter of Palestinians, said Israel&#x27;s actions in blocking the flotilla from reaching Gaza show \"utter contempt not only for the rights of the Palestinian people but also for the conscience of the world\".DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
