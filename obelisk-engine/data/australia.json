          "content": "Anthony Albanese&#x27;s approval rating as prime minister has dropped after the government&#x27;s response to the Bondi terror attack and a growing furore over politicians&#x27; personal expenses.Nearly half of all voters, including 19 per cent who vote Labor, believe the Federal government&#x27;s reaction to last week&#x27;s shooting at a Jewish festival in Bondi has been inadequate, according to the Resolve Political Monitor conducted for the Sydney Morning Herald.This came off the back of an expenses back-and-forth surrounding Communications Minister Anika Wells, who was scrutinised for several taxpayer-funded trips domestically and abroad for her and her family.READ MORE: NSW opposition leader arrived at Bondi as attack unfoldedAlbanese attended a vigil for the victims of the shooting last night, where he was audibly booed and heckled by some of those in attendance. In a poll of 1010 Australians between Wednesday and Saturday, the damage to Albanese&#x27;s image was stark, with his approval rating falling from +6 at the start of the month to -9, a drop of 15 points.It is also the lowest it has been since the election in May.READ MORE: 13 remain in hospital one week after Bondi Beach massacreThe government has said it will implement laws to combat hate speech and antisemitism in the wake of the attack, whilst the prime minister yesterday ordered a review into Australia&#x27;s federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to analyse how the alleged shooters evaded attention in the lead up to the attack.According to the poll, 68 per cent of Coalition voters have called Albanese&#x27;s response to the events in Bondi weak, with several figures including opposition leader Sussan Ley, lining up to attack the prime minister.However, it has not led to a bump in the support of the Coalition or the opposition leader, with Ley&#x27;s approval rating falling from +3 to -4, with Albanese still leading as preferred prime minister 38 per cent to 30 per cent.READ MORE: Hundreds join &#x27;Australia first&#x27; rally despite calls to stopLabor also retains a healthy lead in the two-party preferred vote, staying ahead of the Coalition 54-46.Tackling antisemitism could remain a problem for the prime minister in the new year, with 72 per cent of voters believing there has been a rise in racism since the start of the Israel-Gaza conflict.From this, more than half believe there has been a rise in antisemitism, with only 13 per cent saying there has been a rise in Islamophobia.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Tonight, thanks to the Jewish community of Australia on this last night of Chanukah, you have reclaimed Bondi Beach for us.\"Though the attack targeted Jewish people, Minns said the pain was felt by all Australians.\"The sad truth is this crime has tragically highlighted a deep vein of antisemitic hate in our community. To excuse it as an aberration or a tragic single event is wrong.\"As the late chief rabbi once said, the Jewish cannot fight antisemitism alone, the victim cannot fight the crime, the hated cannot cure the hate. We cannot let the Jewish people carry this burden by themselves, it is Australia&#x27;s responsibility.\"",
