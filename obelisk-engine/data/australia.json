If you come across an injured koala, you should pull off the road safely and call your local wildlife carer for instructions if possible.Always make sure it is safe before you go onto the road to attend to an animal and stop any traffic if necessary. Approach the animal carefully from behind and place a blanket over the koala, enclosing its arms and head.Be careful as the koala is frightened and has very sharp claws.Move the koala to a safe place away from any traffic, handle the animal as little as possible and keep the environment quiet until it arrives at a vet or with a wildlife carer.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
