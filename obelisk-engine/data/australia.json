Al Madina Dawah Centre has also come under new management in the past week, and said it believed it did not need a development application as the previous owners had operated out of the site for four years without any issue.It insisted that Haddad held no management or administration role, operational authority, or decision-making at the centre and had only attended as an occasional guest speaker.READ MORE: NSW expected to pass gun and hate speech laws as premier shakes off challenge \"Al Madina Group rejects any attempt to conflate administrative or planning matters with allegations of extremism, national security, or criminal conduct,\" it said in a statement today.\"Such framing is not only misleading (but) dangerously irresponsible.\"Haddad was previously ordered to shut down unauthorised prayer meetings at a venue on Eldon Street in Georges Hall in 2023 which was only approved to operate as a gym.He, however, failed to comply and was issued with another notice and eventually closed.After media reports emerged that he was preaching from the Al Madina Dawah Centre in May, the council investigated and carried out surveillance of the property.But they found no evidence to issue a notice.After continued surveillance, they gained photo evidence that the address was being used for unauthorised purposes.\"Council needs to make it clear that we have no control over what is preached inside these &#x27;illegal&#x27; prayer halls and our role is to ensure the premises are used in accordance with their authorised use,\" the council spokesperson said.\"We will continue to monitor the centre and will be taking further action if necessary.\"Non-compliance with the order could lead to a $3000 fine for an individual and $6000 fine for a corporation.READ MORE: Non-terror groups that &#x27;hate Australia&#x27; target of new reform Premier Chris Minns said he supported the council&#x27;s decision and offered his support for more operations.\"This is an important change not just for that community but for NSW,\" he told reporters this afternoon.\"I want to make it clear that it is not the end of the matter.\"We need to take decisive steps, whether through planning laws and hate speech, to send the message to those intent on putting hate in people&#x27;s hearts or spreading racism in the community, that they will be met with the full force of the law, and that&#x27;s exactly what happened today.\"Minns added the community can \"expect more of this, not less of it, in the weeks to come\".
