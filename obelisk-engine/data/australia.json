I expect those responsible to face the appropriate consequences,\" she said.\"I understand the school has support in place for the students affected as well as support for the broader school community.\"As this is an active police investigation, it would be inappropriate to comment further.\"READ MORE: Second shooting linked to car, house fires in Sydney&#x27;s west and south-westNSW tightens laws around deepfakesLast month, NSW passed legislation to criminalise using artificial intelligence to create intimate images without consent.It is now punishable by up to three years in jail.Sharing those images, even if a person has not created them, can also land them in jail for the same amount of time.The amendments also cracked down on the creation, recording and sharing of sexually explicit audio that is either real or designed to sound like a real person.Attorney-General Michael Daley said the laws would better protect people, particularly young women, from image-based abuse.\"This bill closes a gap in NSW legislation that leaves women vulnerable to AI-generated sexual exploitation,\" he said at the time.\"We are ensuring that anyone who seeks to humiliate, intimidate or degrade someone using AI can be prosecuted.\"READ MORE: One capital on track to shatter heat record, temperatures soar in another&#x27;Current crisis&#x27; for schools and students Deepfakes are digitally altered photos, videos or voice recordings of someone that have been edited to falsely depict them. Tools to create deepfakes can be exploited to create non-consensual and fake explicit images of a person, with women and girls the most likely targets.The eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, in June said deepfakes are a \"current crisis affecting school communities across Australia\".\"Students have found their image represented in fake nude photos or videos,\" the commissioner wrote at the time.\"Others have received AI-generated explicit content of their peers. Entire school communities have been thrown into turmoil â€“ with families, educators, and students unsure how to respond.\"Inman Grant added that deepfakes are \"increasingly in use\" among young people.Readers seeking support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or beyond blue on 1300 22 4636.Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800.",
