I can confirm that.

And I totally get that,\" Cox said.READ MORE: Massive fireball erupts as Israeli missiles strike Gaza high-rises \"I do too, and so I just want to be careful, as I haven&#x27;t read all of the interview transcripts, and so we&#x27;ll have to wait and see what comes out.\"Cox further elaborated on how investigators have determined that Robinson had been radicalized, pointing to gaming and \"dark internet\" culture as potential factors that contributed to a shift.Cox suggested things changed for Robinson after he dropped out of Utah State University.\"It seemed to happen kind of after that — after he moved back to the southern part of Utah. Clearly, there was a lot of gaming going on, friends that have confirmed that there was kind of that deep, dark internet, Reddit culture and these other dark places of the internet where this person was going deep. You saw that on the casings. … the meme-ification that is happening in our society today,\" he told NBC.In an interview with ABC&#x27;s \"This Week\" with Martha Raddatz, Cox also confirmed reports that acquaintances were joking online with Robinson about photos released by the FBI during the manhunt.\"Those conversations definitely were happening. And they did not believe it was actually him — it was all joking until he admitted that it actually was him,\" he said.Official charges, Cox said, will be filed tomorrow.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Catch!\" – a message that Utah Governor Spencer Cox said Friday \"speaks for itself.\"A family member of Robinson&#x27;s told investigators that the suspected shooter \"had become more political in recent years,\" and in particular had lashed out at Kirk at a recent family dinner, Cox said.READ MORE: People are getting fired for allegedly celebrating Charlie Kirk&#x27;s murder. It looks like a coordinated effort But the messages on the bullet casings also included a mix of memes and allusions to video games, suggesting a deep immersion in an irony-soaked online world where meanings can be difficult to precisely decipher.Those messages included a series of arrows representing the controls used to carry out an attack in the video game Helldivers 2 and lyrics of a popular Italian song linked to anti-fascists – but also popularised more recently in another game, Far Cry 6, and a Netflix series. Several years ago in high school, Robinson – like his family – was politically conservative, and supported President Donald Trump ahead of the 2020 election, one of Robinson&#x27;s former classmates told CNN.READ MORE: They witnessed Charlie Kirk&#x27;s assassination. Now students reckon with the trauma \"When I knew him and his family, they were like diehard Trump,\" said the former classmate.\"When this happened, I was like… I don&#x27;t know what changed.\"Voter registration records show that Robinson is currently registered to vote unaffiliated with any party, although he never cast a ballot, the Washington County clerk said in a statement.The former classmate described Robinson as being \"very, very big into gaming\" and interested in video game design.Robinson and his friends \"would spend their lunches playing the card games and all that kind of stuff,\" he said.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
