Haydon, who grew up on the NSW Central Coast, accompanied the prime minister throughout his 2022 and 2025 election campaigns.Albanese proposed to Haydon on Valentine&#x27;s Day last year, making him the first Australian prime minister to get engaged while in office.The pair kept plans for their nuptials tightly under wraps, largely for security reasons due to rising concerns around political violence across Australia.In August, the PM revealed the ceremony would be a small affair, with no international figures on the guest list.\"It&#x27;s not a political event. It&#x27;s an event between myself and Jodie,\" Albanese told Brisbane radio station B105.Albanese has spoken in the past about the moment he decided Haydon was the woman he wanted to marry.\"This,\" he told the reporter while gesturing towards The Lodge, \"will end one day, and the thing about our relationship is that we enjoy spending time together. Just us. So, when it became clear to me that Jodie was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, and that I couldn&#x27;t imagine a life without her, I made the decision.\"Before popping the question on Valentine&#x27;s Day last year, Albanese said he first spoke to Nathan, his son.\"I respect him and have a good relationship with him, and with his mother. So I asked him to think about it, and then he came back to me and Nathan was supportive. He wants me to be happy, and Nathan and Jodie have a really nice relationship as well.\"",

          "content": "Jetstar passengers are warned to expect more delays today as the airline recovers from cancelling up to 90 flights yesterday. The cancellations were caused by a wider recall of thousands of Airbus aircraft that need immediate maintenance to protect from a problem that injured passengers and caused an emergency landing last month.The problems caused chaos for Jetstar, which uses the Airbus A320 as a significant part of its service in Australia and New Zealand.READ MORE: Melbourne Metro Tunnel finally set to open after years of delays Jetstar told 9news while it expected many of its planes to be flying again as normal today, the knock-on effect would still be felt.\"There may be some flow on delays or cancellations on Sunday as the network fully recovers. We will contact customers by SMS and email if there are any further disruptions,\" a spokesperson for the airline said.Plane manufacturer Airbus found intense solar storms, like solar flares, could cause pilots to lose control of the Airbus A320 series of planes, including A319, A320, and A321s.About 6000 of the single-aisle planes worldwide, which are the bestselling passenger aircraft in the world, need the repairs, but disruption so far has been minimal.\"Analysis of a recent event involving an A320 Family aircraft has revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls,\" Airbus said in a statement.On October 30, JetBlue Flight 1230 — an A320 — was flying from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, when it suddenly dove down in altitude. The pilots made an emergency landing in Tampa, Florida, where about 15 people were taken to a hospital.Airbus investigated the incident and on Friday told airlines in an \"Alert Operators Transmission\" that the fix was needed.The company believes it is the only time this specific problem has happened, but says it \"proactively worked with aviation authorities … keeping safety as our number one and overriding priority.\"Most planes can be repaired in about two hours by simply reverting to the previous software, Airbus told CNN on Saturday, meaning that disruption seems relatively limited despite it being one of the busiest travel weekends for Americans celebrating Thanksgiving.However, for about 900 of the older aircraft affected, the fix is more complicated since they will need to have new hardware manually installed.The Airbus A320 series has what&#x27;s called fly-by-wire controls: physical movements from the pilot run through computers which, in turn, adjust the plane&#x27;s control surfaces.READ MORE: Massive industrial fire in Sydney&#x27;s west could burn for daysAn airworthiness directive from the European Union requires airlines to make the repairs before the planes can carry passengers again.The airlines&#x27; scrambled repairs seemed to avoid any widespread disruption by Saturday morning. Arrivals boards at major airport hubs like Dallas Fort Worth, Dubai, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta, Tokyo Haneda and London Heathrow indicated that most flights were running on time, or with short delays.American Airlines had completed all except four of the 209 aircraft that needed to be updated by Saturday morning, less than the 340 it had earlier predicted, according to a statement from the airline.American initially warned of \"some delays\" as a result of the work, but it said on Saturday it expected no further operational impact. It hopes to have all of the repairs made by Sunday.Delta Air Lines said fewer than 50 of its A321neo aircraft will be impacted and the work should be complete by Saturday morning.\"As safety comes before everything else, Delta will fully comply with a directive and expects any resulting operational impact to be limited,\" the airline said in a statement.Six planes in United Airlines&#x27; fleet are affected and there will be \"minor disruption to a few flights,\" the carrier said.JetBlue, which operates a fleet mostly made up of A320 and A321 aircraft, did not say how many of their planes needed to be fixed, but told CNN in a statement it has already started repairs.\"Our teams are doing everything possible to minimise disruptions to customers as this work is completed,\" JetBlue said. \"We will notify customers of any flight changes and customers can always check their flight status on jetblue.com or on the JetBlue app.\"Airbus and the European Aviation Safety Authority have told airlines to reverse the upgrade before letting affected planes fly again, Simes said.In Europe, Lufthansa, Aer Lingus, Wizz Air, EasyJet and British Airways all said some of their aircraft were affected but downplayed the effect of that on their operations.Meanwhile, the papal plane — known as \"Shepherd One\" — was also affected by the issue, though the Vatican said the necessary updates were carried out on Saturday afternoon, so Pope Leo&#x27;s trip to Turkey and Lebanon will proceed with the same plane.Reported with CNN.
