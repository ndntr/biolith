          "content": "Neo-Nazi Thomas Sewell has been charged over an alleged assault on a group of people following Sunday&#x27;s anti-immigration rally in Melbourne.His arrest this afternoon came hours after he crashed Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan&#x27;s press conference.Sewell was arrested in front of Melbourne Magistrates&#x27; Court, where he had just been representing himself on a number of other charges that included intimidating a police officer.READ MORE: Police descend on accused gunman Dezi Freeman&#x27;s propertyExclusive 9News vision shows Sewell being arrested by several police officers about 3.20pm.Victoria Police confirmed that detectives from the Melbourne Crime Investigation Unit had arrested three men.\"Officers arrested a 32-year-old man from Balwyn, a 23-year-old man from Mooroolbark and a 20-year-old man from Ardeer,\" a spokesperson said.\"They are being interviewed in relation to an ongoing investigation into alleged assaults in King&#x27;s Domain about 5pm on 31 August.\"Just before 9.30pm, police said they had charged all three men over the alleged assault.Sewell was charged with violent disorder, affray, assault by kicking, discharging a missile and other offences.He was remanded in custody to face Melbourne Magistrates&#x27; Court tomorrow. The younger men were both charged with violent order and affray, with the 23-year-old also faces an assault by kicking charge and the 20-year-old is accused of discharging a missile.They were granted bail to face court on December 10. 9News understands the charges are in relation to an alleged incident on Sunday where white supremacists stormed a First Nations camp.Footage of the alleged incident showed a group neo-Nazis charging towards Camp Sovereignty, a sacred site and standing protest in Kings Domain.Members of the group allegedly attacked the Indigenous group with sticks and flag poles.Witnesses also reported seeing the Indigenous flag being burned, which Deputy Premier Ben Carroll called \"appalling\".Sewell&#x27;s arrest came hours after he gatecrashed Allan&#x27;s press conference, where he yelled at the premier over his right to protest.Allan was with Treasurer Jaclyn Symes in North Melbourne when Sewell arrived.\"Why don&#x27;t Australians have the right to protest?\" Sewell could be heard saying.READ MORE: &#x27;Gutless&#x27; attack by neo-Nazis on sacred Indigenous site slammed\"Why do you want to ban us from protesting? Shouldn&#x27;t we have the right to speak in our own country?\" Sewell was held back by security as Allan and Symes quickly left.Sewell was heard telling security, \"You don&#x27;t have the right to put your hands on me\".READ MORE: Fears the country&#x27;s most wanted man is &#x27;getting help&#x27;\"We&#x27;re going to take this country back from politicians like you,\" he said to Allan.Sewell left the scene after Allan, walking away on foot.\"Victoria Police is aware of an incident at a media stand-up in North Melbourne this morning where a man attended and was verbally abusive towards the premier,\" a police spokesperson said.\"The premier&#x27;s security team intervened to ensure the safety of everyone present and the man left shortly after.\"Allan also issued a statement, saying she was \"unharmed and undeterred\".She said it was a \"badge of honour\" to earn the ire of Nazis.\"But this isn&#x27;t about me. It&#x27;s about all the other people in the community who Nazis target - like multicultural people, LGBTIQA+ people, First Peoples, and Jews,\" she said in the written statement.\"They&#x27;re the Victorians who are on my mind right now, and they&#x27;re the Victorians who our anti-hate laws will protect when they come into force later this month.\"The new legislation will strengthen Victoria&#x27;s existing vilification laws, and make it a criminal offence to incite hate or threaten harm based on a protected attribute.\"We know how these goons operate. They whip up fear to divide our society. They will fail,\" Allan said of Sewell.\"Because Victorians are fair, and our values are strong.\"The New Zealand-born white nationalist figure recently made a speech to the crowd at the anti-immigration March For Australia rally in Melbourne on Sunday.In his tirade at the press conference, Sewell also incorrectly claimed 50,000 people attended that rally.On Sunday, he was also seen in a crowd that allegedly attacked an Indigenous encampment, Camp Sovereignty, after splitting off from the main rally.Police are investigating the incident, which Police Minister Andrew Carbines labelled \"gutless\".DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
