          "content": "A court battle over the estate of the former prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre looks set to drag on, as the parties wrangle over who should be part of the case.Ms Giuffre, 41, who settled a sexual assault lawsuit against former Duke of York Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, was found dead in April at her farm in Western Australia without a valid will.Her sons, Christian and Noah Giuffre, launched a legal case in the WA Supreme Court in June amid speculation their mother&#x27;s estate could be worth more than $20 million.READ MORE: Almost 100 soldiers injured after group photo goes wrong Court documents previously released to the media made no mention of the millions of dollars she reportedly received in legal settlements, with the value of Ms Giuffre&#x27;s estate estimated to \"at least ... exceed the sum of $472,000\".Christian and Noah&#x27;s statement of claim says their mother owned a horse, two cars, the contents of a country home, jewellery, personal effects, shares in a company named Witty River Pty Ltd and a slice of a family trust.She also had the potential right to receive royalties from her memoir Nobody&#x27;s Girl about the abuse to which she was allegedly subjected by disgraced financier Epstein, his friend and associate Ghislaine Maxwell and the former prince when she was 17.Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied the allegations.Ms Giuffre&#x27;s former lawyer, Karrie Jean Louden, and housekeeper and carer Cheryl Mary Myers are named as defendants.Their counterclaim said the estate was worth at least $501,000.The case returned to court in Perth on Friday when lawyers for the parties put different views forward about whether and how Ms Giuffre&#x27;s daughter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and her ex-husband Robert Giuffre should or could join the case as plaintiffs.Registrar Danielle Davies said the matter should be decided by a judge or master and referred the issue to the court for a hearing.Outside the court, defence lawyer Craig Hollett ran a media pack through the day&#x27;s hearing, saying it was \"about whether the right parties have been joined\" to the case.\"In these kinds of proceedings, it is important that all necessary parties are joined so that they have the opportunity to be heard to ventilate any issues, and so that the court can make a decision which represents all of the parties&#x27; interests,\" he said.At Christian and Noah&#x27;s request, the court previously appointed an administrator who has been empowered to manage Ms Giuffre&#x27;s estate.Lawyer Ian Blatchford will represent Ms Giuffre&#x27;s estate in any ongoing legal cases involving her, including in the United States.Mr Blatchford will also take charge of Ms Giuffre&#x27;s interests regarding her memoir.Ms Giuffre figured prominently in the downfall of Epstein, who was found dead in his New York jail cell in August 2019 while he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.When confirming Ms Giuffre&#x27;s death in April, Ms Louden said she was honoured to have worked with someone who was \"so strong and powerful and willing to advocate for victims of sexual abuse\".A further case management hearing over the estate will be held on May 1.Support is available from the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service at 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732)Readers seeking support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

Taylor has been characterised during his career as someone who fights for conservative Liberal values, including championing the free market and the traditional family unit.Frontbencher James Paterson – who resigned in solidarity with Taylor this week – has described him as \"the smartest policy brain in the shadow cabinet\".During his first speech as Liberal leader, Taylor flagged a hardline stance on immigration and taxes.He said the standards for migrants entering Australia have been \"too low\", before telling voters it was a \"mistake\" not to offer tax cuts last election.\"We need to be the party of lower taxes, including lower personal income taxes,\" he said.Social media faux pas One of the lingering legacies of Taylor&#x27;s political career so far is, of course, his social media blunder during the 2019 federal election.The then-energy minister was caught red-handed congratulating himself on his own social media post about adding 1000 extra carparks in his electorate.\"Fantastic. Great move. Well done Angus,\" he wrote in a Facebook comment, posted from his own Angus Taylor MP profile.The seven-year-old gaffe has come back to haunt Taylor following the leadership spill.Taylor&#x27;s latest posts on Facebook, Instagram and X have been flooded with the same comment.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
