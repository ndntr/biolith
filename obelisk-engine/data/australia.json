You smothered her at the same time you strangled her,\" he said.\"All this happened because you became angry ... you sought to control her life.\"Marsh was sentenced to life imprisonment.He will be eligible for parole in under 16 years due to time already served in custody.Support is available by 1800 RESPECT on 1800 737 732, Lifeline on 13 11 14 or Men&#x27;s Referral Service on 1300 766 491.
