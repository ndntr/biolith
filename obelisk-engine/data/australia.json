Cooke said last year&#x27;s brief mortgage stress relief may have been \"wiped away\" following today&#x27;s rate hike. Treasurer Jim Chalmers acknowledged the decision is \"difficult news\" for millions of Australians with a mortgage.\"We understand the pressure that this puts on Australian families and businesses,\" Chalmers said.\"While today&#x27;s decision was widely expected, obviously that doesn&#x27;t make it any easier.\"READ MORE: Australia rolls out world-first vaccine trial for children with aggressive brain tumoursNot everyone with a mortgage will be worse off, though. Not all borrowers decreased their repayments when rates fell last year.According to Canstar, about 80 per cent of NAB variable rate customers and the \"vast majority\" of CBA&#x27;s didn&#x27;t reduce their repayments, giving them some welcome wiggle room now.If you are on a fixed rate, your repayments will stay the same until the fixed term ends.There&#x27;s a silver lining: the rate hike means those with a savings account or term deposit will enjoy a greater return on their money.When rates are higher, savings products will generally pay more interest.When the cash rate is lowered, interest returns will generally fall.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
