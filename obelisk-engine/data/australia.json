Surfers pulled him to shore but, despite efforts to save his life, he had lost a lot of blood and died at the scene.Psillakis&#x27; wife and daughter rushed to the beach after hearing the news.

Sydneysiders are urged to avoid beaches in the area as lifeguards keep people from entering the water.Drone operators will be scanning the water for any signs of shark activity.\"Volunteers will continue to assist council and authorities to protect the public from further danger in any way we can,\" Pearce said.\"For now, please remain clear of the water at beaches in the vicinity and follow the direction of lifeguards and lifesavers.\"Authorities offered their condolences to the victim&#x27;s family and the wider community. \"There has been a tragic loss of life on one of our beaches, and our deepest condolences today are with the man&#x27;s family and friends,\" Northern Beaches Council said.\"Our deepest condolences go to the family of the man involved in this terrible tragedy,\" Surf Life Saving NSW chief executive Steve Pearce said.\"The NSW government&#x27;s thoughts are with the bite victim, their family and the first responders,\" a spokesperson for the Department of Primary Industries said.READ MORE: Fire destroys heritage wedding venue in Sydney&#x27;s north-westShark attacks in Sydney are incredibly rare, with only one recorded fatality in the past 60 years.Diving instructor Simon Nellist was killed while swimming off Little Bay Beach in the city&#x27;s south in 2022.The shark was confirmed later to be a great white.Before that, the last fatal shark attack in Sydney was in 1963, when well-known actress Marcia Hathaway was fatally mauled by a bull shark while standing in 30cm of water in Middle Harbour.READ MORE: Sharyce looks perfectly healthy but hasn&#x27;t been able to work in yearsShark nets came up for the season across 51 beaches between Newcastle and Wollongong on Monday.

Col. Kilgore, played by Robert Duvall.Trump&#x27;s weekend post follows his repeated threats to add Chicago to the list of other Democratic-led cities he&#x27;s targeted for expanded federal enforcement.His administration is set to step up immigration enforcement in Chicago, as it did in Los Angeles, and deploy National Guard troops.In addition to sending troops to Los Angeles in June, Trump has deployed them since last month in Washington, as part of his unprecedented law enforcement takeover of the nation’s capital.He&#x27;s also suggested that Baltimore and New Orleans could get the same treatment, and on Friday even mentioned federal authorities possibly heading for Portland, Oregon, to “wipe ’em out,” meaning protesters.He could have been mistakenly describing video from demonstrations in that city years ago.READ MORE: Wealthy US family &#x27;matriarch&#x27; convicted of ex-son-in-law&#x27;s murderDetails about Trump&#x27;s promised Chicago operation have been sparse, but there&#x27;s already widespread opposition.City and state leaders have said they plan to sue the Trump administration.Pritzker, a possible 2028 presidential candidate, is also fiercely opposed to it.The president “is threatening to go to war with an American city,” Pritzker wrote on X over an image of Trump’s post.“This is not a joke. This is not normal.”He added: “Donald Trump isn’t a strongman, he’s a scared man. Illinois won’t be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.”Trump has suggested that he has nearly limitless powers when it comes to deploying the National Guard. At times he&#x27;s even touched on questions about his being a dictator.“Most people are saying, ‘If you call him a dictator, if he stops crime, he can be whatever he wants’ — I am not a dictator, by the way,” Trump said last month.He added, “Not that I don’t have — I would — the right to do anything I want to do.\"“I’m the president of the United States,\" Trump said then.“If I think our country is in danger — and it is in danger in these cities — I can do it.”DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
