He said multiple people were killed but declined to say how many, referring to the nineteen missing as \"souls\" because officials were still speaking to family.\"There&#x27;s nothing to describe. It&#x27;s gone,\" Davis said of the plant.READ MORE: Putin praises Trump after failing to win the Nobel prize The blast occurred about 7:45am, Davis said, with aerial footage by WTVF-TV showing the smouldering hilltop facility and the burnt-out shells of vehicles.People reported hearing and feeling the explosion from kilometres away. The company&#x27;s website says it makes and tests explosives at an eight-building facility that sprawls across wooded hills in the Bucksnort area, about ninety-seven kilometres southwest of Nashville.Davis said investigators are trying to determine what happened and couldn&#x27;t say what caused the explosion.There&#x27;s no further danger of explosions, and the scene was under control Friday afternoon, according to Grey Collier, a spokesperson for the Humphreys County Emergency Management Agency.Emergency crews were initially unable to enter the plant because of continuing detonations, Hickman County Advanced EMT David Stewart said by phone. He didn&#x27;t have any details on casualties.Accurate Energetic Systems, based in nearby McEwen, did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment Friday morning.\"This is a tragedy for our community,\" McEwen Mayor Brad Rachford said in an email. He referred further comment to a county official.Residents in Lobelville, a twenty-minute drive from the scene, said they felt their homes shake and some people captured the loud boom of the explosion on their home cameras.The blast rattled Gentry Stover from his sleep.\"I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it,\" he said by phone. \"I live very close to Accurate and I realised about thirty seconds after I woke up that it had to have been that.\"State Rep. Jody Barrett, a Republican from the neighbouring town of Dickson, was worried about the possible economic impact because the plant is a key employer in the area.\"We live probably 15 miles (24km) as the crow flies and we absolutely heard it at the house,\" Barrett said. \"It sounded like something going through the roof of our house.\"READ MORE: Palestinians return to what remains of their homes DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Tens of thousands of Palestinians headed back to the heavily destroyed northern Gaza Strip on Friday as a US-brokered ceasefire came into effect in a deal that raised hopes for ending the Israel-Hamas war. All the remaining hostages were set to be released within days.Questions remain over who will govern Gaza as Israeli troops gradually pull back and whether Hamas will disarm, as called for in US President Donald Trump&#x27;s ceasefire plan. Israel&#x27;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who unilaterally ended a ceasefire in March, hinted that Israel might renew its offensive if Hamas does not give up its weapons.The latest truce nevertheless marks a key step toward ending a ruinous two-year war that was triggered by Hamas&#x27; 2023 attack on Israel. The fighting has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and displaced around 90 per cent of the Gaza population of some 2 million, often multiple times. Many of them will find fields of rubble where their homes once stood.The military confirmed the start of the ceasefire on Friday, and the remaining 48 hostages, around 20 of them believed to be alive, are to be released by Monday. Palestinians said heavy shelling in parts of Gaza earlier on Friday had mostly stopped after the military&#x27;s announcement.Netanyahu said in a televised statement on Friday that the next stages would see Hamas disarm and Gaza demilitarised.\"If this is achieved the easy way — so be it. If not — it will be achieved the hard way,\" Netanyahu said. He added that Hamas agreed to the deal \"only when it felt that the sword was on its neck — and it is still on its neck.\"The Israeli military has said it will continue to operate defensively from the roughly 50 per cent of Gaza it still controls after pulling back to agreed-upon lines.Meanwhile, the United Nations was given the green light by Israel to begin delivering scaled-up aid into Gaza starting Sunday, a UN official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet made public.The aid will include 170,000 metric tons that have already been positioned in neighboring countries such as Jordan and Egypt as humanitarian officials awaited permission from Israeli forces to restart their work.In the last several months, the UN and its humanitarian partners have only been able to deliver 20 per cent of the aid needed in the Gaza Strip, according to UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher.People on the moveA steady stream of people, the vast majority on foot, crammed onto a coastal road in the central Gaza Strip, heading north to see what might remain of their homes. It was a repeat of emotional scenes from an earlier ceasefire in January. Others headed to other parts of the Palestinian territory in the south.The destruction they find this time will be even greater, after Israel waged a new offensive in Gaza City, in the north, in recent weeks. The military bombed high-rises and blew up homes in what it said was an attempt to destroy Hamas&#x27; remaining military infrastructure.Palestinians have expressed relief that the war may end, tempered with concern about the future and lingering pain from the staggering death and destruction.\"There wasn&#x27;t much joy, but the ceasefire somewhat eased the pain of death and bloodshed, and the pain of our loved ones and brothers who suffered in this war,\" said Jamal Mesbah, who was displaced from the north and plans to return.In Gaza&#x27;s southern city of Khan Younis, hundreds of Palestinians returning to their homes found wrecked buildings, rubble and destruction after Israeli troops withdrew.\"There was nothing left. Just a few clothes, pieces of wood and pots,\" said Fatma Radwan, who was displaced from Khan Younis. People were still trying to retrieve bodies from under the rubble, she added.Many buildings were flattened, and none was undamaged, as people went back to search for their belongings. \"We came to a place that is unidentifiable. An unidentifiable town. Destruction is everywhere,\" said Hani Omran, who was also displaced from Khan Younis.The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1200 people and taking 251 hostage.In Israel&#x27;s ensuing offensive, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and nearly 170,000 wounded, according to Gaza&#x27;s Health Ministry, which doesn&#x27;t differentiate between civilians and combatants but says around half the deaths were women and children.The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, and the United Nations and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.The war has also triggered other conflicts in the region, sparked worldwide protests and led to allegations of genocide that Israel denies.How the agreement is expected to unfoldIsrael is set to release around 2000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the remaining hostages. A list Israel published Friday did not include high-profile prisoner Marwan Barghouti, the most popular Palestinian leader and a potentially unifying figure. Israel views him and other high-profile prisoners as terrorists and has refused to release them in past exchanges.Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official and lead negotiator, said on Thursday evening that all women and children held in Israeli jails will be freed.The hostage and prisoner releases are expected to begin Monday, two Egyptian officials briefed on the talks and a Hamas official said, though another official said they could occur as early as Sunday night. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to be publicly named speaking about the negotiations.A relative of one of the Israeli hostages believed to have died in captivity says the family is hoping that his body will be returned for burial.\"It&#x27;s a measured sense of hope in all hostage families,&#x27;&#x27; said Stephen Brisley, whose sister, Lianne Sharabi, and her two teenage daughters were killed at Kibbutz Be-eri in southern Israel on October 7, 2023.Lianne&#x27;s husband, Eli Sharabi, was eventually released, but his brother, Yossi, is believed to have died in an air strike in January 2024. The family hopes to give him a dignified burial.\"It&#x27;s a guarded optimism because it&#x27;s the kind of optimism that&#x27;s born out of heartbreaking experience. We hold our hope lightly because we&#x27;ve had our hopes dashed before,\" Brisley told The Associated Press from his home in South Wales.\"It still feels like a long way between the announcement of the deal and actually getting Yossi&#x27;s body back to bury him.&#x27;&#x27;As part of the deal, five border crossings are expected to reopen, including the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, Egyptian and Hamas officials said. That will allow aid to flow into the territory, parts of which are experiencing famine.The Trump plan calls for Israel to maintain an open-ended military presence inside Gaza, along its border with Israel. An international force, comprised largely of troops from Arab and Muslim countries, would be responsible for security inside Gaza.To help support and monitor the ceasefire deal, US officials said they would send about 200 troops to Israel as part of a broader, international team. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not authorised for release.The US would also lead a massive internationally funded reconstruction effort.The plan also envisions an eventual role for the Palestinian Authority — something Netanyahu has long opposed. But it requires the authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, to undergo a sweeping reform program that could take years.The Trump plan is even more vague about a future Palestinian state, which Netanyahu firmly rejects.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Previously Moscow has said it has been protecting vulnerable children from a war zone.The first lady said on Friday her representative was working directly with Putin&#x27;s team to secure the safe reunification of children with their families between Russia and Ukraine.Eight children had been returned to their families within the last 24 hours, she said.\"Russia continues to cooperate with the United States in various areas, including humanitarian ones. We appreciate Melania Trump&#x27;s humanitarian leadership,\" said Russia&#x27;s presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who was involved in discussions.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday praised US President Donald Trump&#x27;s peace efforts, despite not winning a Nobel, and voiced hope for securing an agreement to extend a pivotal nuclear arms pact with Washington for another year.Asked by reporters whether he thinks Trump was unjustly passed over for the Nobel Peace Prize in favor of Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, Putin replied that he wasn&#x27;t the one to decide but extolled Trump&#x27;s efforts toward a ceasefire in Gaza and in Ukraine.\"He&#x27;s really doing a lot to resolve such complex crises that have lasted for years and even decades,\" Putin said of Trump while in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, for a summit of former Soviet nations.He added that if the Gaza ceasefire deal is carried out, it would mark a \"historic\" achievement.The Russian leader didn&#x27;t comment on Machado&#x27;s win, but he said without mentioning any names that the Nobel Committee in the past has awarded the prize to those who have accomplished little to help global peace.\"There have been cases where the committee has awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to people who have done nothing for peace,\" Putin said. \"A person comes, good or bad, and (gets it) in a month, in two months, boom. For what? He didn&#x27;t do anything at all. In my view, these decisions have done enormous damage to the prestige of this prize.\"Putin wasn&#x27;t the only one to heap praise on the US President for brokering the deal.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and UN Secretary-General António Guterres all issued similarly worded statements noting Trump&#x27;s efforts, after Israel confirmed the first phase of the deal had been ratified.\"This is a moment of profound relief that will be felt all around the world, but particularly for the hostages, their families, and for the civilian population of Gaza, who have endured unimaginable suffering over the last two years,\" Starmer noted. Guterres said \"the UN will support the full implementation of the agreement\" and they plan to \"scale up the delivery of sustained & principled humanitarian relief, and we will advance recovery & reconstruction efforts in Gaza\".&#x27;Complex issues&#x27; to resolve before ending Russia-Ukraine warTurning to the conflict in Ukraine that has dragged on for more than three-and-a-half years, Putin said he and Trump discussed ways to settle it at their summit in Alaska in August, adding that \"on the whole, we have an understanding, both on the part of the United States and on the part of the Russian Federation, about where we should move and what we should strive for in order to end this conflict.\"Putin said he told Trump in Alaska that he needed more time to think about it and discuss it with Russia&#x27;s allies.\"These are complex issues that require further analysis, but we remain committed to the discussion that took place in Anchorage,\" he said, adding that \"perhaps we can still accomplish a lot based on the agreements and discussions in Anchorage.\"He voiced hope that Moscow and Washington would agree to extend the 2010 New START arms reduction treaty for another year after it expires in February. The pact limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.When asked about Putin&#x27;s proposal in September to extend the New START agreement, Trump said Sunday it \"sounds like a good idea to me.\"Putin said on Friday that Russia and the US still have enough time to agree on its extension \"if there is a good will.\"He noted that \"if the American side decides that it doesn&#x27;t need it, it&#x27;s not critical for us at all,\" as Russia has upgraded its strategic nuclear arsenals and is preparing to field new weapons.At the same time, he warned that the pact&#x27;s demise would mean that there will be no arms control agreement left between the world&#x27;s two largest nuclear powers.\"We&#x27;re ready to negotiate if the Americans, the American side sees it as acceptable and useful,\" he said. \"If not, then no. It would be a pity, because there would be nothing left at all in terms of deterrence in the area of strategic offensive weapons.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

However, when asked by Liberal senator Andrew Bragg about the impact of the federal government&#x27;s expanded first home guarantee scheme, Bullock said it was possible it would lead to house prices going \"a little higher\" in the short-term.But as for the medium-term impacts, she said that would depend on – you guessed it – supply.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
