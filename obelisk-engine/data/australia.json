Previously unseen vision obtained by Daily Mail Australia shows Freeman, his wife Amalia and their two-year-old son barricading themselves on a bus as police tried to execute a warrant.READ MORE: US given &#x27;prior notice&#x27; hours before Israeli strike on QatarFreeman reportedly called officers \"psychopaths\" and \"Nazis\" and accused them of trespassing.In the vision, it has been reported he also told the officers to \"leave us alone\" several times. His wife was also reportedly heard asking police not to force entry into the bus.Two loud noises believed to be gunshots then rang out.The footage ended as officers are seen running for cover.Victoria Police Detective Superintendent Jason Kelly told media today the images were taken by a member of Freeman&#x27;s family.\"That footage is not Victoria Police footage, is it not body-worn, it is by a member of the family of Desmond Freeman,\" Kelly said.\"From a Victoria Police point of view, it is both distressing and disappointing\"I can only imagine the impact that has had on the family of Neal and Vadim and the colleagues that were present.\"READ MORE: Swedish health minister collapses during media conferenceReward boosts tips from the public The vision from August 26 has emerged as the manhunt for Freeman enters its 16th day.Police have confirmed there has been no official sighting of the accused gunman during this time.A $1 million bounty was offered earlier this week for anyone with information which leads to the arrest of the accused gunman, the largest ever offered in the state.Superintendent Craig Darlow today said police have been given 200 tips since the reward was announced.\"We are exploring a number of matters, out of 1000 tips, a number are sightings, but not confirmed,\" Darlow said.Detective Inspector Dean Thomas said on the weekend that he remains open to all possibilities in regards to the whereabouts of Freeman and said the reward was \"just another avenue\" in the hunt.Police have received over 1000 tips from the public so far. Police searching caves and mineshafts for Freeman The 16-day search for the accused gunman has involved mineshafts, caves, huts and properties.Police said there have been over 4000 shifts and 2000 members of Victoria Police and other crews have taken part in the manhunt so far. Of the theories about where Freeman is and if he is still alive, Darlow said \"everything is on the table\".\"Including whether he has taken his own life, if he is up in the hills secreted away, if he is able to get out, we havent closed our minds to any possibility at the moment,\" he added. \"We will leave no stone unturned, he&#x27;s killed two of our members and shot a third.\"Kelly said police are prepared to continue searching for Freeman for \"as long as it takes\". \"History sggests these types of operations take significant time,\" he said.\"We need to be present, and we need to continue the search for him.\"Vadim De Waart-Hottart&#x27;s family visit Porepunkah The family of slain officer Vadim De Waart-Hottart, 34, today arrived in Porepunkah for the first time since the shooting.Kelly said his parents visited Bright Police Station, where Waart-Hottart had been temporarily seconded, and spoke with some of their son&#x27;s police colleagues.\"The attendance today was a real boost, if you like,\" he said.\"It&#x27;s been a week of emotion for Victoria Police but I believe Vaidm&#x27;s parents&#x27; attendance will hopefully assist them.\"It&#x27;s been a very distressing time for them, very emotional.\"Readers seeking support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or beyond blue on 1300 22 4636.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
