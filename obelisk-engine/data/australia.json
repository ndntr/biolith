Helicopters were also used to drop officers at specific locations, including mine shafts which had been identified using artificial intelligence (AI) mapping.Task Force Horizon detectives returned to the home yesterday as part of a fresh two-day search for evidence.The search is expected to end today. No evidence of Gus has been uncovered at any of the search sites.There is no suggestion the sheep station is linked to Gus&#x27; disappearance. A full-scale ground and air search of the property and the surrounding area was launched after Gus went missing.Police have returned to the area multiple times. Today&#x27;s search comes after police yesterday charged Gus&#x27; 75-year-old grandparent Josie Murray with firearms offences but have maintained the charges are not linked to the toddler&#x27;s disappearance.Murray was bailed to appear in the Peterborough Magistrates Court on May 6.LATEST: NRL premiership winner identified as victim in Sydney drive-by shootingDetective Inspector Andrew Macrae said the firearms charges were not related to the disappearance of Gus or a previous incident at Oak Park Station in October involving media attending the property.Police earlier this month confirmed a person with close ties to the household, who is not one of Gus&#x27; parents, had been speaking with detectives but then allegedly \"withdrew cooperation\" and has since been identified as a suspect.Gus&#x27; disappearance is now being considered a major crime. Josie Murray and Gus&#x27; other grandparent Shannon Murray released a statement through their lawyers, saying they were \"absolutely devastated\" by SA Police&#x27;s statement on February 6.\"We are absolutely devastated by the media release of SAPOL Major Crime,\" the statement read.WORLD: Australians with alleged IS ties turned back after leaving Syrian camp\"The family has cooperated fully with the investigation and want nothing more than to find Gus and reunite him with his mum and dad.\"The lawyers also indicated they will not be making any further comments.There is no suggestion Josie or Shannon Murray are involved in the disappearance of Gus and it is not unusual for anyone linked to an investigation to seek out legal advice.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

          "content": "Coles has defended its \"down down\" discount campaign, saying grocery shoppers understand they represent \"fair dinkum\" price reductions.The retail giant today told the Federal Court the public would accept the promotions as price drops, accusing the consumer watchdog of attributing \"sophisticated thought processes\" to ordinary customers.In the second day of a high-profile trial, Coles lawyers said its \"down down\" prices were genuine discounts offered to shoppers after an increase in wholesale costs charged by suppliers during a post-COVID inflation surge in 2022 and 2023.READ MORE: Nancy Guthrie&#x27;s family cleared as suspects amid &#x27;cruel&#x27; speculationColes is fighting claims by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that it misled customers by artificially increasing prices before reducing them and claiming shoppers were getting a discount.The grocery chain&#x27;s barrister, John Sheahan KC, said there were two critical questions in the case: what the price tickets conveyed to consumers and were they misleading.\"The ordinary, reasonable consumer would not be concerned with the relative duration of the &#x27;was&#x27; price in the past,\" he said.\"What they would be concerned with when they&#x27;re walking down the aisle trying to work out what to buy today for their shopping is whether the claimed discount was … fair dinkum.\"So long as the &#x27;was&#x27; price is a genuine price, not contrived or ephemeral, then the consumer&#x27;s interest is appropriately satisfied.\"Sheahan accepted Justice Michael O&#x27;Bryan&#x27;s proposition that an ordinary consumer would consider the \"down down\" campaign to be a promotion.\"I think I can take this as general knowledge, that as you walk down an aisle in a supermarket, and you see different coloured labels, and the fact that a label hangs out lower … it&#x27;s a discount of some kind,\" Justice O&#x27;Bryan said.READ MORE: &#x27;They made a choice&#x27;: Government won&#x27;t help Australians with alleged IS tiesSheahan said the ACCC&#x27;s case was \"too complex to credibly attribute to an ordinary, reasonable consumer walking down an aisle of Coles\".It was a genuinely unusual feature of the case that the regulator was attributing \"sophisticated thought processes to the ordinary, reasonable consumer\", he added.\"Normally, it&#x27;s the advertiser says, &#x27;oh, well, you know, the consumer could see through that, they take this into account, they&#x27;d understand.&#x27; But this is the other way around.\"There are layers and layers of indeterminacy in what they attribute to the ordinary, reasonable consumers&#x27; understanding of this very simple ticket.\"Justice O&#x27;Bryan said it seemed the task for the court was to simply to conclude what was conveyed and if it was misleading.Sheahan said grocery prices often fluctuated, particularly during periods of high inflation, such as 2022 and 2023.\"In the end all prices are temporary - nothing lasts forever,\" he said.The case continues.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
