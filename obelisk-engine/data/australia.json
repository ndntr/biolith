If you don&#x27;t like it here, leave&#x27;,\" Chrysanthou said.READ MORE: NSW Nationals leader shocks fellow MPs with surprise resignationHanson&#x27;s tweet was found to have breached 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act - a clause that has survived repeated efforts by conservative politicians to strike it out.In his November 2024 findings, Justice Stewart found that migrants of colour, Australians who had recently immigrated, or Muslims who were people of colour in Australia would be insulted, offended, humiliated and intimidated by the tweet.\"It is a message that Senator Faruqi is, as an immigrant, a second-class citizen, and that she should be grateful for what she has and keep quiet,\" he said in his Federal Court ruling.The phrase \"go back to where you came from\" was a racist, anti-immigrant and nativist trope traceable to the White Australia Policy, the judge declared.The appeal hearing continues.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
