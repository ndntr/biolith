A reporter asked Trump if the reason it took nine months to organise a meeting with Albanese was because of Rudd&#x27;s previous comments. Trump said he didn&#x27;t \"know anything about\" who the reporter was referring to and asked Albanese where Rudd was and if he still worked for him.READ MORE: Teen charged over fatal bus stop stabbing in SydneyWhen Albanese pointed out Rudd sitting across from Trump at the cabinet table, Trump asked the ambassador if he \"said bad\", to which Rudd replied, \"before I took this position, Mr President\".\"I don&#x27;t like you either and I probably never will,\" Trump replied.Rudd later apologised to Trump for his previous remarks off-camera.\"All is forgiven,\" Trump is reported to have said.AUKUS and Julian Assange high points of tenure Rudd oversaw several key moments between Australia and the United States during his time as ambassador.During his posting, the AUKUS was given Trump&#x27;s backing despite concerns raised by a Pentagon review, with the US president confirming Australia will be supplied with nuclear-powered submarines.READ MORE: Trump says Iran wants to negotiate as death toll rises to at least 572The two countries also signed an $8.5 billion rare earths deal during the October state visit in an attempt to break China&#x27;s stranglehold on the industry.Rudd was also involved in returning WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to Australia in 2024. Assange, who spent five years in prison in the United Kingdom and seven more in asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London while facing the threat of extradition to the United States, was freed after a plea deal was reached in 2024, allowing him to return home.Rudd will officially finish his posting on March 31.His replacement is yet to be announced.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "standfirst": "Referencing ‘teaching or discussion’ could give exemption from legislation Labor hopes to pass next weekFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updatesGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcastPeople accused of breaching the Albanese government’s new hate speech laws could argue their conduct was legal because they were quoting from a religious text, draft legislation shows. Extracts of the draft bill obtained by Guardian Australia show it will be illegal to publicly promote or incite hatred, or disseminate ideas of superiority or hatred towards another person or group of people based on their race, colour, or national or ethnic origin.But within the draft bill is a proposed legal defence to the rule that states the legislation does not apply to an individual directly quoting a religious text. “[The offence] not apply to conduct that consists only of directly quoting from, or otherwise referencing, a religious text for the purpose of religious teaching or discussion,” the draft states. The government promised to tackle antisemitism, crack down on so-called “hate preachers” and hate speech following the alleged Bondi terror attack in December. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is expected to have more to say about the plans early on Tuesday morning. Albanese on Monday confirmed parliament would sit for two days on 19 and 20 January to rush through the new laws. Parliament had been due to return for the year on 3 February. The sitting will include condolence motions for the 15 people killed at Bondi last month. The new laws will create serious offences for hate preachers, increase penalties for hate crimes, create a new racial vilification offence, introduce a new listing for prohibited hate groups, at a lower threshold than the terror group listing, as well as introduce provisions to establish the biggest gun buyback program since the Port Arthur massacre. The legislation will also ensure offenders driven by extremism will have that motivation factored into their sentencing, strengthen existing bans on prohibited symbols, and create a new offence for inciting hatred in order to intimidate or harass. The home affairs minister will have new powers to cancel or refuse visas. Crossbenchers are due to be briefed on the legislation on Tuesday. Some privately expressed concerns the major parties would use the secretive intelligence and security committee to limit genuine consultation on the plan. Labor and the Coalition shut out crossbench and independent members from serving on the committee. The attorney general, Michelle Rowland, said the laws would be “the toughest hate laws Australia has ever seen”. Continue reading...",

The Director of Public Prosecutions may also grant indemnity to anybody who provides information about the perpetrator.Anyone with information about the disappearance of Eloise Worledge is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or online.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
