          "content": "The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) has officially declared a weather system in the Coral Sea as a cyclone.Tropical Cyclone Koji has strengthened to a Category 2 storm and is forecast to cross the Queensland coast, near Ayr, north of Bowen, on Sunday morning.Koji, which has gusts of up to 130km/h is currently 230 kilometres east of Innisfail and 265 kilometres north-northeast of Townsville. LIVE UPDATES: Water in bushfire-ravaged town &#x27;not safe to drink&#x27;, authorities warnThe slow-moving system could still pick up more strength while out at sea, as it tracks south towards the Queensland coast at a speed of 11km/h. The BoM&#x27;s warning zone currently extends across Innisfail to Mackay, including Townsville, Palm Island, Bowen, Proserpine and Whitsunday Islands. There are also multiple \"take shelter now\" emergency alerts in place, all the way from Townsville to Airlie Beach.Locals are being told if they have any concerns, to get themselves to evacuation shelters and facilities to keep themselves and their families safe. It&#x27;s effects have already been felt along Queensland&#x27;s coastline with choppy surf and palm trees resembling rag dolls as they flop back and forth in the wind.The bureau warns of gales with damaging wind gusts of up to 100km/h between Cardwell and Airlie Beach tonight, which may extend south to areas between Proserpine and Mackay during Sunday morning.Areas between Innisfail and Cardwell could experience gales as well if Koji takes a track further west, but the BoM says this is becoming less likely.Townsville Airport has already closed until the system passes over and dozens of flights into and out of Hamilton Island have been cancelled. A severe weather warning is currently in place for heavy to locally intense rainfall and damaging winds about the northeast and central Queensland coasts.Heavy rainfall which could lead to flash flooding is forecast to develop from Ingham to Proserpine tonight.Locally intense rainfall, which the BoM says \"may lead to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooring\", is possible between Townsville and Proserpine later tonight, extending south to Mackay on Sunday. Complicating management of the weather event is a serious connectivity issue affecting the Townsville area.READ MORE: NSW set to face extreme fire dangersA thief cut a telecommunications line while trying to steal copper in Deeragun.\"My message to that lowlife is you have put at risk the lives of North Queenslanders in their hour of need and you can&#x27;t get a lower act than that,\" Premier David Crisafulli said.\"And we intend to make sure that we throw the book at this individual when they are caught.\"Telecommunications are life and death.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Video captured by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent Jonathan Ross gives a raw, up-close perspective of the pivotal moments surrounding his fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis.A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official confirmed the video, obtained by CNN, was recorded on the agent&#x27;s cellphone camera; the video was originally obtained by the conservative Minnesota media outlet Alpha News.Vice President JD Vance shared it, saying it shows the officer was endangered.READ MORE: FBI won&#x27;t co-operate with state investigators in ICE shooting case \"Watch this, as hard as it is. Many of you have been told this law enforcement officer wasn&#x27;t hit by a car, wasn&#x27;t being harassed, and murdered an innocent woman. The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self-defence,\" Vance posted on X.The video begins with Ross in front of the vehicle driven by Good, who had stopped her burgundy SUV perpendicular to the street, obstructing the flow of traffic. Ross does not say anything as he walks across the front of the car toward the driver&#x27;s side of the car.As he rounds the car, Good can be seen with her window down looking directly at the officer.In the video, Good then talks to Ross.\"That&#x27;s fine dude. I&#x27;m not mad at you,\" she says. Ross does not respond. In the car window a reflection can be seen of Ross, holding his phone up, as he continues to walk. You can also hear the victim&#x27;s wife, Becca Good, say \"show your face\" to Ross.The video shows Ross walking around to the back of the car. Becca Good, the passenger in the car, who had gotten out of the vehicle prior to the confrontation, tells Ross that, \"We don&#x27;t change our plates every morning, just so you know. This will be the same plate when you come talk to us later.\"She holds a mobile phone up to Ross&#x27;s face as she addresses Ross.READ MORE: Video shows how Minnesota ICE shooting unfolded\"You wanna come at us? You wanna come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy,\" she says to Ross. She then tries to get back in the car, but the door is locked.You then hear another officer tell Good, the driver, to \"get out of the fucking car.\"Good is then seen reversing the car and glancing forward as she turns the steering wheel to the right, away from where the officer is standing. The car moves forward, and Ross cries out \"whoa\" and then three gunshots are heard in rapid succession.The video does not show if the SUV made contact with Ross, as the camera angle jerks up to the sky. An earlier video shot by a bystander shows that the SUV may have made contact with Ross as it lurches forward, and he moves to the side.DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the newly released video backs up what the agency has said – that the ICE agent acted in self-defence.READ MORE: US federal immigration agents shoot two people in car \"This footage corroborates what DHS has stated all along – that this individual was impeding law enforcement and weaponised her vehicle in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to federal law enforcement. The officer was in fear of his own life, the lives of his fellow officers and acted in self-defence. The American people can watch this video with their own eyes and ears and judge for themselves,\" McLaughlin said in a statement on Friday.The shooting itself is not visible, but three gunshots are heard as the phone in his hand jostles further and then is facing the house behind Ross.The camera then captures the SUV as it barrels forward. Someone can be heard uttering \"f—ing bitch\".The impact of the SUV crashing into a parked car can be heard as well as the camera pans down to the street.READ MORE: Was an ICE officer allowed to open fire at a driver?
