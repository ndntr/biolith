His mother previously told the coroner she missed her son dearly and thought about him every day.\"I may never be able to hold him again but he was and will always be an integral part of my life,\" she said.Mammalian meat allergy is also known as alpha-gal syndrome.In Australia, almost all cases are induced by bites of the eastern paralysis tick, which is endemic throughout the eastern coastal regions of Australia.Van Nunen has diagnosed and managed more than 800 patients with mammalian meat allergy in the last 20 years.She told the coroner&#x27;s court that a tick causes the allergy by injecting an allergen into the body which cause the body to manufacture alpha-gal allergy antibody.That antibody causes the body to become sensitised to a molecule known as alpha-gal that is found in most mammals including cows, pigs, sheep and kangaroos.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
