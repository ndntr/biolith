          "content": "More than 20 people have been injured and aftershock warnings have been issued after a powerful 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck off the northern coast of Japan, triggering a tsunami alert.The quake struck about 11.15pm (1.15am on Tuesday AEDT) in the Pacific Ocean about 80 kilometres off the coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture of Japan&#x27;s main Honshu island, the Japanese Meteorological Agency said.The JMA initially reported the quake as magnitude 7.6 before revising that down.READ MORE: Days after chilling beach find, dad leaves wife and kids to flee A tsunami of 70 centimetres was measured in Kuji port in Iwate prefecture, just south of Aomori, and tsunami levels of up to 50 centimetres struck other coastal communities in the region, the agency said.It issued an alert for potential tsunami surges of up to three metres in some areas, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara urged residents to immediately head to higher ground or take shelter inside buildings or evacuation centres until the alert is lifted.After several hours, the JMA downgraded the warning to a tsunami advisory.The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said 23 people were injured, including one seriously.Most of the victims were hit by falling objects, NHK reported, adding that several people were injured in a hotel in Hachinohe and a man in Tohoku was slightly hurt when his car fell into a hole.A CNN team in Japan&#x27;s capital Tokyo reported feeling strong tremors during the earthquake, which lasted for longer than 30 seconds.Kihara said nuclear power plants in the region were conducting safety checks and that so far no problems had been detected.He later told reporters that Shinkansen bullet trains and some local lines were suspended in parts of the region.About 800 homes were without electricity, he said.The meteorological agency issued a caution about possible aftershocks in the coming days. It said there is a slight increase in risk of a magnitude 8-level quake and possible tsunami occurring along Japan&#x27;s northeastern coast from Chiba, just east of Tokyo, to Hokkaido. The agency urged residents in 182 municipalities in the area to monitor their emergency preparedness in the coming week.Several cases of fires were reported in Aomori, and about 90,000 residents were advised to take shelter at evacuation centres, the Fire and Disaster Management Agency said.READ MORE: Police searching for mum and son in Western AustraliaSatoshi Kato, a vice principal of a public high school in Hachinohe, told NHK that he was at home when the quake struck, and that glasses and bowls fell and smashed into shards on the floor.Kato said he drove to the school because it was designated an evacuation centre, and on the way he encountered traffic jams and car accidents as panicked people tried to flee. Nobody had yet come to the school to take shelter, he said.Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, in a brief comment to reporters, said the government set up an emergency task force to urgently assess the extent of damage.\"We are putting people&#x27;s lives first and doing everything we can,\" she said.The quake struck about 80 kilometres north-east of Hachinohe, and about 50 kilometres below the sea surface, the meteorological agency said.It was just north of the Japanese coast that suffered the magnitude 9.0 quake and tsunami in 2011 that killed nearly 20,000 people.Japan is no stranger to severe earthquakes. It lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an area of intense seismic and volcanic activity on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. The worst quake in recent Japanese history was the 9.1-magnitude Tohoku earthquake in 2011 that triggered a major tsunami and nuclear disaster.- Reported with Associated Press and CNNSign up here to receive our daily newsletters and breaking news alerts, sent straight to your inbox.",
