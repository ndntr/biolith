READ MORE: Hundreds flee homes as Victoria bushfire breaks containmentThe exclusion zone that was recently imposed in Melbourne&#x27;s CBD, also following the Bondi attack, will not be in place today.\"There will be a highly visible police presence throughout the CBD, with a number of traffic management points in place,\" Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Bob Hill told 9news.com.au.He said police had been engaging \"constructively\" with protest organisers. Sydney march kicks off in Hyde Park Hundreds of people have gathered in Sydney&#x27;s Hyde Park to march for Indigenous sovereignty.There is a heavy police presence, including members of the riot squad, at the Invasion Day protest, which kicked off about 10am today.The rally began with a moving tribute to Sophie Quinn, an Indigenous woman who was allegedly shot dead by her former partner in Lake Cargelligo in NSW last week.Quinn&#x27;s aunt Neruda and her friend John Harris were also killed in the shooting. Protesters at today&#x27;s rally are holding signs that read \"Stop killing us\" and \"sovereignty never ceded\".Members of the Palestine Action Group are also in attendance in Hyde Park.An March for Australia demonstration is under way in Sydney too.The protesters began walking along Cleveland Street and are heading for Moore Park in the CBD.Tensions have flared between opposing groups and a heavy police presence is on the ground.One protester was seen carrying a sign that called to \"free Joel Davis\", the neo-Nazi leader who is accused of allegedly urging followers to \"rhetorically rape\" Wentworth MP Allegra Spender.A brief scuffle broke out between Invasion Day demonstrators and a group of men with Australian flags, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

A March for Australia rally is also underway in Melbourne&#x27;s CBD. Police are on the ground monitoring the protest as crowds flood the streets around Parliament House.Some demonstrators could be heard chanting \"always was, always will be, Aboriginal land\".9News captured footage of a confrontation between opposing protesters near the steps of parliament .One woman was knocked to the ground during the scuffle.March for Australia protesters in CanberraMeanwhile, in Canberra, an opposing March for Australia protest is taking place outside Parliament House.The Australian Federal Police is out in full force as protesters wave Australian flags and march towards Lennox Gardens in Yarralumla.An Invasion Day protest also began at 10am in Canberra and is expected to finish at Old Parliament House.ACT Police warned the protests could cause traffic disruptions in the capital today. &#x27;Zero tolerance&#x27; for hate speech , violenceNSW Premier Chris Minns said police are on high alert today for any protesters who violate federal legislation during the marches in Sydney today.\"There will be no tolerance for violence or hate speech on Sydney streets,\" Minns said.\"We live in a beautiful multicultural community with people from around the world, but we will not tolerate a situation where, on Australia&#x27;s national day, it&#x27;s been pulled down by divisive language, hate speech or racism.\"Minns said he was confident protesters would respect exclusion zones and that police had been liaising with organisers for weeks to ensure today goes ahead without incident.When asked about his plans to tighten protest laws further in NSW, the premier said he had not ruled out introducing stricter legislation.\"I do believe we have to confront this idea that the centre of Sydney can be dominated weekend after weekend after weekend by the same protest,\" he said.\"People have got a right to protest, but other Australians have a right to enjoy the city.\"My responsibility is to keep the people of NSW safe, and to balance those rights.\"He said the state government would also look at changing the scope of hate slogan laws in the wake of federal laws, which were passed in parliament last week. Recent polls, including from Resolve and Roy Morgan, indicate that support for keeping Australia Day on January 26 is rising.Roy Morgan found that 72 per cent of respondents agreed Australia Day should retain its current name and date, compared to 28 per cent who disagreed.READ MORE: Our first astronaut&#x27;s moving Australian of the Year message \"This is the highest support for Australia Day recorded by Roy Morgan,\" chief executive Michele Levine said.\"There is majority support for Australia Day retaining its name and date across all age groups, genders, and all states. \"However, there remains a political divide, with most Labor and Greens voters saying the date should be changed, while Liberal, National, and One Nation voters hugely supported it.",

We&#x27;re even encouraged away.\"So if I may be allowed another dream beyond being an astronaut, it&#x27;s this that we bring that same \"give it a go\" spirit from the sports field to the STEM fields, backing each other and ourselves with the trust that we can do hard, important things. \"Imagine what more we would discover, what great problems we would solve, how our horizons would expand.\"YOUNG AUSTRALIAN OF THE YEAR Nedd Brockman was named Young Australian of the Year for 2026 after capturing the nation&#x27;s hearts and minds with an almost 4000-kilometre run across Australia on his mission to end homelessness.After the 23-year-old electrician spent 46 days running from Perth&#x27;s Cottesloe Beach to Bondi Beach in 2022, raising $2.6 million, he&#x27;s shown no signs of slowing down.Later, he ran 1000 miles (1600 kilometres) around Sydney Olympic Park, a gruelling feat he joked probably shaved about 20 years off his live.READ MORE: K&#x27;gari pack of dingoes to be euthanisedSince starting Nedd&#x27;s Uncomfortable Challenge in 2024, Brockmann and his team have raised more than $8 million for those experiencing homelessness.Admitting that he was a \"blubbering mess\", Brockmann called out singer John Farnham&#x27;s 1987 Australian of the Year acceptance speech, in which he spoke about the importance of making sure our national pride encompasses humanity.\"Ever the eternal optimist, I think I see a bit of what I hope for in those words myself,\" Brockmann said tonight.\"We should be proud of this amazing country. We are so lucky to call it home. \"But unfortunately, not everyone feels that way in a country as prosperous as Australia, why is it that 122,000 Australians sleep rough every night? \"That number should stop us all in our tracks.\"READ MORE: Fire doubles in size as state endures once in 20-year heatwave2026 SENIOR AUSTRALIAN OF THE YEAR A psychiatrist whose father&#x27;s Alzheimer&#x27;s disease diagnosis kickstarted a life dedicated to fighting dementia was recognised with the Senior Australian of the Year award.Professor Henry Brodaty AO dementia treatment research revolutionised his own field along with the lives of many people living with the disease and their families.His Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing, founded in 2012, has led internationally significant research and his Maintain Your Brain trial showed what a major difference simple preventions could make.\"Almost half the cost of dementia is caused by preventable factors that we can modify in our lifestyle,\" he said tonight.\"Now, our randomised control trial of an intensive online lifestyle coaching program had the best results yet in the world in maintaining cognition.\"We did a cost benefit analysis. The program paid for itself in reducing health costs, we designed this a decade ago. We can do better. We can do a lot better.\"Brodaty dedicated the award to all older Australians, especially those and their families affected by dementia. \"Oer four decades, we have moved from hopelessness to hope, from stigma to science and I&#x27;m proud to have been part of this transformation,\" he said.\"There is so much we can do. There&#x27;s so much we must do.\"2026 AUSTRALIAN LOCAL HERO Indigenous business owner Frank Mitchell was crowned Australia&#x27;s Local Hero in the first award of the night.The proud Whadjuk-Yued Noongar knew it was a huge opportunity when he was offered an electrical apprenticeship as a young, single father who&#x27;d been affected by suicide but wasn&#x27;t sure if he could complete it.When he started his own business in 2015, he pledged to offer the same opportunities to fellow Indigenous people.Wilco Electrical started with eight staff and $1.5 million turnover, created more than 70 Indigenous upskilling positions and awarded more than $11 million to indigenous subcontractors. His four companies now employ more than 200 full-time staff.\"I used to advocate for organisations to simply give Mob a job, but I know now opportunity alone is not enough,\" he said.\"If workplaces are not not culturally safe, Mob may survive, but they are unlikely to thrive.\"Wilco, Kardan, Baldja and Bilyaa are places where Mob are given a chance to feel safe, and it still does not always work, because people&#x27;s lives are complex, and there is no one size fits all approach, but when it does work, the impacts are powerful.\"That&#x27;s what I represent standing here before you today. And I am just one success story among many.\"READ MORE: Police respond to potential sighting of accused triple murderer2026 AUSTRALIAN OF THE YEAR NOMINEESAustralian Capital Territory - Professor Rose McGready (Thailand)Professor Rose McGready, 61, has spent three decades providing health services to displaced people in the border region between Thailand and Myanmar.Arriving as a young doctor, Rose discovered that refugees who had fled persecution in Myanmar had difficulty accessing medical assistance in Thailand. In response, Rose established training for local staff to focus on services for expectant mothers and in the critical period of childbirth. Over the past 31 years, she has built a network of locally run clinics and out-patient services which have saved thousands of lives.Rose&#x27;s research has also led to new treatments being developed to tackle maternal malaria. Her findings have been adopted by the World Health Organisation as the global standard for combatting the disease, helping to treat millions of women around the world.Rose&#x27;s commitment, compassion and clinical expertise provide life-saving aid to some of the most vulnerable communities in the world. New South Wales - Dr Alison Thompson OAM (Sutherland Shire)Dr Alison Thompson has deployed over 30,000 volunteers to the world&#x27;s worst disaster zones - bringing humanitarian assistance and medical aid to over 18 million people.It started on September 11, 2001, when as an investment banker, Alison rushed to New York&#x27;s World Trade Centre with her first aid kit. She stayed nine months, offering disaster relief arm-in-arm with ordinary, like-minded people.Galvanising grassroots momentum, Alison founded Third Wave Volunteers - a global movement of first responder volunteers who bring relief to the world&#x27;s disaster and war zones, including Ukraine, Syria, Afghanistan, and Sri Lanka. Following the 2004 tsunami, she set up the first Tsunami Early-Warning Centre and education museum, which continues to thrive.By mobilising everyday people, 61-year-old Alison is building resilience in local communities through sustainable, locally driven disaster prevention and recovery. Drawing from her upbringing as a pastor&#x27;s child, Alison believes that each person&#x27;s small skills add up to drive big changes.Northern Territory - Dr Felix Ho ASM (Darwin)Dr Felix Ho tirelessly serves remote communities in the Northern Territory as a medical practitioner. But for Felix, that&#x27;s not enough – he also volunteers thousands of his hours building the St John Youth Program and helps at public events as a St John first responder.Since joining as a St John cadet in 1995 at the age of 13, Felix has faithfully served others, including overseas as an Intensive Care Paramedic on a United Nations mission to Timor-Leste.In 2020, he took on national leadership of the youth portfolio for St John Ambulance Australia, where he&#x27;s a guiding force for over 3,000 young people, equipping the next generation of first responders. Aligned with clinical standards, Felix developed interactive, accessible and engaging training for youth and cadets across Australia.Now 43, Felix brings people together across geography and generations, to equip Australia&#x27;s youth to save lives through first aid in an emergency.Queensland - Dr Rolf Gomes (Kenmore Hills)When Dr Rolf Gomes, 52, was confronted with how differently cardiac patients were treated in rural and remote Australia, he decided to do something about it. He designed and launched the first Heart of Australia mobile &#x27;Heart Trucks&#x27; to visit remote communities.Today the Heart Trucks bring regular specialist clinics to over 30 towns in rural Australia, providing early diagnostic services that would otherwise be out of reach. Since 2014, the trucks have treated more than 20,000 patients and saved countless lives. The truck fleet will expand to 11 trucks by 2027 to provide services nationally, adding new diagnostic services for a wide range of early intervention health screenings, including for lung cancer.Rolf&#x27;s vision, ingenuity and tenacity have had a far-reaching impact on rural health and medicine in Australia, helping to save lives and ensure that rural patients have access to clinical services without having to travel long distances.South Australia - Katherine Bennell-Pegg (West Beach)Katherine Bennell-Pegg is making history as the first Australian to qualify as an astronaut under Australia&#x27;s space program, opening pathways for others to follow.Katherine graduated from Basic Astronaut Training in 2024 as part of a class of six trained by the European Astronaut Centre in Germany – the first international candidate to do so. She was initially chosen for the program from a field of over 22,500 applicants.Katherine has harboured ambitions of becoming an astronaut since she was a young child. As a space engineer, she has advanced multiple space missions and technologies.Alongside her career achievements, Katherine is an energetic champion for Australia&#x27;s space program, regularly presenting to audiences of schoolchildren and industry leaders to inspire the next generation and create new opportunities.Katherine, 41, is a genuine trailblazer in Australia&#x27;s emerging space industry. With her determination and drive to succeed, she is a powerful example for young Australians.Tasmania - Dr Jorian (Jo) Kippax (Ridgeway)Dr Jo Kippax was part of a specialist team of rescuers tasked to free a whitewater rafter who was trapped in perilous rapids on the Franklin River in 2024.Lithuanian whitewater rafter, Valdas Bieliauskas, was retrieved from freezing water by Jo and his team.The clinical team performed an operation to amputate Valdas&#x27;s leg underwater, allowing him to be freed and ultimately saving his life. Throughout the rescue, Jo was instrumental in guiding the team with professionalism, courage and remarkable calmness under pressure.For this life-saving act, the President of Lithuania, Gitanas Nausėda awarded the country&#x27;s Life Saving Cross award to Jo, which he humbly accepted on behalf of his team.The rescue of Valdas is just one chapter in Jo&#x27;s long career in emergency medicine, disaster response, and search and rescue. Demonstrating outstanding skill, courage and team leadership in the aid of others, 55-year-old Jo displays selfless dedication to saving lives in often very challenging circumstances.Victoria - Carrie Bickmore OAM (Melbourne)Carrie Bickmore is a radio and television presenter who has changed the way that brain cancer research is funded in Australia.Brain cancer kills more Australian children than any other disease, and more people aged under 40 than any other cancer – including Carrie&#x27;s late husband Greg, who passed away in 2010.Since 2015, Carrie has raised over $27 million. In 2021, she established The Brain Cancer Centre to bring together the brightest minds in research to find a cure.The Brain Cancer Centre has leveraged investment by Carrie&#x27;s Foundation to secure another $45 million of research funding.
