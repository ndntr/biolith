No further detail about the tennis ball bomb was provided.Police also claimed a box-like bomb was found in the boot of the car while two hand-painted Islamic State flags were also found in the car.Further weaponry and explosive devices were discovered by police in the Campsie rental, including a 3D-printed shotgun speed loader, a firearm scope, two more guns and another suspected bomb.Police allege the men left behind videos that indicated their adherence to religiously motivated violent extremism.Footage recorded in late October - six to eight weeks before the attack - and shown in the fact sheet showed each Akram training with long-arm guns and \"moving in a tactical manner\" in a countryside location.Police suspect the area was in NSW.\"The (younger Akram) is recorded appearing to recite, in Arabic, a passage from the Quran,\" the facts sheet states.\"Following the recitation, both the accused and S.AKRAM speak in English and make a number of statement sregarding their motivation for the &#x27;Bondi attack&#x27; and condemning the acts of &#x27;Zionists&#x27;.(sic)\"Further footage captured by security cameras at Bondi Beach appears to show the Akrams scoped out the area about 48 hours before their attack.\"There is evidence that the accused and his father ... meticulously planned this terrorist attack for many months,\" the facts sheet says.READ MORE: NSW gun laws to be &#x27;toughest in country&#x27; As well as releasing the police allegations, Deputy Chief Magistrate Michael Antrum today suppressed the identities of 25 survivors, to protect their privacy and assist their recovery.The court order allows victim-survivors to choose if and when they go public with their story, and join other survivors such as Arsen Ostrovsky and hero tobacconist Ahmed Al Ahmed.Akram remains in custody and was today transferred from hospital to a NSW prison under police guard.His case is next due in court in April.",

The report also found that Australians pay between four and seven times more for gas than other large, gas-producing nations, including the US, Russia, Qatar, and Canada. The federal government commissioned a six-month review of the market earlier this year as the country faced a looming gas shortage.The scheme will be designed in consultation with the industry, international partners and the community next year.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Thousands of people have gathered at Bondi Beach tonight to mark one week on from the terror attack that killed 15 innocent people.A minute&#x27;s silence was held at 6.47pm (AEDT), marking the exact time that the first gunshots rang out.A beam of light was projected into the sky above the Bondi Pavillion and the candles of a menorah were lit in tribute to those killed. Michael, the father of the youngest victim, 10-year-old Matilda, lit the final candle.READ MORE: Bondi tributes to be cleared as Australia marks one week since tragedy NSW Premier Chris Minns, wearing a kippah, said Bondi Beach had been \"reclaimed\" by having the vigil attended by so many.\"My heart is heavy for the lives that were taken here,\" he said.\"I want to say this clearly and sincerely: we are deeply sorry. With humility I acknowledge the government and its highest duty is to protect the citizens and we did not do that one week ago.\"That reality weighs on me heavily.\"We must accept that responsibility and use that to do everything and anything we possibly can to stop it from happening again.\"Minns said the massacre was an attempt \"to marginalise and scatter, to intimidate and cause fear\".\"But you have stood up to this intimidation for thousands of years. Tonight, thanks to the Jewish community of Australia on this last night of Chanukah, you have reclaimed Bondi Beach for us.\"Though the attack targeted Jewish people, Minns said the pain was felt by all Australians.\"The sad truth is this crime has tragically highlighted a deep vein of antisemitic hate in our community. To excuse it as an aberration or a tragic single event is wrong.\"As the late chief rabbi once said, the Jewish cannot fight antisemitism alone, the victim cannot fight the crime, the hated cannot cure the hate. We cannot let the Jewish people carry this burden by themselves, it is Australia&#x27;s responsibility.\"Emotions run high as PM booed The vigil began with a candle being lit and prayers said by rabbis, both in Hebrew and English.Australian Jewish musician Ben Adler sang the national anthem and as the sun set over the iconic beach, musicians performed an evocative piece of music to accompany a montage of images showing flowers left at the scene and tributes to the victims.All 15 names of the innocent people killed in the attack were listed on large screens.READ MORE: Anthony Albanese orders review into law enforcement and intelligence agenciesNSW Jewish Board of Deputies president David Ossip thanked the crowd for being there \"in solidarity with the NSW Jewish community\".As he welcomed political leaders by name, there were boos from the crowd for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.For Minns there was a standing ovation as Ossip highlighted that the NSW premier had not missed a single funeral for the victims.There was also similar applause for NSW Opposition Leader Kellie Sloane, who had gone to Bondi Beach on the night of the attacks to help victims.\"That is bravery, that is courage,\" Ossip said.He said the families \"of those who were so cruelly murdered at this place\" were also present.READ MORE: NSW Premier announces new hate laws\"Your courage and your resilience inspire us, and we are sending our love and our prayers to you at this time.\"The crowd again stood and applauded in celebration of Ahmed al Ahmed, the hero who disarmed one of the gunmen. Ahmed&#x27;s father attended the vigil in his son&#x27;s honour.\"Ahmed has asked me to pass on the following message to us all: &#x27;the Lord is close to the broken hearted. Today I stand with you, my brothers and sisters&#x27;,\" Ossip said.Ossip said more needed to be done, and there was loud cheering as he said \"it cannot be disputed that we need a royal commission, which goes beyond NSW, to get to the bottom of how this catastrophe took place\".\"We feared and suspected that this moment was coming.\"In a more just world, \"we wouldn&#x27;t be gathered here this evening\", he said.\"We&#x27;d be at home with our loved ones having a barbecue or a swim, talking about the Ashes or out and about enjoying a summer&#x27;s evening at a time of year which so many of us treasure, which is traditionally characterised by joy.\"In a more just world, small children wouldn&#x27;t have had to say goodbye to their parents this week, wives had to say goodbye to their husbands or the parents of 10-year-old Matilda to their beloved daughter.\"&#x27;I tried my best to help&#x27; NSW Opposition Leader Kellie Sloane shared her harrowing story of witnessing the \"absolute devastation\" after arriving at Bondi while the attack was still taking place.She said she held the \"hands of those who needed their hands held\".She said what she saw \"will haunt me forever.\"\"I saw police running into this scene fast and unhesitating, with guns drawn, headed into danger.\"The final pop, pop, pop of gunfire.\"And I tried my best to help. A surf lifesaver told me, &#x27;grab bandages&#x27;. I said, &#x27;what do I do?&#x27; And he said, &#x27;plug the holes&#x27;.\"I ended up sitting next to people and holding their hands, putting blankets over people who we couldn&#x27;t help anymore.\"I had people fall into my arms who were grief stricken because they felt that they hadn&#x27;t done enough, and we all felt that way.\"But, man, I saw them as heroes, and they were heroes. And there was nothing more any of us could do.\"Thousands thanked for returning to scene of terror Governor-General Sam Mostyn, King Charles III&#x27;s representative in Australia, said she joined all Australians in \"rejecting antisemitism\".\"You have always been a vital part of Australia&#x27;s story of success and belonging,\" she said.She thanked those involved in responding to the attack, from surf lifesavers and lifeguards to hospital staff and civilians.She thanked them for returning to the place \"which was ruptured with an act of terror, unspeakable barbarism, at exactly this time\".\"We will always remember the names of the loved ones who died here, and those who fought with courage to save lives,\" she said.Rabbi Moshe Kotlarsky said he was there to bring a message millions of Jewish people around the world: \"We are here with you, we stand with you, we cry with you, we ache with you, and we bless you with comfort, with strength, with faith and with resilience,\" he said.\"One week ago, terror came to this place. Monsters, indoctrinated with hatred, taught not to build but to destroy,\" he said.He said there were 50,000 people in the crowd.He paid tribute to his friend Rabbi Eli Schlanger, who was killed in the attack, and said the memorial would be Schlanger&#x27;s \"dream\".\"Thousands of Jews standing together as one, thousands of non-Jews showing up standing shoulder to shoulder.\"Day of high emotion It had already been a day of high emotion, with flags flying at half-mast and a banner flown over Bondi showing love for the Jewish community.Thousands gathered dressed in white for an event this afternoon outside Bondi Pavillion, organised by the National Council of Jewish Women.The all-faiths event saw multiple figures from both sides of politics attend.Inflatable balloons of bees were also seen, in memory of Matilda, the 10-year-old girl who was killed in the shooting who was affectionately known as \"Bee\". Friends and families of other victims also returned to Bondi to pay tribute to those who died.This included members of the Randwick Rugby Club, who lost one of their members Peter Meagher.\"He was a huge part of our club and we don&#x27;t want to talk much today,\" club president Brian O&#x27;Sullivan said.\"We&#x27;ve just come here to pay respects to all the victims and to lay down a couple of special memories for us.\"A light plane was flown over the beach this afternoon with a banner bearing a message of support.\"From Aus for our Jewish Community\", the message read, with a red heart.Tonight, another powerful display of solidarity will take place at Bondi.&#x27;A moment of pause&#x27; People across the country were asked to take part in the minute&#x27;s silence at 6.47pm AEDT.\"Sixty seconds carved out from the noise of daily life, dedicated to 15 Australians who should be with us today,\" Albanese said earlier.\"It will be a moment of pause to reflect and affirm that hatred and violence will never define us as Australians.\"READ MORE: &#x27;Pour petrol on the fire&#x27;: Frydenberg&#x27;s warning to Victorian premierREAD MORE: &#x27;People are burying their dead&#x27;: Premier&#x27;s strong message over planned protests\"The National Day of Reflection will be observed on the final day of Chanukah, a time traditionally associated with light, faith and resilience, making the loss felt by the Jewish community even more profound,\" Albanese said.\"The Commonwealth and state government will also work closely with the Jewish community on arrangements for a National Day of Mourning to be held in the New Year.\"This will allow families the time and space to lay their loved ones to rest and to support those still recovering.\"There had been plans for a strong police presence at the beach.NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon confirmed some officers would be carrying long-arm guns.\" You will see more officers than usual,\" he said.\"While our priority is keeping the community safe, it is equally about helping people feel safe as they come together to grieve.\"There were multiple community vigils held across the country, including a candle-lighting ceremony at Parliament House in Canberra.A total of 13 patients remained in hospital, including four in a critical but stable condition.If you have been impacted by the terror attack in Bondi, there is support available.To contact Lifeline Australia, call 13 11 14 or text 0477 13 11 14.For people under 25 years old, you can contact Kids Helpline at 1800 55 1800.Both of these are available on a 24/7 basis.If you wish to donate blood, you can find your nearest donor centre here.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
