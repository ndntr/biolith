What we saw yesterday was a very different pattern of behaviour,\" she said.\"It was violent, it was unacceptable, it&#x27;s not tolerated.\"READ MORE: Two dead after cargo plane skids off runway into sea while landing at Hong KongCheeseman and other figures in Victoria Police have called on more support and funding from the State government, but Allan insisted police had adequate resources to deal with protests and other violent incidents.\"[Police] had the resources, and also, importantly, they had the powers to deal with those protesters.\"She added she expects police to use these powers to their full effect to punish the perpetrators; so far only one person has been arrested in relation to Sunday&#x27;s protest.\"I want to thank Victoria police for the way they kept the community safe and dealt swiftly with this group of protesters who were choosing to use violence. It was unacceptable,\" she said.\"It is my expectation that the full force of the law will be brought to those who perpetrated this violence, which subsequently has been identified and are being investigated by Victoria Police.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "standfirst": "Two unedifying displays were enough to make any world leader tetchy about a date with the US president, so does the prime minister have anything to worry about?",
          "content": "When Anthony Albanese meets Donald Trump at the White House in a little under 48 hours, he&#x27;ll be hoping to avoid the wretched fate two other world leaders have suffered at the hands of the US president.Both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa were publicly ambushed after stepping into the Oval Office earlier this year.First it was Zelenskyy, who was berated by Trump and Vice-President JD Vance in February for not being grateful enough for US aid in the face of Russia&#x27;s invasion, even though Trump had recently labelled the Ukrainian president a dictator and parrotted Kremlin talking points.READ MORE: New report claims most essential workers can barely afford to rent \"This is going to be great television,\" Trump mused in front of Zelenskyy.Months later, Ramaphosa was blindsided when Trump dimmed the lights to play \"a couple of things\" purporting to be proof of a genocide against white farmers in South Africa – although the so-called evidence, including an image of burial sites in the Democratic Republic of Congo, was baseless and misleading.The unedifying displays were enough to make any world leader tetchy about a date with the US president, so does Albanese have anything to worry about?The prime minister himself insists not, saying last week that he was \"not at all\" nervous about the meeting, pointing to the \"really warm discussions\" he&#x27;s previously had with Trump.READ MORE: The grisly task that helped track down a man who murdered dozens of Aussies Certainly, the relationship between the US and Australia is better than that of the White House and Zelenskyy – who Trump clashed with as far back as 2019 – and South Africa, which has seen its aid cut and faced accusations of white genocide (which local authorities deny) by the Trump administration.But there are some sticking points between Washington and Canberra. The decision made by the federal government to join the likes of the United Kingdom, France and Canada in recognising Palestine as a state put it at odds with Trump, while the Pentagon is unhappy with Australia&#x27;s defence spending levels.Before Trump&#x27;s second term began, Australia had already committed to an increase in military spending from about 2 to 2.4 per cent of GDP by 2034 – still well short of the 3.5 per cent US War Secretary Pete Hegseth is calling for.READ MORE: Half of Aussies think it&#x27;s OK to commit this &#x27;risky&#x27; WFH breach For the government&#x27;s part, it says defence spending is actually far higher than what the raw figures suggest.\"We&#x27;re overseeing the largest increase in defence funding outside of war in the history of the country, and secondly, we&#x27;ve also been explaining that using the NATO methodology, which is the preferred methodology to compare these things, we&#x27;re already at 2.8 per cent of GDP before all our increases kick in,\" Defence Industry Minister Pat Conroy said on Thursday.\"So put that into context: that&#x27;s bigger than anyone in Europe, other than Poland and the Baltic states, it&#x27;s bigger than the United Kingdom, and it&#x27;s larger than any of the other Indo-Pacific partners.\"Albanese also holds some cards of his own: the recent defence deal with Papua New Guinea, with the potential for another with Fiji to follow, limiting Beijing&#x27;s push for greater Pacific influence; billions of dollars heading to the US under the AUKUS pact; plus Washington&#x27;s interest in a critical minerals deal to ease the reliance on China for the crucial rare earths.READ MORE: Nurses say they are forced to run risks of daily $65 fines just to get to work The latter has been touted as a potential bargaining chip to have Australia exempt from US tariffs – 50 per cent on steel and aluminium, as well as a 10 per cent baseline duty.And according to defence analyst Michael Shoebridge, there&#x27;s another factor in the prime minister&#x27;s favour: the sheer weight of other issues Trump is focusing on.\"Trump is a busy man – and when it comes to Australia, that means he&#x27;s just not that into us,\" he wrote for the Lowy Institute after the meeting was announced. \"That&#x27;s likely to mean he won&#x27;t focus as much as we fear on his Aussie visitor and the challenges and differences we&#x27;re all so worried about. \"In the world of 2025, that amounts to good news.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
