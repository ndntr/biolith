It is a shame!\" Thunberg told journalists and protesters shortly upon arriving.\"I could talk for a very, very long time about our mistreatment and abuses in our imprisonment, trust me, but that is not the story.\"Instead, Thunberg urged world leaders and ordinary citizens around the world to end their \"complicity\" with the \"genocide\" being carried out against Palestinians in Gaza.\"This action was challenging our extremely violent business as usual,\" Thunberg said. \"We cannot take our eyes away from Gaza.\"Israel&#x27;s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza&#x27;s Health Ministry, since the October 7 attacks exactly two years ago.

A third man, 57-year-old Gregory Snell from Buderim, has also been charged with torture. The men have also been charged with kidnapping, extortion and misconduct with a corpse.O&#x27;Connell said it&#x27;s believed Burow knew 26-year-old Howard, and the other accuseds were associates of his. He said police believed they knew the men&#x27;s motives for the attack, but declined to reveal them given the case is before the courts.The men appeared before the Brisbane Magistrates Court today.Burow&#x27;s family reported him missing on August 24, after he missed family events and failed to respond to text messages.READ MORE: Trump threatens no back pay for federal workers in shutdownThe investigation involved eight crime scenes across three police regions, and five vehicles and 1000 hours of CCTV were seized.The crime scenes include Lorrimer Terrace in Kelvin Grove, Kamala Drive at Lake McDonald, Black Pinch Road at Pomona, Kokoda Avenue at Bli Bli , Songbird Street at North Ipswich, Bellflower Road at Sippy Downs, Pimpimbugie Road at Maidenwell, and the D&#x27;Aguilar Highway at Benarkin.\" We covered a lot of ground, a lot of police were involved and a lot of resources, so it was a very complex investigation for us to see out,\" he said.\" Despite our grave concerns we were very hopeful that we could find Andrew alive.\"Whilst we were relieved to find him and provide answers to the family it was very devastating for all of us at the outcome.\"Our thoughts are with Andrew&#x27;s family and friends at this difficult time.\" Burow&#x27;s family today issued a statement remembering him as a \"caring and loving father\" and \"loyal and generous son\".They have requested privacy.BUROW FAMILY STATEMENT Andrew will be remembered as a caring and loving father, a loyal and generous son and brother, and someone who was always willing to give people a second chance.We will miss his enthusiasm for life, his entrepreneurial mindset, and his willingness to give ideas a go.At this point in the continuing process, we want to thank the Brisbane City Criminal Investigations Branch and Homicide Investigation Unit teams, who have worked so tirelessly, as well as the many other police units throughout the region who have supported them.Their professionalism, commitment and heartfelt care, together with their high level of skill, have brought us to this point of the journey.While terrible things can happen to good people, it&#x27;s been comforting to experience these officers&#x27; deep care and focus on a safe and just society.As a family, these are values we share, and we are indebted to everyone who has worked so tirelessly in Andrew&#x27;s name.We also thank the public for coming forward with information to the police.We encourage others to continue coming forward with any information that may help us as the process continues.
