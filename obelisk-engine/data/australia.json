(The teen) had other options for his aim of stealing car keys,\" he said.Justice Bowskill heard the teen, aged 16 at the time, had been drinking vodka and committing \"brazen thefts\" of alcohol with other teens before the attack. The teen was on bail for a violent armed robbery and admitted entering the shopping centre with the intent of stealing a car, the court was told.\"He had a black hoodie. He had a surgical mask. He was covering his face,\" Cook said.\"He moved towards (Ms White) and brandished his knife. He stabbed her. He didn&#x27;t hesitate.\"His motive was to get this car, to show off to his mates and potentially commit other crimes.\"The teen showed limited remorse and presented a lasting risk to the community, he added.But the teen&#x27;s barrister Matthew Hynes pushed for the killer to serve half of a 12-year sentence and be released before he turned 25 because the murder was not premeditated.\"He does need a long period of supervision in the community,\" he said.The teen also pleaded guilty to car theft and three counts of stealing.Justice Bowskill adjourned her sentencing decision tomorrow.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
