Addressing some of the world&#x27;s richest and most powerful people at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland on Wednesday (early Thursday AEDT), Trump called on Denmark and NATO to give him \"a piece of ice, cold and poorly located, that can play a vital role in world peace and world protection\".Trump directly addressed NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte before saying the US would not use \"excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly unstoppable\".READ MORE: Entire Nationals frontbench quits shadow cabinet\"That&#x27;s probably the biggest statement I made, because people thought I would use force,\" the US president said.\"I don&#x27;t have to use force. I don&#x27;t want to use force. I won&#x27;t use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.\"In a 70-minute speech in Davos, Trump began by listing what he considered his domestic achievements in the first year of his second term, before attacking European capitals over immigration and environmental policies. He said the continent was \"not heading in the right direction\" and claimed certain places in Europe are not even recognisable.Turning to the most controversial of his recent foreign policy moves, Trump said he had tremendous respect for the people of Greenland and Denmark but argued the US needed to control it, arguing no one else could defend it.Trump insisted his interest was not due to the abundant critical minerals buried beneath the ice.\"We need it for strategic national security and international security,\" he said.READ MORE: Top silk accused over child abuse chat\"This enormous unsecured island is actually part of North America on the northern frontier of the Western hemisphere.\"That&#x27;s our territory. It is therefore a core national security interest of the United States of America.\"NATO leaders have warned that Trump&#x27;s Greenland strategy could upend the alliance.His pledge to provoke a sweeping tariff fight to get his way left many allies warning of a rupture capable of shattering an alliance that had once seemed unshakable.\"What I&#x27;m asking for is a piece of ice, cold and poorly located that can play a vital role in world peace and world protection,\" Trump said.\"It&#x27;s a very small ask compared to what we have given them for many, many decades. \"But the problem with NATO is that we&#x27;ll be there for them 100 per cent but I&#x27;m not sure that they&#x27;d be there for us.\"READ MORE: Teacher gives birth to baby allegedly fathered by studentThe leaders of Denmark and Greenland have offered a wide array of ways for a greater US presence on the strategic island territory of 57,000 people where the US already has military bases but Trump argued you \"can&#x27;t defend it on a lease\".\"So we want a piece of ice for world protection, and they won&#x27;t give it,\" Trump said.\"We&#x27;ve never asked for anything else, and we could have kept that piece of land, and we didn&#x27;t. \"So they have a choice. You can say &#x27;yes&#x27; and we will be very appreciative, or you can say &#x27;no&#x27; and we will remember.\"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday called Trump&#x27;s planned new tariffs on eight of its countries over Greenland a \"mistake\" and questioned Trump&#x27;s trustworthiness. French President Emmanuel Macron said the EU could retaliate by deploying one of its most powerful economic tools, known colloquially as a trade \"bazooka\".The rising tensions concerning Greenland, and threats of a deepening trade war between the US and Europe, caused global investors to shudder on Tuesday, as stocks on Wall Street slumped.Trump&#x27;s arrival in the Swiss Alps community of Davos was delayed after a minor electrical issue aboard Air Force One had forced a return to Washington to switch aircraft.Billionaires and business leaders sought seats inside the forum&#x27;s Congress Hall, which had a capacity of around 1000, to hear Trump.Trump is expected to have around five bilateral meetings with foreign leaders, though further details weren&#x27;t provided. There are more than 60 other heads of state attending the forum.- Reported with Associated Press and Reuters",

Opposition Leader Sussan Ley called the mass resignation \"unnecessary\" as she fought to keep the Coalition together for the second time in less than a year.The Nationals walkout was triggered by division over the federal government&#x27;s new hate speech laws, after three Nationals senators who refused to join the Liberals in voting for the reforms were forced to hand in their resignations today.READ MORE: PM concedes hate speech and gun control laws are &#x27;not as strong&#x27; as he hoped READ MORE: Emotional scenes as parliament honours Bondi terror victims This prompted Littleproud to write a bombshell letter to Ley threatening that if she accepted the resignations, the entire Nationals shadow ministry would resign \"to take collective responsibility\".\"Opposing this bill was a party room decision. The entire National Party shadow ministry is equally bound,\" Littleproud wrote, in a letter first reported by The Sydney Morning Herald.Ley confirmed in a statement today she had accepted the resignations of senators Susan McDonald, Bridget McKenzie and Ross Cadell. Tonight, mass resignation went from a threat to reality as all remaining frontbench Nationals quit following a momentous 24 hours in Canberra, sparking a crisis within the Coalition less than a year after a short-lived split following the May electionLey called the resignations \"unnecessary\" and said she wouldn&#x27;t make any \"permanent\" changes to the shadow minister to give the junior partner \"time to reconsider these offers of resignation\".\"The Liberal Party supports the Coalition arrangements because they deliver the most effective political alliance for good government,\" she said in a statement released late tonight. \"I note that in David&#x27;s letter, he has not indicated that the Nationals are leaving the Coalition.\"But 9News chief political editor Charles Croucher said future of the Coalition appeared \"unworkable\" and it was \"unlikely\" Ley would remain in her job. The new hate speech and gun laws were passed last night after a long night of voting in the Senate.The Coalition decided to back the Albanese government&#x27;s reforms, which it had earlier threatened to derail after clamouring for a rapid response to the Bondi Beach antisemitic terror attack.But McDonald, McKenzie and Cadell broke ranks to vote against the bill in the Senate.Ley earlier said the senators had been asked to continue to serve the Coalition but from outside of the shadow cabinet.\"Yesterday, in several conversations, I made it clear to David Littleproud that members of the shadow cabinet could not vote against the shadow cabinet position,\" Ley said earlier.\"The shadow cabinet was unanimous in its endorsement to support this bill subject to several amendments that we did then secure.\"This has been acknowledged by Nationals&#x27; senators this morning.\"She asked Littleproud to put forward three replacement ministers but he opted not to.Liberal Senate leader Michaelia Cash and deputy leader Ted O&#x27;Brien remain in the shadow cabinet despite abstaining from the vote.The hate laws will create powers for authorities to designate certain organisations as \"hate groups\", allowing members and donors alike to face possible jail time.It will create new aggravated offences for religious or spiritual leaders who advocate violence, as well as penalise religious leaders who preach hate to children.The new framework will also give ministers more powers to cancel or refuse visas to those who spread hate or extremist views.The new gun laws, which were voted against by the Coalition, One Nation and United Australia Party senators but supported by the Greens, will limit the imports of guns to Australian citizens.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Prince Harry has struck a defensive tone at the start of his testimony against the publisher of the Daily Mail tabloid newspaper and left the witness box hours later on the brink of tears.After disputing that reporters used legitimate sources to publish revealing details of his life, he provided an emotional glimpse into the toll that a life in the spotlight and his battle against the British media had taken on him and his family.\"They continue to come after me, they have made my wife&#x27;s life an absolute misery,\" he said as he choked back tears in London&#x27;s High Court on Wednesday (Thursday AEDT).READ MORE: Coalition in freefall as Nationals quite shadow cabinet en masseHarry and six other prominent figures, including Elton John and actor Elizabeth Hurley, allege that Associated Newspapers Ltd invaded their privacy by engaging in a \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\" for 20 years, attorney David Sherborne said.The publisher has denied the allegations, called them preposterous and said the roughly 50 articles in question were reported with legitimate sources that included close associates willing to inform on their famous friends. It is expected to name sources during the nine-week trial.Harry says he was &#x27;paranoid beyond belief&#x27;Harry said in his 23-page witness statement that he was distressed and disturbed by the intrusion into his early life by the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday into his early life and it made him \"paranoid beyond belief\".It was Harry&#x27;s second time testifying after he bucked House of Windsor tradition and became the first senior royal to testify in a court in well over a century when he took the stand in his similar lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mirror in 2023.Harry, dressed in a dark suit, held a small Bible in his right hand in London&#x27;s High Court and swore to \"almighty God that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth\".Under the English court practice, Harry presented written testimony of his claims and after asserting it was true under oath, he was immediately put under cross-examination.After the Duke of Sussex said he preferred to be called Prince Harry, he acknowledged that his 23-page statement was authentic and accurate.Defence lawyer Antony White, in a calm and gentle tone, began to put questions to Harry to determine if the sourcing of the articles, in fact, had come from royal correspondents working their sources at official events or from friends or associates of the prince.Harry denied suggestions he was friendly with journalists who covered the royal family or that his friends gave details about him to the tabloids.\"My social circles were not leaky,\" he declared.Increasingly defensiveHis curt replies during cross-examination and efforts to explain what it&#x27;s like living under what he called \"24-hour surveillance\" eventually brought the intervention of the judge, who told him not to argue with the defence lawyer.\"You don&#x27;t have to bear the burden of arguing the case today,\" Justice Matthew Nicklin told the frustrated prince.As a soft-spoken Harry became increasingly defensive, White said: \"I am intent on you not having a bad experience with me, but it is my job to ask you these questions.\"Harry suggested that details in articles had come from eavesdropping on his phone calls or having private investigators snoop on him. He said journalist Katie Nicholl had the luxury to use the term \"unidentified source\" deceptively to hide unlawful measures of investigation.\"If you complain, they double down on you in my experience,\" he said in explaining why he had not objected to the articles at the time.For decades, Harry has had what he called an \"uneasy\" relationship with the media, but kept mum and followed the family protocol of \"never complain, never explain,\" he said.&#x27;Vicious persistent attacks&#x27;The litigation is part of Harry&#x27;s self-proclaimed mission to reform the media that he blames for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris.He also said persistent press attacks on his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, led them to leave royal life and move to the United States in 2020.He said \"vicious persistent attacks\", harassment and racist articles about Meghan, who is biracial, had inspired him to break from family tradition to finally sue the press.After cross-examination, Harry&#x27;s lawyer asked him how he felt about the way Associated Newspapers was defending the case.Despite having brought the lawsuit and pushed for a trial for accountability, Harry said it was \"fundamentally wrong to put all of us through this again\" when all he wanted was an apology.\"I have never believed that my life is open season to be commercialised by these people,\" he said.After mentioning his wife, who is not a party in the case, Harry choked up and appeared to be holding back tears as he stepped out of the witness box and walked slowly out of the courtroom.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
