Parents were urged to watch for communication from their schools.No schools were listed as closed in NSW, Victoria or Queensland.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has issued three separate recalls for play and decorative sand in the past week, including a 14-piece sand castle building set and magic sand in blue, green and pink – all sold at Kmart and Target – at the weekend.\"The products may cause a risk to health as asbestos has been detected in some samples after laboratory testing,\" ACCC Product Safety said.\" Importantly, respirable asbestos has not been detected in any of the tested samples.\"The release of respirable asbestos fibres is unlikely to occur in its current state, unless the sand is processed by mechanical means such as crushing or pulverising.\"The risk that any asbestos found, that is likely to be airborne or fine enough for inhalation, is low.\"The Kadink Decorative Sand 10g six-pack was pulled from Officeworks shelves on Friday, two days after Educational Colours issued a recall for a range of its products sold across Officeworks and other retailers over the past five years. Customers have been told to stop using the products immediately and safely dispose of them.\" Wear disposable gloves and a mask and either return in the original tub or place the sand in a heavy-duty plastic bag and double tape it securely and keep it out of reach of children,\" the recall notice said.\"Do not dispose of the products in general waste.\"Information on the disposal of asbestos waste, including disposal facilities in your state or territory can be found on The Asbestos and Silica Safety and Eradication Agency website.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
