Everything you need to knowUsually in the southern hemisphere, the polar vortex gathers strength in autumn, hits peak force in winter and weakens during spring.But in past weeks, meteorologists became alerted by an uptick in temperatures in the air above Antarctica, caused by an event known as Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW).This can pull warmer air down through the atmosphere and also disrupt the polar vortex, making it weaken and change shape.Meteorologists say if this continues, cooler air could be dragged from Antarctica by the polar jet stream towards southern Australia from late September into early October.This would bring more rain and westerly winds over parts of Tasmania, Victoria, SA and WA, while eastern Australia would experience drier-than-average conditions.Southern states would also experience unusually hotter days than the seasonal average temperatures.But the SSW also threatens to disrupt other weather patterns developing over Australia in coming weeks.Spring rainfall expected to be triggered from a negative Indian Ocean Dipole, off the country&#x27;s north-west, may not happen if the polar vortex changes.",

          "content": "A Paris court on Thursday sentenced former French President Nicolas Sarkozy to five years in prison after finding him guilty of criminal conspiracy in an alleged scheme to finance his 2007 campaign with funds from Libya.The historic ruling made Sarkozy the first former president of modern France sentenced to actual time behind bars.In a major surprise, the court ruled that the 70-year-old will be incarcerated despite his intention to appeal.READ MORE: Australian grandmother loses drug trafficking appeal in Japanese court It said the date of his imprisonment would be decided later, sparing the conservative leader the humiliation of being led from the packed courtroom in handcuffs.The court found Sarkozy guilty of criminal association in a plot from 2005 to 2007 to finance his winning campaign with funds from Libya in exchange for diplomatic favours.It cleared him of three other charges including passive corruption, illegal campaign financing and concealing the embezzlement of public funds.Sarkozy denounced the ruling.\"If they absolutely want me to sleep in prison, I will sleep in prison. But with my head held high. I am innocent. This injustice is a scandal,\" he said with his wife, the singer and model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, at his side.\"I ask the French people — whether they voted for me or not, whether they support me or not — to grasp what has just happened. Hatred truly knows no bounds,\" he said.The court described his behaviour as \"exceptionally serious\" and said his involvement in efforts to raise campaign funds from Libya were \"capable of undermining the citizen&#x27;s trust in public institutions.\"\"The goal of the criminal conspiracy was to give you an advantage in the electoral campaign,\" the court ruled.Sarkozy was interior minister before winning the presidency in 2007. The court said he used his position \"to prepare an act of corruption at the highest level\".Sarkozy described the financing plot as simply \"an idea.\"\"I am being convicted for supposedly allowing two of my staff members to go ahead with the idea — the idea — of illegal financing for my campaign,\" he said.The court found that two of Sarkozy&#x27;s closest associates when he was president - former ministers Claude Guéant and Brice Hortefeux - were guilty of criminal association, but likewise acquitted them of some other charges.The chief judge, in an hours-long reading of the lengthy verdict, said Sarkozy allowed his associates to reach out to Libyan authorities \"to obtain or try to obtain financial support in Libya.\"But the court also said it couldn&#x27;t determine with certainty that Libyan money ended up financing Sarkozy&#x27;s campaign. The court explained that under French law, a corrupt scheme can still be a crime even if money wasn&#x27;t paid or cannot be proven.Sarkozy, who was elected in 2007 but lost his bid for reelection in 2012, denied all wrongdoing during a three-month trial earlier this year that involved 11 co-defendants, including three former ministers.Despite multiple legal scandals that have clouded his presidential legacy, Sarkozy remains an influential figure in right-wing politics in France and in entertainment circles, by virtue of his marriage to Bruni-Sarkozy.Alleged Libya financingThe accusations trace their roots to 2011, when a Libyan news agency and former Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi said the Libyan state had secretly funnelled millions of euros into Sarkozy&#x27;s 2007 campaign.In 2012, the French investigative outlet Mediapart published what it said was a Libyan intelligence memo referencing a €50 million ($89 million) funding agreement. Sarkozy denounced the document as a forgery and sued for defamation. The court ruled on Thursday that it \"now appears most likely that this document is a forgery\".Investigators also looked into a series of trips to Libya made by people close to Sarkozy when he served as interior minister from 2005 and 2007, including his chief of staff.In 2016, Franco-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine told Mediapart that he had delivered suitcases filled with cash from Tripoli to the French Interior Ministry under Sarkozy. He later retracted his statement.That reversal is now the focus of a separate investigation into possible witness tampering. Both Sarkozy and his wife were handed preliminary charges for involvement in alleged efforts to pressure Takieddine. That case has not gone to trial yet.Takieddine, who was one of the co-defendants, died on Tuesday in Beirut. He was 75. He had fled to Lebanon in 2020 and did not attend the trial.Prosecutors alleged that Sarkozy had knowingly benefited from what they described as a \"corruption pact\" with Gadhafi&#x27;s government.The longtime dictator was toppled and killed in an uprising in 2011, ending his four-decade rule of the North African country.Sarkozy denounced a &#x27;plot&#x27;The trial shed light on France&#x27;s back-channel talks with Libya in the 2000s, when Gadhafi was seeking to restore diplomatic ties with the West. Before that, Libya was considered a pariah state.Sarkozy has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated and reliant on forged evidence. During the trial, he denounced a \"plot\" he said was staged by \"liars and crooks\" including the \"Gadhafi clan\".He suggested that the allegations of illegal campaign financing were retaliation for his call — as France&#x27;s president — for Gadhafi&#x27;s removal.Sarkozy was one of the first Western leaders to push for military intervention in Libya in 2011, when Arab Spring pro-democracy protests swept the Arab world.\"What credibility can be given to such statements marked by the seal of vengeance?\" Sarkozy asked in comments during the trial.Stripped of the Legion of HonourIn June, Sarkozy was stripped of his Legion of Honour medal — France&#x27;s highest award — after his conviction in a separate case.Earlier, he was found guilty of corruption and influence peddling for trying to bribe a magistrate in 2014 in exchange for information about a legal case in which he was implicated.Sarkozy was sentenced to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet for one year. He was granted a conditional release in May due to his age, which allowed him to remove the electronic tag after just over three months.In another case, Sarkozy was convicted last year of illegal campaign financing in his failed 2012 reelection bid. He was accused of having spent almost twice the maximum legal amount and was sentenced to a year in prison, of which six months were suspended.Sarkozy has denied the allegations. He has appealed that verdict to the highest Court of Cassation, and that appeal is pending.
