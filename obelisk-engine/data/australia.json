All they want is their father to be returned, their grandfather to be returned,\" Marks said.Once again, Marks urged kidnappers to release Baghsarian.\"Let us know where he is. Please put him somewhere safe, contact somebody, doesn&#x27;t have to be the police, but just contact somebody to say where Mr Baghsarian is and we&#x27;ll do the rest.

The Toyota used in the kidnapping was later found burned out in the nearby suburb of North Turramurra.Anyone with information or who has witnessed something out of the ordinary is urged to contact the police.
