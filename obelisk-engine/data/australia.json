          "content": "A defiant Nicolás Maduro has declared himself the \"president of my country\" as he protested his capture and pleaded not guilty this morning to the US federal drug trafficking charges that the Trump administration used to justify removing him from power. \"I was captured,\" the Venezuelan leader said in Spanish as translated by a courtroom reporter before being cut off by the judge. Asked later for his plea to the charges, he stated: \"I&#x27;m innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man, the president of my country.\" READ MORE: Trump suggests military action could be coming for Mexico, ColombiaThe courtroom appearance on Monday (Tuesday morning AEDT) was Maduro&#x27;s first since he and his wife were seized from their home in a stunning middle-of-the-night military operation. It kick-starts the US government&#x27;s most consequential prosecution in decades of a foreign head of state. The criminal case in Manhattan is unfolding against the diplomatic backdrop of an audacious US-engineered regime change that President Donald Trump has said will enable his administration to \"run\" the South American country.Maduro, wearing a blue jail uniform, and his wife were led into court about midday for a brief, but required, legal proceeding that will likely kick off a prolonged legal fight over whether he can be put on trial in the US. Both put on headsets to hear the English-language proceeding as it is translated into Spanish.The couple were transported under armed guard hours earlier from the Brooklyn jail where they&#x27;ve been detained to a Manhattan courthouse.The trip was swift. A motorcade carrying Maduro left jail about 7.15am and made its way to a nearby athletic field, where Maduro slowly made his way to a waiting helicopter. The chopper flew across New York harbour and landed at a Manhattan heliport, where Maduro, limping, was loaded into an armoured vehicle.A few minutes later, the law enforcement caravan was inside a garage at the courthouse complex, just around the corner from the one where Donald Trump was convicted in 2024 of falsifying business records. Across the street from the courthouse, the police separated a small but growing group of protesters from about a dozen pro-intervention demonstrators, including one man who pulled a Venezuelan flag away from those protesting the US action.As a criminal defendant in the US legal system, Maduro will have the same rights as any other person accused of a crime — including the right to a trial by a jury of regular New Yorkers. But he&#x27;ll also be nearly — but not quite — unique.Maduro&#x27;s lawyers are expected to contest the legality of his arrest, arguing that he is immune from prosecution as a sovereign head of state.Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriegaun successfully tried the same defence after the US captured him in a similar military invasion in 1990. But the US doesn&#x27;t recognise Maduro as Venezuela&#x27;s legitimate head of state — particularly after a much-disputed 2024 reelection.Venezuela&#x27;s new interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, has demanded that the US return Maduro, who long denied any involvement in drug trafficking — although late on Sunday she also struck a more conciliatory tone in a social media post, inviting collaboration with Trump and \"respectful relations\" with the US.Before his capture, Maduro and his allies claimed US hostility was motivated by lust for Venezuela&#x27;s rich oil and mineral resources.READ MORE: Rubio denies US will &#x27;run&#x27; Venezuela despite Trump&#x27;s commentsThe US seized Maduro and his wife in a military operation on Saturday, capturing them in their home on a military base. Trump said the US would \"run\" Venezuela temporarily, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday that it would not govern the country day-to-day other than enforcing an existing \"oil quarantine\".Trump suggested on Sunday that he wants to extend American power further in the western hemisphere.Speaking aboard Air Force One, he called Colombia&#x27;s president, Gustavo Petro, \"a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States. And he&#x27;s not going to be doing it very long.\"He called on Venezuela&#x27;s Rodriguez to provide \"total access\" to her country, or else face consequences.A 25-page indictment made public on Saturday accuses Maduro and others of working with drug cartels to facilitate the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the US. They could face life in prison if convicted.READ MORE: Venezuela&#x27;s billions in distressed debt: Who is in line to collect?It wasn&#x27;t clear as of Sunday whether Maduro had hired a US lawyer yet.He and his wife, Cilia Flores, have been under US sanctions for years, making it illegal for any American to take money from them without first securing a licence from the Treasury Department.While the indictment against Maduro says Venezuelan officials worked directly with the Tren de Aragua gang, a US intelligence assessment published in April, drawing on input from the intelligence community&#x27;s 18 agencies, found no coordination between Tren de Aragua and the Venezuelan government.Maduro, his wife and his son — who remains free — are charged along with Venezuela&#x27;s interior and justice minister, a former interior and justice minister and Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, an alleged Tren de Aragua leader who has been criminally charged in another case and remains at large.Among other things, the indictment accuses Maduro and his wife of ordering kidnappings, beatings and murders of those who owed them drug money or undermined their drug trafficking operation. That included a local drug boss&#x27; killing in Caracas, the indictment said.Maduro&#x27;s wife is also accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in 2007 to arrange a meeting between \"a large-scale drug trafficker\" and the director of Venezuela&#x27;s National Anti-Drug Office, resulting in additional monthly bribes, with some of the money going to Maduro&#x27;s wife, according to the indictment.",

Intervention has never brought democracy, never has generated wellbeing, nor lasting stability.\"The president noted 300 tonnes of drugs seized by Mexican authorities and a drop in homicides during her presidency, but added that the US has a responsibility to address its demand for drugs.Sheinbaum said her administration had previously agreed with the Trump administration to collaborate and coordinate while respecting each country&#x27;s sovereignty. She said regional economic integration was the path forward.China cannot accept US acting as &#x27;world&#x27;s police&#x27; China&#x27;s Foreign Minister Wang Yi alluded to the \"sudden developments\" in Venezuela during a meeting in Beijing alongside is Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar.China&#x27;s top diplomat said Beijing won&#x27;t accept any country acting as the \"world&#x27;s police\" after Maduro and his wife were captured. \"We have never believed that any country can act as the world&#x27;s police, nor do we accept that any nation can claim to be the world&#x27;s judge,\" he said.\"The sovereignty and security of all countries should be fully protected under international law.\"Australia&#x27;s reaction The response from many foreign governments around the world – including Australia – has been measured.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the Australian government urges \"all parties to support dialogue and diplomacy in order to secure regional stability and prevent escalation\", but stopped short of criticising the operation itself.\"Australia has long held concerns about the situation in Venezuela, including the need to respect democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms,\" the PM said.\"We continue to support international law and a peaceful, democratic transition in Venezuela that reflects the will of the Venezuelan people.\"\"We should live in a world where dictators and despots face justice for their crimes.\"British Prime Minister Keir Starmer initially said he was working to \"establish the facts\".In a second update posted to X, Starmer said the UK supported a transition of power in Venezuela.\"We regarded Maduro as an illegitimate President and we shed no tears about the end of his regime,\" Starmer said.French President Emmanuel Macron reacted with a similarly tempered response. \"The transition to come must be peaceful, democratic, and respectful of the will of the Venezuelan people. We hope that President Edmundo González Urrutia, elected in 2024, will be able to ensure this transition as quickly as possible,\" Macron wrote on X.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said his government would \"take our time\" to evaluate the developments in Venezuela. Merz added that \"a transition to a government legitimised by elections must be ensured\" and said \"political instability must not arise in Venezuela\".https://x.com/Keir_Starmer/status/2007540837224255602Some celebration Opposition Leader Sussan Ley said she welcomed the news and that Maduro was now facing justice after serving as an \"illegitimate president\". \"Under his rule, Venezuela has endured years of repression, systemic human rights abuses, corruption, and the crushing of basic democratic freedoms,\" Ley said in a joint statement alongside Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister Michaelia Cash.\"The Venezuelan people deserve the chance to restore their sovereignty through a peaceful return to democracy.Israel&#x27;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump in a post on X.\"Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump for your bold and historic leadership on behalf of freedom and justice,\" Netanyahu wrote.\"I salute your decisive resolve and the brilliant action of your brave soldiers.\"President of Argentina Javier Milei opted for a similarly celebratory response.\"What we have to understand is that it&#x27;s the collapse of the regime of a dictator that was rigging elections, that in the last election was badly defeated and, despite that, he clung on to power,\" he told reporters.\"That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d say that today&#x27;s news is excellent news for the free world.\"&#x27; This is deeply concerning and condemnable&#x27;Other foreign governments swiftly responded with strong criticism of the US&#x27; military action.

All 10 were mandated to attend cyberbullying awareness training.The court pointed to \"particularly degrading, insulting, and malicious\" comments referring to false claims regarding alleged trans identity and alleged paedo criminality targeting Mrs Macron. \"Repeated publications have had cumulative harmful effects,\" the court said.READ MORE: Alleged Bondi gunman transferred to SupermaxThe defendants, eight men and two women aged 41 to 65, were accused of having posted numerous comments falsely claiming that President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s wife was born a man and likening their 24-year age gap to paedophilia. Some of the posts were viewed tens of thousands of times.Mrs Macron did not attend the two-day trial in October. Speaking on TF1 national television on Sunday, she said she launched legal proceedings to \"set an example\" in the fight against harassment.Her lawyer, Jean Ennochi, said on Monday \"what is important is that there are immediate cyberbullying awareness trainings, and for some of the defendants, a ban on using their social media accounts\".Her daughter, Tiphaine Auzière, testified about what she described as the \"deterioration\" of her mother&#x27;s life since the online harassment intensified.\"She cannot ignore the horrible things said about her,\" Auzière told the court. She said the impact has extended to the entire family, including Mrs Macron&#x27;s grandchildren.One of the defendants, a property asset manager, received a six-month prison sentence. Under French law, the sentence may be served at home, possibly while wearing an ankle monitor or following other requirements set by a judge.READ MORE: Trump suggests military action could be coming for Mexico, ColombiaDefendant Delphine Jegousse, 51, who is known as Amandine Roy and describes herself as a medium and an author, is considered to have played a major role in spreading the rumour after she released a four-hour video on her YouTube channel in 2021. She was given a six-month prison sentence.The X account of Aurélien Poirson-Atlan, 41, known as Zoé Sagan on social media, was suspended in 2024 after his name was cited in several judicial investigations. Poirson-Atlan was given an eight-month prison sentence, along with another defendant, a gallery owner.The one defendant not given a prison sentence was a teacher, who apologised during the trial. He will have to attend the cyberbullying awareness training.Several will see their online access suspended for six months on the social media platform where they made their posts.The sentences were proportional to the seriousness of the comments, the court stressed.French judicial authorities didn&#x27;t disclose the names of the defendants, but some made their names public by speaking outDuring the trial, several defendants told the court their comments were intended as humour or satire and said they did not understand why they were being prosecuted.The case follows years of conspiracy theories falsely alleging that Mrs Macron was born under the name Jean-Michel Trogneux, which is actually the name of her brother. The Macrons have also filed a defamation suit in the United States against conservative influencer Candace Owens.The Macrons, who have been married since 2007, first met at the high school where he was a student and she was a teacher. Mrs Macron, 24 years her husband&#x27;s senior, was then called Brigitte Auzière, a married mother of three.Mr Macron, 48, has been France&#x27;s president since 2017.",
