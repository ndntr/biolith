Minns also said it was important to ensure the commission did not interfere with the trial of accused shooter Naveed Akram.READ MORE: Aussies could save hundreds by doing one simple thing \"That&#x27;s how we&#x27;re going to get justice for the victims and their families and the community,\" he said.\"But I think that we can get a discerning judge who has understanding and experience about criminal procedures to give us as many of the answers as possible in a short period of time as possible.\"Asked about Albanese&#x27;s reluctance to hold a federal royal commission, Minns said he was unable to comment on Commonwealth decisions but that he expected full co-operation.\"I&#x27;ve been told, and I expect, that any royal commission from NSW will have access to agencies, any agency, any person, any official, anyone they need to speak to, to get to the answers ,\" Minns said.Albanese has already pledged federal support for the state commission. &#x27;We demand answers&#x27; The grieving families of 11 of the Bondi victims demanded a commonwealth royal commission examine \"the rapid rise of antisemitism in Australia following Hamas&#x27; attack on October 7, 2023, and the law enforcement, intelligence, and policy failures that led to the Bondi Beach massacre\", in a letter published in full in Nine newspapers.\"We demand answers and solutions,\" they wrote.READ MORE: Three teens charged with murdering man in shopping centre car park on Christmas Eve\" We need to know why clear warning signs were ignored, how antisemitic hatred and Islamic extremism were allowed to dangerously grow unchecked, and what changes must be made to protect all Australians going forward.\"SYDNEY TO HOBART: Master Lock Comanche crew celebrates &#x27;redemption&#x27; victory \"Announcements made so far by the federal government in response to the Bondi massacre are not nearly enough,\" the families wrote.\"Prime Minister, how can you not support a royal commission into the deadliest terrorist attack on Australian soil? Royal commissions have been established for banks and for aged care.\"The letter-writers said there was \"unprecedented\" support for a federal commission as the problem of rising antisemitism extended far beyond state borders.READ MORE: Father charged after allegedly showing Nazi tattoos on Newcastle beach \"You owe us answers. You owe us accountability. And you owe Australians the truth,\" they wrote.Albanese has previously defended his stance by pointing out that no federal royal commissions were held in the wake of the 1996 Port Arthur massacre or the 2014 Lindt Cafe siege.However, critics - including the families who signed the letter - say that there have been years of escalating attacks on the Jewish community without sufficient response from authorities.You can read the letter from the victims&#x27; families in full below.The families of those murdered at Bondi call for a commonwealth royal commissionWe, the families of those killed and injured in the Bondi Beach massacre, call on the Prime Minister to immediately establish a Commonwealth Royal Commission into the rapid rise of antisemitism in Australia following Hamas&#x27; attack on October 7, 2023, and the law enforcement, intelligence, and policy failures that led to the Bondi Beach massacre.We demand answers and solutions.We need to know why clear warning signs were ignored, how antisemitic hatred and Islamic extremism were allowed to dangerously grow unchecked, and what changes must be made to protect all Australians going forward.As proud Australians and proud Jews, we have endured more than two and a half years of relentless attacks. Our children feel unsafe at school and university. Our homes, workplaces, sporting fields, and public spaces no longer feel secure. It is an intolerable situation that no Australian should have to endure.Announcements made so far by the federal government in response to the Bondi massacre are not nearly enough.Prime Minister, how can you not support a Royal Commission into the deadliest terrorist attack on Australian soil? Royal Commissions have been established for banks and for aged care.We have lost parents, spouses, children, and grandparents.Our loved ones were celebrating Chanukah at Bondi Beach, a festival of light and joy, in an iconic public space that should have been safe.You owe us answers. You owe us accountability. And you owe Australians the truth.Senior legal, security, and political leaders from across the country have come together in an unprecedented display of public support for a Commonwealth Royal Commission. The rise of antisemitism in Australia goes far beyond one state jurisdiction. It is a national crisis that demands a powerful national response.In just the past few days following the Bondi attack, a Jewish family&#x27;s car was firebombed, and a man in Western Australia was arrested after posting messages of support following the Bondi attack while stockpiling weapons and in possession of Hamas and Hezbollah flags. This threat is real, and it is escalating.The dangerous rise of antisemitism and radicalism in Australia is not going away.We need strong action now. We need leadership now.You cannot bring back our loved ones. But with a well-led Commonwealth Royal Commission and strong action, you may be able to save many more.Abesidon FamilyAmzalak FamilyBritvan FamilyBrutman FamilyGoldhirsch FamilyGurman FamilyGutnick FamilyJoseph FamilyKastel FamilyKleytman FamilyLevitan FamilyMorrison FamilySchlanger FamilyTetelroyd FamilyTretiak FamilyUlman FamilyWeitzen Family",

          "content": "China&#x27;s military on Monday dispatched air, navy and rocket troops to conduct joint military drills around the island of Taiwan, a move Beijing called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces. Taiwan said it was placing its forces on alert and called the Chinese government “the biggest destroyer of peace.”The drills came after Beijing expressed anger at US arms sales to the territory and a statement by Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, saying its military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that the world’s second-biggest economy says must come under its rule. READ MORE: Prime Minister rejects plea from Bondi shooting victims&#x27; families But the Chinese military did not mention the United States and Japan in its statement.Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said in a post on X that rapid response exercises were underway, with forces on high alert to defend the island. In a separate statement, it said it had deployed appropriate forces in response, conducting combat readiness drills.“The Chinese Communist Party’s targeted military exercises further confirm its nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace,” the ministry said.READ MORE: Legionnaires&#x27; disease outbreak in Sydney CBD grows Senior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;s Eastern Theater Command, said the drills would be conducted in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, southwest, southeast and east of the island.Shi said the activities will focus on sea-air combat readiness patrol, “joint seizure of comprehensive superiority” and blockades on key ports. It was also the first large-scale military drill where the command publicly mentioned one of the goals was “all-dimensional deterrence outside the island chain.\"“It is a stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces, and it is a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China’s sovereignty and national unity,” Shi said.China and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949, when a civil war brought the Communist Party to power in Beijing. Defeated Nationalist Party forces fled to Taiwan. The island has operated since then with its own government, though the mainland’s government claims it as sovereign territory.Live firing exercises scheduled for TuesdayThe command said it was using fighters, bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles in coordination with long-range rocket launches to conduct drills in the sea and airspace in the middle areas of the Taiwan Strait on Monday, focusing on striking mobile ground targets. They are intended to test the troops&#x27; capabilities of precision strikes on key targets, it said.It also said major military drills were scheduled to happen between 8am and 6pm on Tuesday, saying it would organise live firing activities then, and its exercises would cover five areas around the island.The command released themed posters about the drills online accompanied by provocative wording. One poster depicted two shields with the Great Wall alongside three military aircraft and two ships. Its social media post said the drills were about the “Shield of Justice, Smashing Illusion,\" adding that any foreign interlopers or separatists touching the shields would be eliminated.Last week, Beijing imposed sanctions against 20 US defense-related companies and 10 executives, a week after Washington announced large-scale arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion. If approved by the US Congress, it would be the largest-ever American weapons package to the self-ruled territory.Under US federal law in place for many years, Washington is obligated to assist Taipei with its defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China. The US and Taiwan had formal diplomatic relations until 1979, when President Jimmy Carter’s administration recognised and established relations with Beijing.READ MORE: Russia is &#x27;helping China to prepare for a potential invasion of Taiwan&#x27; Taiwanese army on high alertMonday&#x27;s drills heightened tensions on both sides. Karen Kuo, spokesperson for the Taiwanese president&#x27;s office, said the operation was undermining the stability and security of the Taiwan Strait and Indo-Pacific region and openly challenging international law and order.“Our country strongly condemns the Chinese authorities for disregarding international norms and using military intimidation to threaten neighboring countries.” she said.Beijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a near-daily basis, and in recent years it has stepped up the scope and scale of these exercises. In October, the Taiwanese government said it would accelerate the building of a “Taiwan Shield” or “T-Dome” air defense system in the face of the military threat from China.The military tensions came a day after Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said he hoped the Taiwan Strait would be associated with peace and prosperity, instead of “crashing waves and howling winds,\" during a trip to Shanghai.",
