          "content": "Hamas says it has accepted some elements of US President Donald Trump&#x27;s plan to end the war in the Gaza Strip, including giving up power and releasing all remaining hostages, but that others require further consultations among Palestinians.The statement came hours after Trump said that Hamas must agree to the deal by Sunday evening (Monday AEDT), threatening an even greater military onslaught nearly two years into the war sparked by the October 7 attack into Israel.It was unclear how the US and Israel would respond to partial acceptance.READ MORE: Sean &#x27;Diddy Combs jailed on prostitution-related chargesHamas said it was willing to release hostages according to the plan&#x27;s “formula\", likely referring to the release of Palestinian prisoners. It also reiterated its longstanding openness to handing power over to a politically independent Palestinian body.But it said aspects of the proposal touching on the future of the Gaza Strip and Palestinian rights should be decided on the basis of a “unanimous Palestinian stance” reached with other factions and based on international law.The statement also made no mention of Hamas disarming, a key Israeli demand included in Trump’s proposal.Trump&#x27;s plan would end the fighting and return hostagesTrump appears keen to deliver on pledges to end the war and return dozens of hostages ahead of the second anniversary of the attack on Tuesday.His peace plan has been accepted by Israel and welcomed internationally, but key mediators Egypt and Qatar have also said some elements needed further negotiation, without elaborating.“An Agreement must be reached with Hamas by Sunday Evening at SIX (6) P.M., Washington, D.C. time,” Trump wrote Friday on social media.READ MORE: Consular officials head to Israeli prison after five Australians activists detained “Every Country has signed on! If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas. THERE WILL BE PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.”Under the plan, which Trump unveiled earlier this week alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Hamas would immediately release the remaining 48 hostages — around 20 of them believed to be alive. It would also give up power and disarm.In return, Israel would halt its offensive and withdraw from much of the territory, release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and allow an influx of humanitarian aid and eventual reconstruction.Plans to relocate much of Gaza&#x27;s population to other countries would be shelved.The territory of some two million Palestinians would be placed under international governance, with Trump himself and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair overseeing it. The plan provides no path for eventual reunification with the Israeli-occupied West Bank in a future Palestinian state.A Hamas official told The Associated Press this week that some elements of the plan were unacceptable and need to be amended, without elaborating.Palestinians long for an end to the war, but many view this and previous US proposals as strongly favoring Israel.US and Israel seek to pressure HamasIsrael has sought to ramp up pressure on Hamas since ending an earlier ceasefire in March. It sealed the territory off from food, medicine and other goods for two-and-a-half months and has seized, flattened and largely depopulated large areas of the territory.Experts determined that Gaza City had slid into famine shortly before Israel launched a major offensive aimed at occupying it. An estimated 400,000 people have fled the city in recent weeks, but hundreds of thousands more have stayed behind.Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the UN humanitarian office, said she saw several displaced families staying in the parking lot of Shifa Hospital during a visit on Thursday.“They are not able to move south because they just cannot afford it,” Cherevko told The Associated Press. “One of the families had three children and the woman was pregnant with her fourth. And there were many other vulnerable cases there, including elderly people and people with disabilities.”Trump wrote that most of Hamas&#x27; fighters were \"surrounded and MILITARILY TRAPPED, just waiting for me to give the word, ‘GO,’ for their lives to be quickly extinguished. As for the rest, we know where and who you are, and you will be hunted down, and killed.”Most of Hamas&#x27; top leaders in Gaza and thousands of its fighters have already been killed, but it still has influence in areas not controlled by the Israeli military and launches sporadic attacks that have killed and wounded Israeli soldiers.Hamas has held firm to its position that it will only release the remaining hostages — its sole bargaining chip and potential human shields — in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. Netanyahu has rejected those terms, saying Hamas must surrender and disarm.Second anniversary approachesThousands of Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on October 7, 2023, attacking army bases, farming communities and an outdoor music festival, killing some 1200 people, mostly civilians.They abducted 251 others, most of them since released in ceasefires or other deals.Israel&#x27;s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 66,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza&#x27;s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. It says women and children make up around half the dead.The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, and the UN and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.The offensive has displaced around 90 per cent of Gaza&#x27;s population, often multiple times, and left much of the territory uninhabitable.Both the Biden and Trump administrations have tried to end the fighting and bring back the hostages while providing extensive military and diplomatic support to Israel.",

They were presenting their sentencing recommendation early on Friday afternoon.His nearly two-month trial in a federal court in Manhattan featured testimony from women who described being beaten, threatened, sexually assaulted and blackmailed by Combs, who was expected to speak in court later on Friday, after his children.Prosecutor Christy Slavik told US District Judge Arun Subramanian that not sentencing Combs to significant prison time would, in effect, be allowing him to get away with years of domestic violence. She said Friday&#x27;s focus was on accountability.\"It&#x27;s a case about a man who did horrible things to real people to satisfy his own sexual gratification,\" Prosecutor Christy Slavik said.\"He didn&#x27;t need the money. His currency was control.\"Prosecutors also blasted Combs for, according to them, having booked a speaking gig in Miami next week - apparently assuming he&#x27;d be free to do it.\"That is the height of hubris,\" Slavik said.Combs was convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, in violation of the federal Mann Act.One of Combs&#x27; attorneys, Jason Driscoll, told the judge that the Mann Act should never have been applied to Combs. Another of his lawyers, Nicole Westmoreland, became emotional as she explained how Combs inspired her personally.\"Mr. Combs is not larger than life. He&#x27;s a human being. And he&#x27;s made some mistakes. He has flaws, like we all do,\" Westmoreland said.\"But judge, how many of us can say that we helped so many lives, countless lives?\"Several of Combs&#x27; children later crowded around the podium, imploring the judge to give their father a second chance.\"My father is my superhero. Seeing him broken down and stripped of everything is something I will never forget,\" Combs&#x27; son, Justin Combs, said. He suggested that as tough as the ordeal has been, it probably saved Combs&#x27; life because, during his year in jail, he has kicked drugs and alcohol.His daughters Chance and D&#x27;Lila Combs cried as they read prepared remarks, D&#x27;Lila saying she fears losing their father to prison and effectively being parentless after the 2018 death of her mother, Kim Porter.In all, six of Combs&#x27; seven children spoke. His youngest daughter, Love, didn&#x27;t speak, but she&#x27;s just two years old.Subramanian, who will decide the sentence, has twice denied bail and signalled Combs is unlikely to walk out of federal custody soon.On Friday, the judge said that although Combs was acquitted of certain charges, the verdict didn&#x27;t absolve him of underlying conduct, such as violence and coercion.Former girlfriend and R&B singer Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura told jurors that Combs ordered her to have \"disgusting\" sex with strangers hundreds of times during their decade-long relationship. The jury was repeatedly shown video of him dragging and beating her in a Los Angeles hotel hallway after one such multiday \"freak-off.\"A woman who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane\" said she was subjected to violence and felt obligated to perform sexually with male sex workers at drug-fuelled \"hotel nights\" while Combs watched and sometimes filmed.The only Combs accuser scheduled to speak in person on Friday backed out after defensce objections.The woman, a former personal assistant who testified under the pseudonym \"Mia,\" accused Combs of raping her in 2010 and has urged the judge to impose a sentence reflecting \"the ongoing danger my abuser poses to me, and to others\".Defence lawyers also planned to show an 11-minute video highlighting his family life, career and philanthropy.Combs entered the courtroom wearing a light-coloured sweater, button-down shirt and dark pants. He hugged his lawyers and greeted his family and supporters. Outside the courthouse, photographers and onlookers swarmed.To support their racketeering case, prosecutors had witnesses testify about other violent acts. One of Cassie&#x27;s friends said Combs dangled her from a 17th floor balcony. The rapper Kid Cudi testified Combs broke into his home after learning he was dating Cassie.In a letter to the judge on Thursday, Combs said, \"The old me died in jail and a new version of me was reborn,\" promising he would never commit another crime.Cassie, in her own letter, described him as an abuser who \"will always be the same cruel, power-hungry, manipulative man that he is.\"Combs&#x27; lawyers say the sexual encounters were consensual and that a year in jail has spurred his sobriety and remorse.At a hearing last week, Combs told his mother and children that he is \"getting closer to going home\".DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

She will also have to confront concerns that church leaders haven&#x27;t done enough to stamp out the sexual abuse scandals that have dogged the church for more than a decade.Naming a woman to the position is a major milestone for a church that ordained its first female priests in 1994 and its first female bishop in 2015. Mullally follows 105 men who have led Anglicans worldwide.READ MORE: Heartbroken mum calls for vaccines to be funded after teen&#x27;s sudden deathBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed the appointment of Mullally to the role and wished her success.\"The Church of England is of profound importance to this country,\" Starmer said. \"Its churches, cathedrals, schools, and charities are part of the fabric of our communities. The Archbishop of Canterbury will play a key role in our national life.\"She will replace former archbishop, Justin Welby, who announced his resignation in November after an independent investigation found he failed to tell police about serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps as soon as he became aware of it.\"The new archbishop will be faced with declining church attendance, bloated management structures and clergy squabbling over what people do in the bedroom,\" Andrew Graystone, an advocate for church abuse survivors, told Britain&#x27;s Press Association. \"But the biggest challenge for the new archbishop is to restore trust after a decade of abuse scandals.\"While the choice of the new archbishop will be made in England and ratified by King Charles III, it will have ramifications around the world.READ MORE: Council plan may render great-grandparents&#x27; home &#x27;unsellable, worth nothing&#x27;The Anglican Communion has more than 85 million members spread across 165 countries, including the Episcopal Church in the United States. While each national church has its own leader, the Archbishop of Canterbury is considered first among equals.The process for Mullally was an 11-month marathon presided over by a committee of some 20 people chaired by the former director-general of MI5, Britain&#x27;s domestic spy agency.\"At least on the last few occasions, a new pope has been selected at great speed, but to select the Archbishop of Canterbury, which is not exactly equivalent but what many might see as a relatively equivalent position, it takes months,\" said George Gross, an expert on monarchy and modern religious thought at King&#x27;s College London.But it&#x27;s not the most transparent of processes. There was no published shortlist of candidates, nor an open vote. It was more a slow process of sounding out various interest groups to figure out which of the current bishops might be able to lead the church forward.",
