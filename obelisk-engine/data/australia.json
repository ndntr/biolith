Police have today alleged the homemade improvised explosive device contained a mixture of volatile and potentially explosive chemicals, with nails and metal ball bearings affixed to the exterior.\"We will allege that that device was designed to explode upon impact, but for reasons not yet known, it didn&#x27;t,\" WA Police Commissioner Col Blanch told radio station 6PR this morning.\"This was responded to as a mass casualty event, a potential mass casualty event,\" Blanch said last night.Police raided a home in Warwick yesterday, where they allegedly found chemicals and materials commonly used to make homemade explosives.The 31-year-old man was today charged with making or possessing explosives under suspicious circumstances and one count of an unlawful act or omission with intent to harm.READ MORE: Two men killed in light plane crash south of Brisbane as scrub fire burnsHe was refused bail to appear before Perth Magistrates Court today.WA Premier Roger Cook yesterday slammed the bomb scare as \"completely unacceptable\".\"This Australia Day should be about unity, not division.

But organisers and attendees, like Tanesha Bennell, said they felt \"angry and frustrated\" that the event was impacted by the threat.\"Not surprised though, this is very standard. I feel sad that once again our Elders are being silenced,\" Bennell said.\"They were grabbing Elders, Aunties and Uncles, taking them away from their place to speak,\" another attendee claimed.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
