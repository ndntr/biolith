          "content": "The Bondi Beach terror attack, Australia&#x27;s worst mass shooting in almost 30 years, has left at least 15 victims dead, including a gunman, and 25 injured.The horrific incident targeted Sydney&#x27;s Jewish community, including families and children, at a beachfront Hanukkah event just before sunset on Sunday evening. How the Bondi Beach terror attack unfoldedSajid Akram, 50, and Naveed Akram, 24, left a short-term rental address in Campsie in Sydney&#x27;s south at around 5.15pm on Sunday evening.The pair arrive in Bondi at around 6 :40pm, parking their car on Campbell Parade at the northern end of Bondi Beach.Sajid is believed to be wearing a black shirt and white pants, whilst Naveed is wearing a black shirt and black pants.They were armed with multiple guns and are accused of taking position on a pedestrian bridge nearby, which had a clear view of Archer Park.At the time, the Chanukah by the Sea event was being held there, with more than 1000 people in the immediate area of the family festival.Soon after, the first shots were fired by both men.Emergency services were called at 6.43pm following reports of gunshots.Video footage, which commenced around 90 seconds after the shooting began, shows Naveed staying on the bridge, whilst Sajid moves off the bridge and walks towards Archer Park, allowing him to get closer to the large group of people.The same video captured footage of a man, later identified as Ahmed el Ahmed, emerging from behind a car to tackle one of the gunmen.He grabs him around the neck and forces him to drop the gun, before pointing it towards him.Ahmed does not fire the gun, but instead hides it and takes cover; he was later shot and wounded, and is currently recovering in hospital.Around a minute later the gunman is seen returning to the bridge and firing once again, presumably with another weapon. He is shot on the bridge by police, where he dies at the scene.Naveed continues firing for approximately 90 seconds further, before being shot by police, and tackled to the ground.Video also shown an innocent bystander approach Naveed, before raising his hands in the air to avoid being confused as being another attacker. Naveed was taken into custody, and he is currently in hospital under police guard. The shooting is believed to have lasted for around nine minutes, with first responders arriving on the scene less than 10 minutes after the initial call.By 6:47pm the shooting had stopped and emergency services were being flooded with reports. At about 7pm, NSW Police issued a critical warning through social media alerting the public of a \"developing incident\" at the iconic beach, urging them to avoid the area.By 7.41pm, authorities said two people were in police custody. Shortly after, they confirmed earlier reports of a second alleged incident in nearby Dover Heights were false.At 9:36pm NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon designates the shooting as a terrorist incident, triggering new laws and investigative powers.The horror of the shooting was confirmed to the public in a press conference at 9.50pm when NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon confirmed at least 12 people had died during the attack and at least 29 others had been injured.One of the first victims identified in the mass shooting was Rabbi Eli Schlanger, an assistant Rabbi at Chabad of Bondi. He was a key organiser of the Chanukah by the Sea event.The numbers later rose to 16, with 15 innocent victims as well as the gunmen. READ MORE: What we know about the Bondi Beach shooting &#x27;No place for this hate&#x27; says Prime MinisterAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese addressed the attack at a press conference at about 10pm on Sunday, labelling the scenes \"shocking and distressing\".\"An attack on Jewish Australians is an attack on every Australian and every Australian tonight will be, like me, devastated about this attack on our way of life,\" he told reporters.\"There is no place for this hate, violence and terrorism in our nation. Let me be clear we will eradicate it.\"If you have been impacted by the terror attack in Bondi there is support available. To contact Lifeline Australia, call 13 11 14 or text 0477 13 11 14.

          "content": "President Donald Trump mocked Rob Reiner in a social media post on Monday, suggesting the slain actor and director died because of his anti-Trump views — a remark that triggered swift and bipartisan backlash for injecting politics into a family tragedy.A vocal Democratic activist, Reiner, 78, and his wife Michele, 70, were found dead in their home on Sunday. Their son Nick Reiner was arrested on homicide charges. Police have yet to ascribe a motive.In a post on Truth Social, Trump referred to Rob Reiner as \"tortured and struggling\" and said Reiner and his wife had passed away \"reportedly due to the anger he caused\" by opposing the Republican president.READ MORE: Rob Reiner&#x27;s son Nick arrested after director and his wife found dead \"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump,\" the president said.The White House reposted Trump&#x27;s comments on its official \"Rapid Response\" account on X.The president, who frequently lashes out at his opponents and praises public figures who support him, offered no evidence that Reiner&#x27;s political views contributed in any way to the couple&#x27;s death.Trump&#x27;s comments on Monday drew criticism from across the political spectrum.\"Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered,\" wrote Republican U.S. Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky.\"This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,\" wrote Republican U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.Both Massie and Greene are Trump critics, a rarity within the president&#x27;s party.But even House Speaker Mike Johnson, a major Trump ally, distanced himself from the president&#x27;s post. \"We have to appeal to our better angels, and I think we&#x27;ve got to amplify those voices and those sentiments. So that&#x27;s my position on it,\" he told reporters when asked about Trump&#x27;s comments.Asked in the Oval Office if he stood by the post after the Republican criticism, Trump replied that he was not a Reiner fan.Reiner told Variety in 2017 during Trump&#x27;s first term that Trump was \"mentally unfit\" and called him \"the single most unqualified human being to ever assume the presidency of the United States.\"Trump said in his post on Monday that Reiner had the \"mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME,\" a term the president uses for many of his critics.The Democratic Party called Trump&#x27;s post \"heartless.\"David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, called it perverse. \"The absence of empathy & grace for the Reiner family in their moment of profound loss and grief is sad and revealing,\" he wrote on X.Republicans and Trump supporters were sharply critical of anyone who highlighted right-leaning activist Charlie Kirk&#x27;s controversial views in the aftermath of his murder in September.Reiner was long one of the most prolific directors in Hollywood, and his work included some of the most memorable movies of the 1980s and &#x27;90s, including This is Spinal Tap, A Few Good Men, When Harry Met Sally, and The Princess Bride.His role as Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic in Norman Lear&#x27;s 1970s TV classic All in the Family, as a liberal foil to O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Archie Bunker, catapulted him to fame and won him two Emmy Awards.The son of comedy legend Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner was married to photographer Michele Singer Reiner since 1989.The two met while he was directing When Harry Met Sally and had three children together: Nick, Jake and Romy.READ MORE: Bondi hero would &#x27;do it again&#x27; despite being &#x27;riddled with bullets&#x27;DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
