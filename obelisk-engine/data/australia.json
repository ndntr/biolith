Dozens more were injured when Sajid and Naveed Akram allegedly fired dozens of shots targeting Jewish people celebrating the first day of Hanukkah on Sunday evening.Twenty-four people remain in several hospitals around Sydney in conditions ranging from stable to critical as of 4.30pm today, according to NSW Health.LIVE UPDATES: Australia mourns as Bondi victims fight for life; Philippines trip by alleged shooters probedTwo were police officers, a constable who exchanged fire with the gunman and a probationary constable.Ahmed El-Ahmed, the hero bystander who helped disarm one of the gunmen, is among the injured recovering at St George Hospital.Those who died are yet to be formally identified, however police believe their ages range between 10 and 87 years.Here is what we know about the victims so far. Matilda — 10-year-old girlThe youngest victim has been identified as 10-year-old Matilda.She smiled for a photo after having her face painted, petted some farm animals and had been enjoying the celebrations with her six-year-old sister on Sunday evening.But when the gunmen opened fire, she was fatally shot in front of her sister. She was rushed to hospital, but could not be saved. Her aunt, Lina Chernykh, shared footage of Matilda taken hours before she was killed.She said the heartbroken family will never recover from their loss.\"A happy kid,\" she told 9News.\"She was open-hearted. Everywhere she goes, she was like a sun.\"Matilda has been remembered as a \"bright, joyful, and spirited child who brought light to everyone around her\", according to her language teacher Irina Goodhew, who has launched a fundraising appeal for her family.\"Yesterday, while celebrating Hanukkah, her young life was tragically taken. Her memory will live on in our hearts,\" she wrote on the fundraising site. Boris and Sofia Gurman - husband and wife Boris, 69, and Sofia Gurman, 61, were a Russian-Jewish couple living in Bondi who were the first victims of the shooting.They were walking when they came across Sajid Akram firing early shots.Dashcam footage showed Boris disarm him, grabbing the gun like a cricket bat and charging at him while his wife watched on.But Akram had more than one weapon. He fired and fatally shot the husband and wife.Their family said their actions proved the type of people they were.\"While nothing can lessen the pain of losing Boris and Sofia, we feel an overwhelming sense of pride in their bravery and selflessness. This encapsulates who Boris and Sofia were – people who instinctively and selflessly tried to help others,\" they said in a statement.His family said the couple were going to celebrate Sofia&#x27;s birthday tomorrow and their 35th wedding anniversay in January.\"Boris was a retired mechanic, known for his generosity, quiet strength and willingness to lend a hand to anyone in need. Sofia worked at Australia Post and was deeply loved by her colleagues and community,\" their family said.The pair were remembered for living \"honest, hardworking lives\" and treating everyone with \"kindness, warmth and respect\".Witnesses described Boris as a \"hero\". \"He was a hero. He tried, he tried. We need to let his family know,\" a witness told 9News.\"Everyone needs to know what he tried, because it was right in the beginning. And he put himself in that face of danger. There were bullets flying already, and he put his self in the face of danger.\"Edith Brutman — community service workerEdith Brutman was a devoted member of the Jewish community who was killed while attending Sunday&#x27;s event.She was the vice president of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith NSW, the state&#x27;s branch of the international Jewish community service organisation.President of the Alfred Dreyfus Unit at B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith, Ernie Friedlander, told The Sydney Morning Herald she was a \"good, caring human being\".\"She was a very clever lady, and she was very, very passionate about dealing with prejudice and discrimination. She was always there, and she had very strong opinions,\" he said.Alex Kleytman — Holocaust survivorAlex Kleytman was an 87-year-old Holocaust survivor who died in the Bondi attack, according to Chabad, a US-based global Hasidic Jewish organisation that hosted the Hanukkah event at Bondi.He is the oldest known victim of the shooting. He had survived the genocide with his mother and younger brother in Siberia before he and his wife, Larisa Kleytman, migrated to Australia from Ukraine.They had been married for nearly 60 years.Larisa, also a Holocaust survivor, confirmed his death to The Australian.\"He came on Bondi Beach to celebrate Hanukkah, for us it was always a very, very good celebration, for many, many years,\" she said.Peter Meagher — former police officerPeter Meagher, a former police officer and Randwick Rugby volunteer and manager, was working as a freelance photographer at the Hanukkah event when he was shot, his club said.Randwick Rugby said he served for almost 40 years with NSW Police and retired as a detective sergeant. \"The tragic irony is that he spent so long in the dangerous front line as a police officer and was struck down in retirement while taking photos in his passion role is really hard to comprehend,\" the club said.Meagher had also worked as a long-time referee before spending much of the last decade as a first-grade manager and volunteer for Randwick Rugby.His club said news of his death has hit the players, coaches, managers, volunteers and supporters \"extremely hard\". \"&#x27;Marzo&#x27;, as he was universally known, was a much-loved figure and absolute legend in our club, with decades of voluntary involvement, he was one of the heart and soul figures of Randwick Rugby,\" the club said.\"Rest in Peace &#x27;Marzo&#x27; - we all love you and will miss you greatly. We are devastated.\"Reuven Morrison — heroReuven Morrison, a 62-year-old immigrant from the Soviet Union, was killed while trying to protect the community from the gunmen.He was captured on footage throwing bricks at Sajid after he was disarmed by local hero Ahmed Al Ahmed.His daughter, Sheina Gutnick, said it was only fitting that her father died while trying to save lives.\"From my sources and understanding, he had jumped up the second the shooting started. He managed to throw bricks at the terrorist,\" she told CBS News.\"He was screaming at the terrorist, and protecting his community, he was shot dead.\"If there was one way for him to go on this earth, it would be fighting a terrorist. There was no other way he would be taken from us. He went down fighting, protecting the people he loved most.\" Gutnick said her father migrated to Australia believing he would be safe. Eli Schlanger — rabbiEli Schlanger was a rabbi, father of five and chaplain for Corrective Services NSW.The 41-year-old, who welcomed his newborn baby just six weeks ago, helped organise the Hanukkah event when he was shot dead.His brother-in-law, rabbi Mendel Kastel, said their \"family is broken\", while his cousin, Zalman Lewis, remembered him as a \"truly an incredible guy\".Rabbi Menachem Dadon, whose daughter was shot but survived, said he had held Schlanger as he died.Alex Ryvchin, of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said Schlanger was the \"best of us\".\"This was a man who got up every morning with the purpose of doing good. That&#x27;s all he did,\" he said.\"He drove around, and he gave things to charity, and he fed the needy. And he visited prisoners in prisons. And he just lived to do good things.\"Corrective Services NSW Commissioner Gary McCahon said Schlanger was a \"valued member\" and was \"devoted to supporting others with compassion and dignity\".\"His loss will be felt by many. I extend my deepest condolences to his family, friends, colleagues, and the broader Jewish community during this immensely painful time,\" he said.Yaakov Levitan — rabbiYaakov Levitan was a rabbi, a father and an active member of the Jewish community who lost his life celebrating the first day of Hanukkah.He served as general manager of Chabad of Bondi, secretary of the Sydney Beth Din centre and a key figure in educational initiatives at the BINA Centre. He has been remembered as a \"profoundly beloved and active member of the Sydney Jewish community\" and the \"cornerstone of his family\".\"He was a man of quiet devotion, known for his kindness and tireless work in assisting others, including his commitment to distributing tefillin as a sacred act of service,\" according to a fundraising page set up to raise money for his family \"His senseless murder has left an irreplaceable void.\"Marika Pogany — lifelong volunteerMarika Pogany was sitting in the front row of the Hanukkah event when she was fatally shot.The 82-year-old was a decade-long volunteer for Meals on Wheels and Coa Sydney, an organisation providing community services to elderly Jewish people.She won an award for service to her community after she delivered more than 12,000 kosher meals.COA Sydney said she was the \"beating heart\" of the organisation and a \"source of warmth for thousands of people\". \"She lifted the room simply by being in it,\" the organisation said in a statement.\"She asked for nothing and gave everything. She showed us what true service looks like and she did it without fanfare and without ever wanting attention.\"We are shattered by her loss. Marika gave real love to this community and her impact runs deep.\"May all those that knew Marika and had the blessing to be touched by her, be comforted and consoled by the memories of a truly remarkable and wonderful woman.\" Her friends told 9News of decades of friendship, saying she was an \"amazing person\" and they were \"very fond of her\".Tibor Weitzen — great-grandfatherTibor Weitzen was a 78-year-old great-grandfather who had reportedly gone to the event to celebrate the first day of Hanukkah with his wife and grandchildren.He died shielding a family friend who also lost her life. His granddaughter told 9News her family is \"shattered\" by his death.\"Just devastating. Honestly, I&#x27;ve got no words,\" she said.\"And we were just yesterday with him. We had coffee at Bondi Junction with him yesterday. I didn&#x27;t know this was going to be, you know, the last day.\"Dan Elkayam — French engineerDan Elkayam was a 27-year-old engineer from France who had moved to Australia.French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to him after he was killed at Bondi and offered his thoughts to his family.\"It is with deep sadness that I learned of the death of our compatriot Dan Elkayam in the anti-Semitic terrorist attack in Sydney,\" he said in a statement on X.\"My thoughts are with his family and loved ones, and I express to them the full solidarity of the nation.\"French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the country was mourning with Elkayam, and described the shooting as \"despicable\".His partner, Krystal, is \"navigating profound grief while suddenly having to face life on her own\", according to a fundraising site set up by her friends.The fundraising site has raised almost $28,000 for her.The top donation was from the south Sydney football club Elkayam played for, Rockdale Ilinden Football Club, of $2500.Elkayam was a member and player for the team&#x27;s premier league one team.The club said it was in \" extreme shock and sadness\" over the \"horrendous, tragic and senseless events\".\"Dan was an integral member of our PL1 Squad in 2025, who was an extremely talented and popular figure amongst teammates,\" the club said.\"Our deepest and sincerest condolences to Dan&#x27;s family, friends and all that knew him.

It came to a stop atop bodies.\"The footage is truly shocking,\" Judge Andrew Menary said in Liverpool Crown Court.

It shows you deliberately accelerating into groups of fans, time and time again.\"Doyle sobbed during the two-day sentencing as prosecutors detailed the crime, using graphic video footage and reading emotional statements from dozens of victims.Doyle, 54, pleaded guilty last month to 31 counts, including dangerous driving and multiple counts of attempting or causing grievous bodily harm and intentional wounding.Prosecutors said Doyle used his vehicle as a weapon to ram through the sea of people walking toward him following the victory parade.People who scrambled for safety said they feared a terror attack was unfolding.But the explanation was \"as simple as the consequences were awful,\" prosecutor Paul Greaney said. Doyle flew into a fury because he couldn&#x27;t get where he was going fast enough to pick up a family friend who had attended the parade.\"He was a man in a rage, whose anger had completely taken hold of him,\" Greaney said.The judge dismissed Doyle&#x27;s explanation of having panicked as \"demonstrably untrue.\"When Doyle was placed in a police van, he said: \"I&#x27;ve just ruined my family&#x27;s life,\" Greaney said.The impact was far broader.A prosecutor spent hours reading out the statements of victims, some still nursing injuries.A 16-year-old boy kept awake by nightmares lost his apprenticeship as a woodworker because he couldn&#x27;t concentrate. A 23-year-old man had to learn how to walk again. A woman not from the area said the Liverpool accent now triggers anxiety.
