The RFS has said that it is currently too dangerous to assess the damage of the blaze, however, they are expected to do so later this morning. Overnight conditions in that area have not been ideal, so officials have warned that the fire could potentially ramp up again today.\"We&#x27;ve got extreme conditions in seven areas and total fire bans in nine areas,\" Curtin said.Extreme fire danger is forecast in the Greater Hunter, Greater Sydney Region, Illawarra/Shoalhaven, Central Ranges, North Western, Upper Central West Plains and Lower Central West Plains.Severe heatwave warnings are in place for the Hunter, Metropolitan, Illawarra, South Coast, Central Tablelands and Southern Tablelands regions.\"So right through Sydney, Illawarra, Newcastle and through the central parts of the state, we&#x27;ve got extreme fire danger, but we&#x27;ve got high fire danger right across the state.\" This afternoon is expected to bring strong winds before a cooler change is forecast to come later this weekend.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Netflix has struck a deal with Warner Bros Discovery to buy the legacy Hollywood giant&#x27;s studio and streaming business for $US72 billion ($108 billion).The acquisition, announced overnight, would bring two of the industry&#x27;s biggest players in film and TV under one roof. Beyond its namesake television and motion picture division, Warner owns HBO Max and DC Studios. And Netflix has risen to dominance as a household name ubiquitous to on-demand content, while building its own production arm to release popular titles like Stranger Things and Squid Game.The cash and stock deal is valued at $US27.75 per Warner share, giving it a total enterprise value of approximately $US82.7 billion ($124.55 billion). The transaction is expected to close after Warner separates its Discovery Global cable operations into a new publicly-traded company in the third quarter of 2026.READ MORE: Son of high-profile man found guilty of raping woman inside home Shares of Warner Bros rose nearly 3 per cent in premarket trading while shares of Netflix and Paramount fell more than 2 per cent.Gaining Warner&#x27;s legacy studios would mark a notable shift for Netflix&#x27;s current movie theatre footprint. Under the proposed acquisition Netflix has promised to continue theatrical releases for Warner&#x27;s studio films — honouring Warner&#x27;s contractual agreements for movie releases.Netflix has kept most of its original content within its core online platform. But there have been a few exceptions, such as limited theatre screenings of a KPop Demon Hunters sing-a-long and its coming Stranger Things series finale.As recently as October — when Warner signalled that it was open to a potential sale of its business — Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos reiterated on an earnings call that the company had been \"very clear in the past that we have no interest in owning legacy media networks\" and that there was \"no change there\".\"We believe that we can be and we will be choosy,\" Sarandos said at the time, without fully ruling out a potential bid for Warner.READ MORE: Tributes to woman killed by her own dog in South Australian home Friday&#x27;s announcement arrives after a monthslong bidding war for Warner Bros Discovery. Rumours of interest from Netflix, as well as NBC owner Comcast, started bubbling up in the northern hemisphere autumn. But Skydance-owned Paramount, which completed its own $US8 billion merger in August, had also reportedly made several all-cash offers backed heavily by CEO David Ellison&#x27;s family.Paramount seemed like the frontrunner for some time — and unlike Netflix or Comcast, was reportedly vying to buy Warner&#x27;s entire company, including its cable business housing networks like CNN and Discovery.",
