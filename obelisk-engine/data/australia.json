I could spend hours speaking about my brother, about the wonderful person he is, about all the amazing times we had together. But I&#x27;m going to keep this short because I&#x27;m not sure I would be able to get through it without breaking down,\" he said.Senior Constable de Waart-Hottart, was killed alongside his colleague Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson, 59.The hunt for accused double murderer Dezi Freeman is continuing in Victoria&#x27;s high country, with 450 police officers dedicated to the search.Detective Neal Thompson&#x27;s funeral will be held on Monday. De Waart-Hottart had been on secondment to Wangaratta from Melbourne and served Victoria Police for seven years.In a poignant Facebook post earlier this morning, Victoria Police shared a photograph of de Waart-Hottart with an artwork which had been sent to him as a gift of appreciation from a community member some years ago.De Waart-Hottart had attended a mental health incident with a colleague and provided support to that community member when they were in crisis, Victoria Police said.\"As a thank you, that person painted portraits of both officers,\" the post read.\"It&#x27;s a small but powerful reminder of the quiet, positive impact our members have in the community every day â€“ often without recognition or expectation. It&#x27;s through gestures like these that we remember Vadim as someone who devoted his career to helping others.\"Police Association Victoria secretary Wayne Gatt released a statement honouring de Waart-Hottart ahead of the funeral.\"Six years in a job you love is too short. A life that gave more than it took, to have been ended in such a way, is an indescribable injustice and a tragedy,\" Gatt said.\"Senior Constable Vadim de Waart-Hottart, you wore the uniform with honour and you represented it with kindness, compassion and a just heart.\"To your loving family both here and abroad, we want you to know that your loss is shared by the policing family, colleagues and friends of Vadim and an eternally grateful Victorian community.\"Today we farewell Senior Constable Vadim de Waart-Hottart, but we will never forget him.\"Sign up here to receive our daily newsletters and breaking news alerts, sent straight to your inbox.",
