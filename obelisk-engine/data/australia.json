The two people who came from the apartment are now in custody. READ MORE: Federal government issues passport warning to dual citizensClashes in court and on streetsEarlier this week, a judge gave the Trump administration time to respond to a request to suspend its immigration crackdown in Minnesota, while the Pentagon looked for military lawyers to join what has become a chaotic law enforcement effort in the state.Plumes of tear gas, bursts of chemical irritants and the screech of protest whistles have become common on the streets of Minneapolis, especially since Good&#x27;s shooting.Agents have yanked people from cars and homes and been confronted by angry bystanders who are demanding that officers pack up and leave.\"What we need most of all right now is a pause. The temperature needs to be lowered,\" Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said during the first hearing in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St Paul.Local leaders say the government is violating free speech and other constitutional rights with the surge of law enforcement.US District Judge Katherine Menendez promised to keep the case \"on the front burner\" and gave the US Justice Department until Monday to file a response to a request for a restraining order.The judge said these are \"grave and important matters,\" and that there are few legal precedents to apply to some of the key points in the case.Justice Department attorney Andrew Warden suggested the approach set by Menendez was appropriate.The judge is also handling a separate lawsuit challenging the tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal officers when they encounter protesters and observers.A decision could be released this week.During a televised speech Wednesday evening, Governor Tim Walz described Minnesota as being in chaos, saying what&#x27;s happening in the state \"defies belief\".\"Let&#x27;s be very, very clear, this long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement,\" he said.\"Instead, it&#x27;s a campaign of organised brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government.\"Walz added that \"accountability\" will be coming through the courts.READ MORE: The 75 countries Trump is suspending immigrant visas from in latest crackdownMilitary lawyers may join the surgeThe Department of Homeland Security says it has made more than 2000 arrests in the state since early December and is vowing to not back down.The Pentagon is preparing to send military lawyers to Minneapolis to assist.CNN, citing an email circulating in the military, says Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth is asking the branches to identify 40 lawyers known as judge advocate general officers or JAGs, and 25 of them will serve as special assistant US attorneys in Minneapolis.Pentagon spokesperson Kingsley Wilson appeared to confirm the CNN report by posting it on X with a comment that the military \"is proud to support\" the Justice Department.The Pentagon did not immediately respond to emails from The Associated Press seeking more details.It&#x27;s the latest step by the Trump administration to dispatch military and civilian attorneys to areas where federal immigration operations are taking place.The Pentagon last week sent 20 lawyers to Memphis, US Attorney D. Michael Dunavant said.Mark Nevitt, an associate professor at Emory University School of Law and a former Navy JAG, said there&#x27;s concern that the assignments are taking lawyers away from the military justice system.\"There are not many JAGs, but there are over one million members of the military, and they all need legal support,\" he said.READ MORE: Police issue warning after pipe bombs found on Canberra streetsAn official says the agent who killed Good was injuredJonathan Ross, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who killed Good, suffered internal bleeding to his torso during the encounter, a Homeland Security official told The Associated Press.The official spoke to AP on condition of anonymity in order to discuss Ross&#x27; medical condition.The official did not provide details about the severity of the injuries, and the agency did not respond to questions about the extent of the bleeding, exactly how he suffered the injury, when it was diagnosed or his medical treatment.There are many causes of internal bleeding, and they vary in severity from bruising to significant blood loss.Video from the scene showed Ross and other officers walking without obvious difficulty after Good was shot and her Honda Pilot crashed into other vehicles.She was killed after three ICE officers surrounded her SUV on a snowy street a few blocks from her home.Bystander video shows one officer ordering Good to open the door and grab the handle.As the vehicle begins to move forward, Ross, standing in front, raises his weapon and fires at least three shots at close range. He steps back as the SUV advances and turns.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said Ross was struck by the vehicle and that Good was using her SUV as a weapon — a self-defence claim that has been deeply criticised by Minnesota officials.Chris Madel, an attorney for Ross, declined to comment on any injuries.READ MORE: Dual Australian-British citizens caught out by new passport rule&#x27;An agent of peace&#x27;Good&#x27;s family, meanwhile, has hired a law firm, Romanucci & Blandin, that represented George Floyd&#x27;s family in a $US27 million ($40.4 million) settlement with Minneapolis.Floyd, who was Black, died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground in the street in May 2020.The firm said Good was following orders to move her car when she was shot. It said it would conduct its own investigation and publicly share what it learns.\"They do not want her used as a political pawn,\" the firm said, referring to Good and her family, \"but rather as an agent of peace for all.\"Students march against ICEWaving signs reading \"Love Melts ICE\" and \"DE-ICE MN,\" hundreds of teenagers left school in St Paul and marched in freezing temperatures to the state Capitol for a protest and rally.The University of Minnesota, meanwhile, informed its 50,000-plus students that there could be online options for some classes when the new term starts next week.President Rebecca Cunningham noted that \"violence and protests have come to our doorstep\".The campus sits next to the main Somali neighbourhood in Minneapolis.- Reported with AP, CNN DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
