Much of the wealth has been accumulated during the past three years of AI fever.READ MORE: US seizes &#x27;largest ever&#x27; tanker off Venezuela coast, Trump saysIt made sense for Time to anoint AI because 2025 was the year that it shifted from \"a novel technology explored by early adopters to one where a critical mass of consumers see it as part of their mainstream lives,\" Thomas Husson, principal analyst at research firm Forrester, said by email.The magazine noted AI company CEOs&#x27; attendance at US President Donald Trump&#x27;s inauguration this year in Washington DC as a herald for the prominence of the sector.\"This was the year when artificial intelligence&#x27;s full potential roared into view, and when it became clear that there will be no turning back or opting out,\" Jacobs wrote.AI was a leading contender for the top slot, according to prediction markets, along with Huang and Altman. Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope whose election this year followed the death of Pope Francis, was also considered a contender, with Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani topping lists as well.The magazine&#x27;s selection dates from 1927, when its editors have picked the person they say most shaped headlines over the previous 12 months.Sign up here to receive our daily newsletters and breaking news alerts, sent straight to your inbox.",
