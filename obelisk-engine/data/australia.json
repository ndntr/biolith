Communications Minister Amanda Rishworth said it was Ley simply \"shoring up\" her interests locally.She said Ley was hurting Australia&#x27;s reputation as a united front.\"I do think that she has misstepped here,\" Rishworth told Today. \"I think, quite frankly, I think this is more about her shoring up her political survival than it actually is about what&#x27;s in Australia&#x27;s interests.\"Foreign Minister Penny Wong backed Rishworth&#x27;s remarks.She told the ABC&#x27;s Radio National Breakfast that Ley was running a \"rogue foreign policy\" by contradicting Australia&#x27;s official position on Palestine.\"It is possible to back Australia and still be an effective opposition, and really, it&#x27;s time that Ms Ley and the Liberals understood that,\" Wong said. \"We know we&#x27;re strongest when we speak with one voice, we all understand that as Australians, and the opposition should understand that too.\"Albanese addressed the UN General Assembly in New York hours after Australia formally recognised a Palestinian state. \"Working together, we can build a future where instead of children in Gaza dying in pain, living in fear, or being taught to hate - they can go to school, build a &#x27;life in larger freedom&#x27;, aspire to raise children of their own,\" he said earlier today.\"That future depends on recognition being followed by reconstruction and reform.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
