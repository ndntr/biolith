Detective Chief Inspector Paul Albury said responding officers were met with a confronting scene.\"They were met with a pretty horrendous scene,\" he said at a press conference.\"The woman had suffered serious injuries, there were three children inside the home, ranging in age from six to 15.\"He clarified the children were unharmed.READ MORE: Aussie university to offer qualifications for dropouts The man is known to police but not for domestic violence offences.Albury confirmed there was no apprehended violence orde r(AVO) against the man, and that while police had been to the house before, it had not been for a domestic violence incident.About 11am, a 36-year-old man was arrested in a phone box on Camden Valley Way.Albury confirmed the car was found abandoned on Wattle Green Place in Narellan Vale , where a crime scene has been established, less than 2km from the home.He was taken to Narellan Vale Police Station, where he is assisting police, and is expected to be charged this afternoon.Albury said the incident was a reminder of the prevalence and dangers of domestic violence, claiming his precinct responded to a domestic violence call once every two hours in Camden. He said neighbours and witnesses were still reeling from the alleged attack.\"A number of witnesses came to the aid of the woman… those people are deeply shocked by what has occurred,\" he said.\"It&#x27;s a quiet neighbourhood, they are stunned by the level of violence that has been displayed.\"Police are urging anyone with information or dashcam footage from both locations to come forward to Narellan Vale Police Station or to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
