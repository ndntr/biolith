          "content": "One Nation Leader Pauline Hanson has slapped her wrist and stormed out of the Senate today as she was censured over her remarks in a television interview.Labor&#x27;s motion, moved by Foreign Minister Penny Wong, sought to censure the firebrand senator for \"inflammatory and divisive comments seeking to vilify Muslim Australians\" - referencing when she said, \"How can you tell me there are good Muslims?\" on Sky News late last month.Wong said elected officials must \"set the standard for our country and to show basic respect for all Australians\".READ MORE: Chris Minns sets a timeline for his political retirement\"Last week, a man was arrested, alleged to have been planning to attack the Muslim community and mosques, as well as West Australian Police and the Parliament,\" she said.\"These are the real-world consequences of reckless, divisive political stunts that fan the flames of bigotry.\"To claim that none of them are &#x27;good&#x27; is to say that there are no good Australians amongst them, to tell a child that no matter how hard they study, how kindly they treat others, how much they love this country, they will never belong.\"Opposition Senate Leader Michaelia Cash said the Coalition supported the principles of the motion but would not back a censure as it should not be used as a \"routine tactic to score political points\".\"The censure is one of Senate&#x27;s most serious institutional sanctions and it should therefore be rare and sober,\" she said.During the motion&#x27;s hearing, Hanson was caught in a war of words with independent Senator Lidia Thorpe.She then stood up and slapped her own wrist before storming out of the chamber. \"There, are you happy? I&#x27;ve given myself a slap,\" she said.\"This is a joke.\"READ MORE: Trump may have eye on superpower summit in timeline for defeating IranThe motion was passed 36 to 17 with support from the Greens and two Liberals, Paul Scarr and Andrew McLachlan, who crossed the floor.A censure is a formal motion that represents strong disapproval against a politician or government for their actions or performance, but carries no real consequences.Greens Senator Mehreen Faruqi, who supported the motion, said it was \"performative\".\"Let&#x27;s not pretend this is enough,\" she said. This is the second time Hanson has been censured in the span of a few months.She was censured and suspended from the Senate late last year for wearing a burka in the chamber - a repeat of a stunt she pulled in 2017. One Nation has seen a surge in some opinion polls.The minor party is currently on par with the Coalition at 23 per cent of the primary vote for the first time, according to the latest Resolve poll for The Sydney Morning Herald.This is largely attributed to dissatisfied Coalition voters. Meanwhile, Labor still sits comfortably at 32 per cent of the primary vote.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
