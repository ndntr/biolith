          "content": "The US military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that \"aggressively\" approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, the US military said, in an incident first reported by Reuters.The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier \"with unclear intent\" and was shot down by an F-35 US fighter jet, it said.\"An F-35C fighter jet from Abraham Lincoln shot down the Iranian drone in self-defence and to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board,\" said Navy Captain Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson at the US military&#x27;s Central Command.READ MORE: French offices of Elon Musk&#x27;s X platform raided by cybercrime unit No American service members were harmed during the incident and no US equipment was damaged, he added.The incident came as diplomats sought to arrange nuclear talks between Iran and the United States, and US President Donald Trump warned that with US warships heading toward Iran, \"bad things\" would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.The Lincoln carrier strike group is the most visible part of a US military build up in the Middle East following a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month, the deadliest domestic unrest in Iran since its 1979 revolution.Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during the crackdown, has since demanded Tehran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast. He said last week Iran was \"seriously talking,\" while Tehran&#x27;s top security official, Ali Larijani, said arrangements for negotiations were under way.The US military&#x27;s Central Command said in another incident on Tuesday, hours later in the Strait of Hormuz, Iran&#x27;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces harassed a US-flagged, US-crewed merchant vessel.\"Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker,\" Hawkins said.

Markets expect an additional total tightening of 40 basis points this year.The RBA joins the Bank of Japan as the only other developed-world central bank tightening policy at the moment. Markets are still priced for rate cuts in the US, UK and Canada, while the European Central Bank is widely expected to be on an extended pause.Markets had wagered on a 78 per cent probability of a hike given inflation surprised on the high side in the fourth quarter, while unemployment hit a seven-month low in December.The Australian dollar extended earlier gains to be up 0.9 per cent to $US0.7002 while three-year government bond yields jumped 8 basis points to 4.3 per cent.The RBA did not raise interest rates as aggressively as its international peers when inflation was running hot due to its desire to preserve gains in the labour market.That approach may yet test policymakers. The central bank&#x27;s three rate cuts last year saw inflation rear its head again, forcing it to pivot towards a hawkish stance late in 2025 and prompting market bets of an earlier-than-expected start to the tightening cycle.- reported with Reuters NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

          "content": "British police have opened a criminal investigation into politician Peter Mandelson over alleged misconduct related to his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The UK government says newly released Epstein files suggest Mandelson – a former Cabinet minister, ambassador and elder statesman of the governing Labour Party – may have shared market-sensitive information with the convicted sex offender a decade and a half ago.London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police force said detectives had reviewed reports of misconduct and decided they met the threshold for a full investigation.READ MORE: US shoots down Iranian drone &#x27;aggressively&#x27; approaching aircraft carrier Commander Ella Marriott said the force \"has now launched an investigation into a 72-year-old man, a former government minister, for misconduct in public office offences.\"Misconduct in public office carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Opening an investigation does not mean Mandelson will be arrested, charged or convicted.But his friendship with Epstein has now cost him his political career. Mandelson said overnight he was resigning from the House of Lords, Parliament&#x27;s upper chamber, to which he was appointed for life in 2008.READ MORE: French offices of Elon Musk&#x27;s X platform raided by cybercrime unit The Speaker of the Lords, Michael Forsyth, said Mandelson had informed officials he will retire effective Wednesday.The announcement came as the British government prepared legislation to eject Mandelson from the Lords and remove the noble title, Lord Mandelson, that came with his seat in the chamber.Mandelson will retain the title after he retires unless lawmakers pass legislation to strip it from him – something that has not been done for more than a century.READ MORE: Son of Norway&#x27;s crown princess pleads not guilty to rape charges as his trial opens A trove of more than three million pages of Epstein-related documents released by the US Justice Department has brought excruciating revelations about 72-year-old Mandelson, who served in senior government roles under previous Labour governments and was UK ambassador to Washington until Prime Minister Keir Starmer fired him in September over his ties to Epstein.The newly released files contain emails from Mandelson to Epstein passing on nuggets of political information, some of which critics say may have broken the law.Starmer told his Cabinet on Tuesday that he was \"appalled\" by the revelations in newly released Epstein files, and was concerned there are more details still to emerge.Starmer spokesman Tom Wells said that the government had sent police its assessment that the Mandelson-Epstein documents contained \"likely market-sensitive information\" about the 2008 global financial crisis and its aftermath that shouldn&#x27;t have been shared outside of government.In 2003-2004, bank documents suggest Epstein sent three payments totaling US$75,000 ($107,003) to accounts linked to Mandelson or his partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva. Mandelson has said that he doesn&#x27;t remember receiving the money and will investigate whether the documents are authentic. But he resigned from the governing Labour Party on Sunday, saying he didn&#x27;t want to cause the party \"further embarrassment.\"In 2008, Epstein avoided federal prosecution by pleading guilty to state charges in Florida of soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail.Emails and text messages show that Mandelson&#x27;s friendship with Epstein continued after the financier&#x27;s sentence.In 2009, Epstein sent da Silva £10,000 pounds ($19,527) to pay for an osteopathy course. Mandelson told The Times of London that \"in retrospect, it was clearly a lapse in our collective judgment for Reinaldo to accept this offer.\"Also in 2009, Mandelson, then business secretary in the UK government, appears to have told Epstein he would lobby other members of the government to reduce a tax on bankers&#x27; bonuses.The same year, Mandelson sent Epstein an internal government report discussing ways the UK could raise money after the 2008 global financial crisis, including by selling off government assets. Mandelson wrote: \"Interesting note that&#x27;s gone to the PM.\"In May 2010, Mandelson messaged Epstein that \"sources tell me 500 b euro bailout\" is almost complete. The message was dated hours before day European governments announced a €500 billion ($842.42 billion) deal to shore up the single currency.Epstein died by suicide in a jail cell in 2019, while awaiting trial on US federal charges accusing him of sexually abusing dozens of girls.Health Secretary Wes Streeting said that Mandelson&#x27;s friendship with Epstein was \"a betrayal on so many levels.\"\"It is a betrayal of the victims of Jeffrey Epstein that he continued that association and that friendship for so long after his conviction,\" Streeting told the BBC.\"It is a betrayal of not just one but two prime ministers\" – Gordon Brown, the UK leader between 2007 and 2010, and Starmer.An email requesting comment on the documents was sent to Mandelson through the House of Lords.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

There is an extreme fire danger warning and a total fire ban in place for tomorrow with winds set to increase across the Mount Lofty Ranges, which includes the fire ground on the Fleurieu Peninsula.&#x27;You could see red across the hill&#x27;The skies above Deep Creek were a crimson red on Monday night, prompting some residents to start packing their bags.\"You could see red across the hill, so Deep Creek was burning.
