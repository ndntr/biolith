Haydon, who grew up on the NSW Central Coast, accompanied the prime minister throughout his 2022 and 2025 election campaigns.Albanese proposed to Haydon on Valentine&#x27;s Day last year, making him the first Australian prime minister to get engaged while in office.The pair kept plans for their nuptials tightly under wraps, largely for security reasons due to rising concerns around political violence across Australia.In August, the PM revealed the ceremony would be a small affair, with no international figures on the guest list.\"It&#x27;s not a political event. It&#x27;s an event between myself and Jodie,\" Albanese told Brisbane radio station B105.Albanese has spoken in the past about the moment he decided Haydon was the woman he wanted to marry.\"This,\" he told the reporter while gesturing towards The Lodge, \"will end one day, and the thing about our relationship is that we enjoy spending time together. Just us. So, when it became clear to me that Jodie was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, and that I couldn&#x27;t imagine a life without her, I made the decision.\"Before popping the question on Valentine&#x27;s Day last year, Albanese said he first spoke to Nathan, his son.\"I respect him and have a good relationship with him, and with his mother. So I asked him to think about it, and then he came back to me and Nathan was supportive. He wants me to be happy, and Nathan and Jodie have a really nice relationship as well.\"",

          "content": "President Donald Trump on Saturday said that the airspace “above and surrounding” Venezuela should be considered as “closed in its entirety,” an assertion that raised more questions about the US pressure on Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.His government accused Trump of making a ”colonial threat\" and seeking to undermine the South American country&#x27;s sovereignty.The White House did not respond to questions about what Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, and it was unclear whether he was announcing a new policy or simply reinforcing the messaging around his campaign against Maduro, which has involved multiple strikes in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean on small boats accused of ferrying drugs as well as a buildup of naval forces in the region.READ MORE: Massive industrial fire in Sydney&#x27;s west could burn for days More than 80 people have been killed in such strikes since early September.The Republican president addressed his call for an aerial blockade to “Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers,” rather than to Maduro.Venezuela’s government said it “forcefully rejects” Trump’s claim about closing the airspace and that it was a “colonial threat” intended to undermine the country&#x27;s \"territorial integrity, aeronautical security and full sovereignty.”The Foreign Ministry said “such declarations constitute a hostile, unilateral and arbitrary act.”The statement also said that US immigration authorities had unilaterally suspended biweekly deportation flights of Venezuelan migrants.Following negotiations between the two governments, more than 13,000 Venezuelans have been deported to Venezuela this year on dozens of chartered flights, the latest of which arrived late Friday in Caracas, the capital, according to flight-tracking data.READ MORE: Teething issues as Melbourne Metro Tunnel finally opens after years of delays International airlines last week began to cancel flights to Venezuela after the Federal Aviation Administration told pilots to be cautious flying around the country because of heightened military activity.The FAA’s jurisdiction is generally limited to the United States and its territories.The agency does routinely warn pilots about the dangers of flying over areas with ongoing conflicts or military activity around the globe, as it did earlier this month with Venezuela.READ MORE: Trump hints at decision on Venezuela - is the US about to go to war? The FAA works with other countries and the International Civil Aviation Organization on international issues.The FAA and ICAO did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday.Trump&#x27;s administration has sought to ratchet up pressure on Maduro.The US government does not view Maduro as the legitimate leader of the oil-rich but increasingly impoverished South American nation and he faces charges of narcoterrorism in the US.US forces have conducted bomber flights near Venezuela and the USS Gerald R. Ford, America&#x27;s most advanced aircraft carrier, was sent to the area.The Ford rounds off the largest buildup of US firepower in the region in generations. With its arrival, the “Operation Southern Spear” mission includes nearly a dozen Navy ships and about 12,000 sailors and Marines.READ MORE: Delays expected again for Jetstar passengers as airlines race to fix Airbus planesThere are bipartisan calls for greater oversight of the US military strikes against vessels in the region after The Washington Post reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order for all crew members to be killed as part of the Sept. 2 attack on suspected drug smugglers.Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and its top Democrat, Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, said in a joint statement late on Friday that the committee \"will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.”Trump’s team has weighed both military and nonmilitary options with Venezuela, including covert action by the CIA.Trump has publicly floated the idea of talking to Maduro.The New York Times reported on Friday that Trump and Maduro had spoken.The White House declined to answer questions about the conversation.",
