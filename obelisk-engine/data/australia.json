          "content": "Barnaby Joyce has snubbed the Nationals, but insists he is still a member of the regional party as his future in politics remains in limbo.The former deputy prime minister skipped a party room meeting today as he considers leaving the Nationals over its stance on net zero and Pauline Hanson&#x27;s invitation to join her right-wing party One Nation.\" I&#x27;m not going to attend any party room that believes in net zero,\" he told reporters in Canberra. READ MORE: Microsoft Australia allegedly misled millions of Aussies: watchdogWhile he missed the meeting, Joyce said he would still sit with the regional party in parliament when it resumed today.Joyce has refused to speculate on the \"hypotheticals\" of his political future, but ruled out running as an independent.He also confirmed he was still a member of the Nationals for now, and suggested he may remain with the party if it dumps its net-zero target.\"I&#x27;ll see what they come up with,\" he said. The Nationals are reviewing their position on net zero by 2050, which Joyce has so adamantly opposed that he declared earlier this month his relationship with party leadership had \"irreparably broken down\" and he would not recontest his seat of New England at the next election.Joyce&#x27;s own bill opposing net zero will be going before parliament today.Nationals leader David Littleproud told Sky News the party would not decide its stance on net zero today, adding that it must come up with an alternative climate plan if it is to drop the target.\"I get that takes time, but I&#x27;d rather do it right and be able to look the Australian people in the eye. And we encourage Barnaby to be part of that solution,\" he said.READ MORE: New financial &#x27;pain&#x27; coming for Aussies - but there&#x27;s a silver liningHe said that while he wants Joyce to remain in the party, but would not offer up a seat on the frontbench to entice him back.Instead, he said the party has to \"create an environment\" where Joyce feels \"welcome and wants to come back and contribute\". \"I&#x27;ve made it very clear to him that he&#x27;s welcome back at any time, and he can make a constructive contribution with the rest of the party room,\" he said.\"He needs only to walk in and talk to the room.\"Joyce confirmed he had spoken to Littleproud.\" I&#x27;ve had a brief and courteous conversation with him. It went for about three minutes,\" he said.At the same time, Joyce said he would also be meeting with Hanson, who invited him to join her party upon news of his relationship breakdown with the Nationals.\"I&#x27;ll meet with Pauline Hanson. I&#x27;ve met with Pauline Hanson before. I mean, this is a free country. You&#x27;re allowed to actually meet other people. I talk to people from the Greens,\" he said.If Joyce defects to One Nation, he could take other dissatisfied colleagues with him, giving Hanson a major win and deepening the rift within the Coalition.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Following an investigation prompted by tip-offs and Reddit posts, the consumer watchdog believes millions of Australians have suffered economic harm.The ACCC is seeking orders including penalties, injunctions, declarations, consumer redress, and costs in court.Corporations in breach of consumer law could face a maximum penalty of $50 million.Microsoft said it is reviewing the ACCC&#x27;s claim and will work to ensure its practices are legal and ethical.\" Consumer trust and transparency are top priorities for Microsoft, and we are reviewing the ACCC&#x27;s claim in detail,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said.\"We remain committed to working constructively with the regulator and ensuring our practices meet all legal and ethical standards.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
