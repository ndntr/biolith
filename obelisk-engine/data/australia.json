          "content": "A former hospital nurse has been found guilty of murdering Toyah Cordingley, seven years after the young woman&#x27;s body was found on an isolated beach.Cordingley, 24, was discovered by her father half-buried in an isolated section of sand dunes in far north Queensland on October 22, 2018.Rajwinder Singh, 41 was charged in March 2023 accused of fatally stabbing Cordingley at Wangetti Beach, north of Cairns.He had pleaded not guilty to murder at the four-week trial before Justice Lincoln Crowley at Cairns&#x27; Supreme Court.The jury reached a verdict at the retrial this afternoon after about seven hours of deliberating.It came nine months after a jury was unable to reach a verdict following days of deliberations at Singh&#x27;s first trial.On October 21, 2018 Cordingley drove to the beach about 40km north of Cairns for a Sunday afternoon walk with her dog.Her family raised the alarm later that evening when she didn&#x27;t return.Her body was found about 800m from her car while her dog was unharmed and tied up to a tree.Police claimed Cordingley had died after \"a personal and intimate attack\".The tragedy rocked the laidback community, with hand-made posters soon appearing appealing for information and online tributes pouring in for the \"gentle, humble and loving\" Cordingley.Around 350 people packed a small chapel in the Cairns suburb of Manunda for her funeral.A record $1 million reward was offered by Queensland Police in late 2022 for information leading to the location and arrest of runaway suspect Singh.Police believed Singh flew to India soon after Cordingley&#x27;s body was found, leaving his wife and children behind at Innisfail near Cairns.Weeks after the reward was announced, Singh was arrested in New Delhi.He was extradited to Australia and charged with murder in March 2023.Singh had earlier waived his right to challenge the extradition order, telling AAP in New Delhi: \"I want to go back. It is the (Indian) judicial system that has been holding things up.\"\"I did not kill the woman,\" he said, adding he wanted to \"reveal all the details\" to an Australian court.Queensland Police later confirmed the $1 million reward had been paid to a number of people.\"We appreciate the significant public interest in this matter however, information provided on the process is limited as it is obtained on a confidential basis.\"As such we will not reveal specifics of the reward only to advise it has been paid in full to a number of claimants.\"",

Poured beer over his hair, pulled his shirt, the beer was burning his eyes, pulled his shoulders, there are bruises all over him, and just absolutely humiliated him,\" she told Ben Fordham&#x27;s 2GB breakfast show today.\"They were laughing and taunting him, calling him disgusting names that I don&#x27;t think he will ever forget.\"She said her son made sure not to fall over in the tunnel as he feared he would never get back up. Footage of what appears to be the alleged incident showed the 17-year-old walking through the tunnel while he was slapped and hit, yelled at, his shirt was pulled in all directions, and beer was poured over him.He managed to run away but was chased by some boys until a nearby woman who witnessed what happened took him to her house.There, he called his mother and the police. \"When you get a phone call when you&#x27;re at work with your son screaming and telling you what had happened? To be honest, I couldn&#x27;t believe it,\" she said.Police said they were told a group of boys had allegedly assaulted the 17-year-old boy.\"Officers attached to Eastern Suburbs Police Area Command have commenced an investigation after a 17-year-old boy was allegedly assaulted at a sports ground in Manion Ave, Rose Bay,\" a police spokesperson said.\" The boy sustained no injuries.\"READ MORE: Stunning images show shark feeding frenzy off NSW beachThe Scots College, a Presbyterian day and boarding school for prep to year 12 boys, describes itself as an \"Australian school that defends the honourable traditions, adventures and learning of boys\".It is deemed one of the country&#x27;s oldest and most exclusive boys&#x27; schools, with fees for year 12 students exceeding $46,000 a year.Principal Ian Lambert said he was \"disappointed and disgusted\" with the alleged actions.\"The conduct that has been reported, and which appears in video evidence, is completely unacceptable and stands in direct opposition to the values of The Scots College,\" he said in a statement.\"I am disappointed and disgusted. The fact that the incident occurred off campus and outside school hours does not lessen its seriousness. Behaviour of this nature is never tolerated at Scots.\"It does not reflect the character of our student body and will not define who we are or the values we uphold.\"Lambert said he is conducting an internal investigation and will take action against the students involved if found guilty.The school is also providing support for the 17-year-old affected and his family and helping police with their investigation.\"The college will not make further comment while the NSW Police investigation or the college investigation is ongoing,\" Lambert said.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

The 63-year-old male driver of the car has been taken to hospital with injuries, where he remains under police guard. The driver is yet to be formally interviewed by police.It remains unclear what exactly caused the crash. Detective Inspector Craig McEvoy said the car, a silver Alfa Romeo, did not appear to brake before it smashed 30-metres into the medical centre.\"Nothing has suggested to me that the design or the infrastructure of the intersection has contributed to it in any way,\" McEvoy added.He said it was fortunate the car missed the waiting room and reception area.McEvoy said the pedestrian who was killed was sadly in the \"wrong place at the wrong time\". \"It&#x27;s the Christmas period, slow down. Take care,\" he added. \"Slow down, enjoy time with your loved ones.\"The intersection of Keilor Road and Hoffmans Road has been closed to traffic and trams in all directions following the crash.Police said the road will reopen later this afternoon.
