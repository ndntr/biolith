Get off,\" the teen said while on the politician&#x27;s bed.Ward replied: \"No, relax. You know I&#x27;ll give you a massage.\"Two years later, Ward sexually assaulted an intoxicated political staffer at his own inner-city apartment after a mid-week event at NSW Parliament House.READ MORE: Millions facing storms &#x27;every day&#x27; for nearly a weekThe man, who was 24 at the time, said Ward climbed into bed with him, groped his backside and sexually assaulted him despite him repeatedly saying \"no\".He testified to the jury that he was uncomfortable and felt \"a jolt kind of pain\".After reports, police were investigating sexual crime allegations in 2021, Ward was removed from his position as minister for families, communities and disability services and shifted to the crossbench.His personal vote was so significant he was re-elected as an independent during the 2023 election despite the charges hanging over his head.Ward resigned from his position in August, hours before a parliamentary expulsion vote was due to take place.In doing so, he narrowly avoided becoming the fifth person expelled from NSW parliament in two centuries.Support is available from the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service at 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732).",

Ganiev was then committed to stand trial after formally pleading not guilty to the murder of Bell.READ MORE: Israel receives remains of two deceased hostages held in Gaza Mykytowycz also committed his co-accused Eyal Yaffe to trial on the charges of assisting an offender and attempting to pervert the course of justice.Prosecutors claim Yaffe helped move the fridge that contained Bell&#x27;s remains after the alleged murder.The two men will face a pre-trial directions hearing in the Supreme Court on November 18.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
