And that&#x27;s a huge concern because then the perception becomes reality and people feel unsafe in their own community.\"\"We&#x27;ve had 25 to 30 victims under the age of 25 who have died in the knife crisis here in Victoria, and they [the government] continue to have their head in the sand and won&#x27;t answer the real questions of fixing the bail system, bringing in something like break bail, face jail and ensuring we have violent offenders off the street.\"Battin said if the Liberals were returned to government, he would put laws in place that bar courts from granting bail to some offenders.\"One of the key points is &#x27;break bail, face jail&#x27;. Those that are committing violent offences shouldn&#x27;t continue to get bail,\" he said.READ MORE: Search resumes for missing 26-year-old fisherman\"We&#x27;ll ensure we&#x27;ll tighten the laws to make sure that the judges don&#x27;t have the choice to give them bail, that they have to keep them on remand rather than back out into the community.\"Battin&#x27;s comments come as senior police in Victoria call for greater government support.Victoria Police Commander Wayne Cheeseman claimed the department was having to draft in police officers from regional areas of the state to police protests in Melbourne CBD.One such protest last week left two police officers in hospital.Battin said he would also increase funding to the state&#x27;s police, claiming the overstretched department was equipped enough to deal with crime in Victoria.READ MORE: Louvre jewellery heist investigators make a stunning claim\"Mike Bush [Victoria&#x27;s chief police commissioner] has got over 1100 vacancies on the roster,\" Battin claimed.\"He can&#x27;t just invent police, he needs funding to ensure they get there.\"Battin said until the issue is fixed, a growing number of Victorians will not feel safe in their own home.\"It is getting to a stage that this is the only topic people are talking about,\" he said.\"And that&#x27;s a huge concern because then the perception becomes reality and people feel unsafe in their own community.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Trump negotiated the deal in his first term, but has since soured on it.Trump and Carney will both attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia. But Trump told reporters traveling with him that he had no intention of meeting Carney there.Trump said the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president and a beloved figure in the Republican Party. But Reagan was wary of tariffs and used much of the 1987 address featured in Ontario&#x27;s ad spelling out the case against tariffs.Trump has complained the ad was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of arguments scheduled for next month that could decide whether Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy.Lower courts had ruled he had exceeded his authority.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
