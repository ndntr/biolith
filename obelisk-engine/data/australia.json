CCTV footage of alleged shooter Julian Ingram reporting for bail at a police station hours before three people were found dead in a town in NSW&#x27;s central west has been released by police.The footage comes as the search for the alleged Lake Cargelligo gunman nears one week. Police have today revealed they believe the 37-year-old is still alive and possibly being assisted by someone.

Quinn was heavily pregnant and was due to give birth in March.Shortly after, police responded to a second shooting at Walker Street in the same town.Police found a 50-year-old woman and 19-year-old man shot in the driveway of a home.The woman, who has been named as Sophie&#x27;s aunt Nerida Quinn, died at the scene, while the man was taken to Canberra Hospital in a serious but stable condition.Ingram is described as being Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander appearance, about 165cm-170cm tall, with a medium build, short dark hair and brown eyes.The 37-year-old also has several tattoos on his arms.Anyone who sees Ingram is being urged not to approach him and to contact police immediately.

I won&#x27;t do it,\" Griffiths replied, before placing the lighter near the ground and setting Sheahan alight.Flames spread to his 16-year-old stepdaughter and to Griffiths, who extinguished the fire on himself before helping his wife.Sheahan was dragged to the bathroom, given a cold shower and then Griffiths took her outside and sprayed his wife with a hose.READ MORE: Melbourne youth gang members on notice after police warningThe children who were trapped inside the house, including a 10-month-old and a two-year-old, were rescued by their older siblings before the entire home caught fire.Emergency services heard Griffiths blaming Sheahan for the fire and telling her: \"Why didn&#x27;t you stop me, you should&#x27;ve stopped me and I should be in jail\".The woman, who was in the early stages of dying, lied to police for him, saying Griffiths tried to light himself on fire and when she tried to stop him she caught fire too.Sheahan was taken to hospital with burns to 91 per cent of her body, but she died on March 18, 2022, four days after the blaze.The day Griffiths was supposed to face trial, in February 2025, he indicated he wanted to plead guilty to murder and recklessly causing injury to his stepchild.Justice John Champion labelled the murder a brutal example of the offence and pointed out his taunting of his victims who must have been \"terrified\".He noted Griffiths&#x27; victim blaming of Sheahan after the offending was \"particularly repugnant\".\"I make it clear that Ms Sheahan was completely blameless, innocent and did not deserve the treatment you meted out to her at all,\" the judge said.\"Your attack on Ms Sheahan was grievously inappropriate.\"Justice Champion jailed Griffiths for life, with 32 years to serve before he is eligible for parole.Griffiths has spent more than 1300 days in custody as he has been in jail since his arrest in March 2022.National Sexual Assault, Domestic Family Violence Counselling Service 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732).",

That possibility must be taken extremely seriously, not avoided or downplayed,\" she said.The Greens&#x27; First Nations justice co-spokesperson Jess Beckerling criticised the \"soft language and low-level charge\" by police.WA Police said they could not comment as the matter was before the court. But Australian Strategic Policy Institute national security program director John Coyne explained that police needed to prove \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" that the motivation was to commit terror and for the device to detonate in order to make a declaration.\"Some people will say it&#x27;s self-evident,\" he said.\"The police and the prosecutors will need to be able to go into a courtroom and prove beyond reasonable doubt that their motivation was to create terror and fear based on an ideology.\"That takes a while to gather that sort of information.\"READ MORE: CCTV shows alleged shooter hours before triple murder as manhunt nears one-week markCoyne said there was an air of caution to declare an incident terrorism and pointed to the bombs found inside a caravan in Dural, Sydney, in January last year.The incident was declared terrorism, but police later found the caravan never intended to detonate and was created to sow fear. \" We want to make sure that the decision is made with as much information as possible. We don&#x27;t want to potentially derail future prosecutions. We don&#x27;t want to have undue worry in the community,\" Coyne said.Police alleged the \"rudimentary\" bomb thrown in Perth contained ball bearings and screws, which were wrapped around a liquid in a glass container.Officers arrested the man, who allegedly indicated the device may contain explosives. It failed to detonate, but the crowd was evacuated. No one was injured.The 31-year-old has been remanded in custody and will face the Perth Magistrates Court on February 17.The accused&#x27;s identity has been suppressed by the court due to concerns for his safety.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
