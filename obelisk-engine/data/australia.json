          "content": "The man accused of fatally attacking former Labor strategist Tim Picton has been slapped with a manslaughter charge, as his lawyer foreshadows a bail application.A rowdy group of about 20 family and supporters packed Perth Magistrates Court today for Brodie Jake Dewar&#x27;s appearance via video-link from Hakea Prison.The slight 20-year-old is accused of attacking Picton, 36, outside a bar in Northbridge, in Perth&#x27;s inner city, in the early hours of December 27.READ MORE: Gus Lamont&#x27;s grandparents &#x27;devastated&#x27; after missing boy case declared major crimePicton, who has been lauded as a brilliant political tactician, died in hospital several weeks later after hitting his head on the pavement during the alleged altercation with Dewar.His death triggered an outpouring of grief from his family, friends and colleagues, as tributes flowed from the prime minister, several premiers and business leaders.Picton had advised state and federal politicians, and helped guide WA Labor to a landslide 2021 election victory.Dewar was originally charged with grievous bodily harm over the incident that was recorded on CCTV, but this has been upgraded to unlawfully killing.He was not required to enter a plea and only spoke to confirm his identity and that he understood the charge.Dewar was grim-faced for most of the hearing, during which angry shouts from some of his supporters denied entry to the court could be heard from the corridor outside.His lawyer, Simon Watters, pushed for the court to hear a bail application.READ MORE: Man charged with abusing hundreds of kids to remain behind bars He said Dewar was in custody for a grievous bodily harm charge stemming from an incident on Christmas Day in the Perth suburb of Kalamunda.He said Dewar had been previously granted bail on that charge, which is yet to be discontinued by prosecutors, and he would seek to have that extended to the manslaughter offence.Watters said the two matters were separate incidents, as he argued Dewar&#x27;s bid for bail should be heard.He also said Dewar was likely to appeal to the Supreme Court over the December 25 charge, although it was not clear why.The police prosecutor said he wasn&#x27;t prepared for a bail application and didn&#x27;t have a copy of the CCTV video of the incident involving Picton to play for the court.Magistrate Benjamin White noted that a magistrate at the Armadale court, which previously heard Dewar&#x27;s December 25 charge, had stated the prosecution had a strong case due to the video footage of the alleged incident and a term of imprisonment was possible.Watters said the Armadale magistrate had not seen full CCTV video recording of the altercation, which allegedly involved Dewar, a man and a woman.White could not be swayed and said he would hear Dewar&#x27;s bail application next Friday.Watters said he would make submissions about Picton&#x27;s interaction with Dewar&#x27;s cousin on December 27, although it was not clear whether they would be oral submissions during the hearing or written.After White adjourned the matter, several of Dewar&#x27;s supporters shouted out: \"We love you Brodie\".He made the sign of a heart with his hands in reply.",
