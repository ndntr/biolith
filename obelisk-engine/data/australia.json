          "content": "President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he wants a global tariff of 15 per cent, up from 10 per cent he had announced a day earlier after the US Supreme Court struck down many of the far-reaching taxes on imports that he had imposed over the last year.Trump’s announcement on social media was the latest sign that despite the court&#x27;s check on his powers, the Republican president still intends to ratchet up tariffs in an unpredictable way.Tariffs have been his favourite tool for rewriting the rules of global commerce and applying international pressure.READ MORE: Trump&#x27;s rant after Supreme Court strikes down his key policy READ MORE: Trump orders release of government files on existence of aliens The court&#x27;s decision on Friday struck down tariffs that Trump had imposed on nearly every country using an emergency powers law.Trump now said he will use a different, albeit more limited, legal authority.He&#x27;s already signed an executive order enabling him to bypass Congress and impose a 10 per cent tax on imports from around the world, starting on Tuesday, the same day as his State of the Union speech.However, those tariffs are limited to 150 days unless they are extended legislatively.The White House did not immediately respond to a message inquiring when the president would sign an updated order to peg the tariffs at 15 per cent.He wrote on social media that he was making the announcement “based on a thorough, detailed, and complete review of the ridiculous, poorly written, and extraordinarily anti-American decision on Tariffs issued yesterday.\"By a 6-3 vote, the justices ruled that it was unconstitutional for Trump to unilaterally set and change tariffs because the power to tax lies with Congress.READ MORE: Donald Trump says Andrew&#x27;s arrest &#x27;very, very sad to me&#x27;READ MORE: TV host lashes his own network for stopping interview being aired In addition to the temporary tariffs that Trump wants to set at 15 per cent, the president said on Friday that he was also pursuing tariffs through other sections of federal law which require an investigation by the Commerce Department.He wrote on Saturday that “during the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again.”After the Supreme Court decision, Trump made an unusually personal attack on the justices who ruled against him in a 6-3 vote, including two of those he appointed during his first term, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett.Trump, at a news conference on Friday, said that the situation is \"an embarrassment to their families.\"He was still seething on Friday night, posting on social media complaining about Gorsuch, Coney Barrett and Chief Justice John Roberts, who ruled with the majority and wrote the majority opinion.On Saturday morning, Trump issued another post declaring that his “new hero” was Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote a 63-page dissent.He also praised Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, who were in the minority, and said of the three dissenting justices: \"There is no doubt in anyone’s mind that they want to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"Tariffs have been central to Trump’s economic policies, which he has said address a host of ills, from reviving trade imbalances and reviving US manufacturing to forcing other nations to action, whether it be stepping up efforts to combat drug trafficking or ceasing hostilities with each other.He also regularly claimed despite evidence to the contrary that foreign governments would pay the tariffs, not American consumers and businesses.Federal data shows the Treasury had collected more than $US133 billion ($187 billion) from the import taxes the president has imposed under the emergency powers law as of December, and Trump has made many promises about what that money might go toward, such as paying down the national debt and sending dividend checks to taxpayers.The Supreme Court decision did not address what happens to the funds that have already been collected from tariffs.Democrats spoke out quickly on Trump&#x27;s new tariff threat.Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee accused Trump of “pickpocketing the American people” with his newly announced higher tariff.“A little over 24 hours after his tariffs were ruled illegal, he’s doing anything he can to make sure he can still jack up your costs,” they wrote on social media.California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, a Trump nemesis, added that \"he does not care about you.”NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

          "content": "Crews have recovered the bodies of nine backcountry skiers who were killed in a California avalanche four days ago, authorities said yesterday, concluding a harrowing operation hindered by intense snowfall.A search team reached the bodies of eight victims and found one other who had been missing and presumed dead since Tuesday’s avalanche on Castle Peak near Lake Tahoe.The ninth person who was missing was found “relatively close” to the other victims, according to Nevada County Sheriff’s Lt. Dennis Hack, but it was impossible to see them because there were white-out conditions on Tuesday when the others were located.READ MORE: Police probe burnt-out car as search for missing grandfather Chris Baghsarian continuesAt a news conference yesterday, Nevada County Sheriff Shannon Moon praised the collective efforts of the numerous agencies who helped recover the victims, including the 42 volunteers who helped on the last day of the operation.“We are fortunate in this mountain community that we are very tight-knit, and our community shows up in times of tragedy,” Moon said.Victims namedThe sheriff named for the first time on Saturday the three guides for the Blackbird Mountain Company who were killed in the avalanche. They are Andrew Alissandratos, 34, Nicole Choo, 42, and Michael Henry, 30.Alissandratos was originally from Tampa, Florida, but moved to Tahoe about a decade ago, according to his biography on the guide website, Blackbird Mountain Company.He enjoyed a wide array of adventure, like split-boarding and rock climbing.Henry moved to Colorado in 2016, and then to Truckee three years later, the site said. He is described as “laid back” and eager to share his knowledge and love of the mountains with others.There was no bio for Choo on the website on Saturday.“This was an enormous tragedy, and the saddest event our team has ever experienced,\" Blackbird Mountain Guides founder Zeb Blais wrote in a statement on Wednesday.“We are doing what we can to support the families who lost so much, and the members of our team who lost treasured friends and colleagues.\"READ MORE: US President Donald Trump says he&#x27;ll raise tariffs to 15 percent after Supreme Court ruling The six others killed were women who were part of a close-knit group of friends who were experienced backcountry skiers and knew how to navigate the wilderness of California’s Sierra Nevada, their families said on Thursday.Two of the friends got out alive and were rescued along with four others, including one guide, after Tuesday’s avalanche.“We are devastated beyond words,” the families said in a statement released through a spokesperson.“Our focus right now is supporting our children through this incredible tragedy and honouring the lives of these extraordinary women. They were all mothers, wives and friends, all of whom connected through the love of the outdoors.”The six killed lived in the Bay Area, Idaho and near Lake Tahoe.They are Carrie Atkin, Liz Clabaugh, Danielle Keatley, Kate Morse, Caroline Sekar and Kate Vitt, the families said, asking for privacy as they grieve. They added that they “have many unanswered questions.” They were all in their 40s.Stuck on the mountain for hoursThe tragedy began about 11:30 am on Tuesday when six survivors called for help, describing a sudden and terrifying avalanche that was approximately the length of a football field.In the aftermath of the snowfall, those survivors had discovered the bodies of three deceased skiers nearby, according to Hack.It was the last day of the three-day tour in the stunning and remote Sierra Nevada, and the group of 15 skiers decided to end the trip early to avoid the impending snowstorm.There were 11 skiers and four guides. Officials described the path that the group was taking as a “normally travelled route” but declined to specify what that meant.Initial reports indicated that at least two people in the group did not get swept away, Hack said.The others were standing separately and relatively close together and were hit with the avalanche.Hack declined to offer more information about what might have set off the avalanche.First responders weren&#x27;t able to reach them until roughly six hours after the initial call for help, Hack said, and were forced to take two separate paths.The rescue teams also found the bodies of five others, leaving only one unaccounted for.But it was immediately clear to rescuers that it was too dangerous to extract the bodies of the victims at that time due to the heavy snowfall and threat of more avalanches.Those conditions persisted on Wednesday and Thursday, as the families of victims waited for the bad weather to abate.Breakthrough on FridayOfficials used two helicopters belonging to the California Highway Patrol, with the help of Pacific Gas and Electric company, to break up the snow in the area to intentionally release unstable snowpack to reduce the risk of another avalanche for rescue crews.The state highway agency was able to recover five victims that evening before it got too dark to access the last three.Helicopters with the California National Guard and California Highway Patrol recovered the final four bodies yesterday morning with helicopters by hoisting them from the mountain with ropes, fighting through severe winds that forced the agencies to make multiple trips.The bodies were then taken to nearby snowcats — trucks that are outfitted to be able to drive on snow.“We cannot say enough how tremendously sorry we are for the families that has been affected by this avalanche,” Moon said.Land will reopen in MarchThe area will be closed to visitors until mid-March, said Chris Feutrier, the forest supervisor for the Tahoe National Forest.But he said that officials fully intended on restoring public access as soon as the investigation is complete.“This is the public’s land, and they love to recreate on it,” Feutrier said.“The Forest Service doesn’t close public land for every hazard or every obstacle. We trust the American people to use their best judgment when recreating.”",
