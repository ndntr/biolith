          "content": "NSW Police have charged two men over the alleged kidnapping and murder of Chris Baghsarian, after remains found on Tuesday were positively identified as the Sydney grandfather.Baghsarian, 85, who disappeared from his North Ryde home shortly before 5am on Friday, February 13, was the victim of a mistaken-identity abduction, police say.Daniel Stevens, 24, and Gerard Andrews, 29, were taken into custody yesterday morning and charged last night over the alleged murder and kidnapping. Police will allege in court that the men \"participated in a joint criminal enterprise with other persons\" that led to Baghsarian&#x27;s death.READ MORE: Queensland pub owner&#x27;s plea after being forced to raise menu priceshttps://omny.fm/shows/ben-fordham-full-show/exclusive-police-questioning-2-men-over-death-of-kidnapped-grandfather/embed?style=coverThe accused pair were previously known to police for \"insignificant matters\", Detective Acting Superintendent Andrew Marks said.Police believe more people may have been involved in Baghsarian&#x27;s alleged abduction and murder.Marks said investigators suspect there were \"more than three\" offenders linked to the alleged crime.\"I want to comment on the hard work of the detectives, the analysts, the forensic police, and all those who worked on this case around the clock to get the results we got today,\" Marks said.\"I want to assure you that our work is not done and we will continue to identify those who are also involved in this horrible, horrible matter.\"We know that there&#x27;s others involved.\"Human remains were found in grassland near a golf course in the semi-rural Sydney suburb of Pitt Town on Tuesday morning.The remains were identified as Baghsarian following forensic testing.Police suspect Baghsarian died at an address in Dural, which was identified as the alleged kidnappers&#x27; \"stronghold\".Marks said the grandfather was deceased at the time he was taken to the location in Pitt Town, about 9pm on February 14.His cause of death was yet to be formally established and an autopsy is under way. About 6.30am yesterday, police executed two search warrants in Kenthurst and Castle Hill.Andrews was arrested at the Kenthurst address, and Stevens at the Castle Hill address.Marks said both men were living at their parents&#x27; homes.They were both taken to Riverstone police station, where they were charged with murder and take/detain in company with intent to ransom, occasioning actual bodily harm.They were refused bail to appear in Blacktown Local Court today.Police also conducted a search at a third home in NSW&#x27;s Lake Macquarie and two electronic devices were seized for forensic testing. One of the arrested men travelled to this address following Baghsarian&#x27;s alleged kidnapping, Marks said.He confirmed police have spoken with a person who resides at the property but said they are not a suspect.\" I believe those two that were arrested today, they were probably waiting for us to come,\" Marks said, adding that the parents were \"shocked\" by the arrests.Marks said police believed the men were involved in a \"joint criminal enterprise\" but could not comment on whether overseas actors had organised the incident.He also confirmed the intended kidnapping target would have held for ransom for $50 million.\"They are organised criminals, they hide behind encrypted devices,\" Marks added.\"I have a number of names for them, but I probably couldn&#x27;t say it here today.\"Marks said the incident is \"up there\" among the worst cases he has ever seen. Arrest vision shows police swooping on the home in Kenthurst, before using a battering ram to enter the property and arrest the older man.Officers then arrived at another home in Castle Hill, about 10 kilometres from Kenthurst, and took the second man into custody.Footage also shows the two men being led into Riverstone Police Station. \"We welcome the news of the recent arrests in relation to the kidnapping of our father and grandfather,\" Baghsarian&#x27;s family said in a statement distributed by police.\"As we continue attempting to come to terms with this incident, we ask that media respect our privacy.\"The family said they would not be conducting interviews. Police remained at the properties where the two men were arrested throughout the morning.A car was towed from the Castle Hill address, while police removed bags of evidence from the Kenthurst property.Officers at the latter also gained access to the roof cavity, and conducted line searches through the backyard and the dense bushland at the property&#x27;s rear.&#x27;No stone unturned&#x27;Speaking on 2GB, NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon backed the investigators to the hilt.\"They have left no stone unturned. They have been going been working with the community,\" Lanyon said.\"They have been reviewing both electronic evidence and CCTV. So we&#x27;re very confident, obviously.\"Officers continued to comb the crime scene where Baghsarian&#x27;s suspected remains were found.NSW Premier Chris Minns said the discovery of Baghsarian&#x27;s remains was \"an incredibly tragic development\".Police said a car forensically linked to the 85-year-old was seen a day after his kidnapping near where his suspected remains were found.\"While formal identification is still underway, this is an incredibly tragic development, and our thoughts are with the friends and family of Mr Baghsarian at this heartbreaking time,\" Minns said.\"This kind of brutality has no place in our community. Police will not stop until they capture those responsible and bring them before the courts. The full weight of the law must come down on these people.\"The human remains were discovered near a golf club in Pitt Town in the city&#x27;s north-west during the search for the 85-year-old.WEATHER: State warned to brace for thunderstorms and flash floodingA grey Toyota Corolla forensically linked to an abandoned stronghold in Dural was spotted in Pitt Town about 9pm on February 14, police said.During a raid, officers seized evidence, including disturbing images of the missing grandfather with his alleged kidnappers.Videos of Baghsarian have also been sent to police.The car, which had cloned plates but is believed to have been stolen from Victoria, was found burnt out on Good Street in Westmead on February 16.It had cloned plates of DVT007 , and the Victorian registration 1UZ2BU.Marks said information regarding the investigation led police to the golf course. Baghsarian&#x27;s family were \"deeply upset\" by the discovery and asked for privacy.Police will now focus efforts on identifying the offenders.\" The efforts that have gone in, and the response that has come from the public, we&#x27;re all outraged that this has happened to an innocent man,\" Marks said.\"I am proud of the police and the efforts. Police have been working 24 hours a day since Friday the 13th.\"WEATHER: State warned to brace for thunderstorms and flash floodingThe search for Baghsarian 9News understands the remains were wrapped up in what appeared to be a carpet or towel.Police searched dense bushland near Glenorie, about 15 minutes further east, earlier in the week.Shortly before 9am on Tuesday, a number of police vehicles left that search base to travel to a patch of overgrown grassland near Pitt Town Bottoms Road.Once they arrived at the location, a blue tent - signifying the location of the remains - was raised in minutes. The overgrown piece of land is located in semi-rural surroundings, with businesses including turf farms nearby.Police on the scene included tactical, general duties, and forensics officers as well as investigators.READ MORE: Albanese backs push to remove ex-prince Andrew from line of successionMONEY: Major super shake-up set to impact more than 14 million workersPolice have said the person they believe to have been the intended target of the kidnapping is safe and in no immediate danger.

          "content": "Samsung&#x27;s flagship smartphone for 2026 will launch with an industry-first privacy feature aimed at stopping those prying eyes around you from glimpsing what you&#x27;re looking at on your screen.It&#x27;s called Privacy Display, and while the ability to block angled glances using a third-party screen protector has been around for some years, the ability to firstly do this at a hardware level and secondly do it on an as-needed basis is revolutionary.This feature is achieved by controlling how each pixel disperses light, essentially using fewer pixels and blockage between them to ensure the angled view is restricted. While it&#x27;s not pitch black and a sense of what&#x27;s on screen is possible – and of course, the closer your angle to front-on the more you&#x27;ll see – this feature is a huge leap forward in privacy.READ MORE: Two men charged over alleged kidnap, murder of Sydney grandfatherCritically too, the feature can be enabled on an app-by-app basis and on specific areas of the screen, meaning notifications can be private, and whenever you launch your banking or email apps, they can be locked in privacy mode should you choose.Today&#x27;s launch from Samsung did highlight new artificial intelligence features in the Samsung phones, but the company appears to have pivoted away from being \"all about AI\" and just making AI an everyday feature.Samsung global chief executive TM Roh said, \"We believe AI should be something people can depend on every day, designed to work consistently for everyone and without the need for expertise.READ MORE: Aussies told to leave amid &#x27;deteriorating security&#x27; in Middle East \"With the Galaxy S26 series, we focused on making AI feel effortless, working quietly in the background so people can focus on what matters.\"There will be three S26 phones this year; last year&#x27;s fourth device, the Edge, which was the ultra-thin model, has been dropped, perhaps thanks to a lack of demand in the market. Instead, the company is focussed on its core, the S26, S26+, and S26 Ultra, with the premium Ultra model likely to make up far more than 50 per cent of their sales.It&#x27;s only the S26 Ultra model which features the new privacy screen, while across all three models there are many tweaks and improvements, not least the horizontal lock feature, which allows your video recording to stay stable and level even if the phone is twisted upside down.In a time of rising interest rates and cost of living pressures, both Samsung and their telco partners will be hoping for some forgiveness from buyers with outright prices rising year on year.READ MORE: Ex-union boss arrested again over allegedly threatening emailsThe entry-level S26 is $1549, up from $1399 for the S25. The S26+ is also $150 more than its predecessor while the S26 Ultra is just $50 more than last year&#x27;s model.All three go on sale on March 11, with pre-orders starting today. Samsung will also be hoping their subscription program \"New Galaxy Club\" might appeal to those who upgrade frequently, offering a $14 per month program to get device repair guarantees, and a guaranteed 50 per cent value back when you upgrade a year later.Trevor Long travelled to San Francisco as a guest of Samsung.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
