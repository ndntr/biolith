It is believed they are available only very locally in the Logan community.\"We do not believe there is a widespread risk to the broader community however we encourage people in the Logan area to be alert.\"The investigation remains ongoing, we are continuing to make further enquiries and will keep the community updated.\"If people believe they may have consumed the identified products or are experiencing bleeding that can&#x27;t otherwise be explained, they should visit their local GP, local satellite hospital or urgent care clinic for testing, or call 13 HEALTH for further advice.Brodifacoum is the active ingredient in rat poison that inhibits Vitamin K, which is essential for blood to clot. It can cause bleeding-related complications if ingested by humans.Symptoms include bleeding gums, unexplained bruises, blood in urine or stool and swelling of joints.",
