They&#x27;ve kept themselves just below that threshold,\" he said. \"This bill will lower that threshold, and lower that threshold to the extent that we can within the Constitution. \"We have had enough of organisations that hate Australia, playing games with Australian law.\"READ MORE: Quoting religious texts could be exempted from new hate speech laws Roughly 60 black-clad neo-Nazis from the NSN provoked outrage when they protested outside NSW Parliament House in November with a large sign reading \"abolish the Jewish lobby\".The government released the draft bill to the public today, after yesterday announcing the early recall of parliament to debate it. It includes a package of reforms that target both hate speech and firearms through the establishment of a gun buyback scheme, stricter gun import rules, harsher penalties for hate speech and stricter migration rules.A new offence would be established for a person or group who publicly promotes or incites racial hatred, with a penalty of five years&#x27; imprisonment.Albanese today defended a narrow exception that would ensure the rules did not apply to actions that consist \"only of directly quoting from, or otherwise referencing, a religious text for the purpose of religious teaching or discussion\".READ MORE: Australian teen charged after allegedly making hoax mass shooting calls to the US\"I encourage you to read the Old Testament and see what&#x27;s there and see if you outlaw that, what would occur,\" he told reporters this morning.\"So we need to be careful. We consulted with faith groups, not just with the Jewish community.\"We want to make sure there&#x27;s the broadest possible support for this legislation, but we also want to make sure that there isn&#x27;t unintended consequences of the legislation as well.\"Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive Peter Wertheim claimed the defence is a \"relic of outdated thinking\" and was effectively unnecessary.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
