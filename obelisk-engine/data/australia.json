It cost me my health and my career.\"This has been an incredibly emotionally and financially taxing journey but I never gave up on the truth and on seeking justice.\"Reynolds called on the federal government to review Justice Tottle&#x27;s judgment, saying it should concede claims about a political cover-up of Higgins&#x27; alleged rape involving Reynolds were wrong \"so the real healing can commence\".Justice Tottle found a tweet published by Higgins and her husband David Sharaz in January 2022 was defamatory.It carried imputations Reynolds pressured Higgins not to proceed with a sexual assault complaint and that she was a hypocrite in her advocacy of gender equality and female empowerment.An Instagram story from July 2023, which Higgins later republished on her Threads account, was also found to be defamatory.Reynolds claimed these had imputations she had engaged in a campaign of harassment against Higgins, mishandled Higgins&#x27; rape allegation, and that Reynolds engaged in questionable conduct during Bruce Lehrmann&#x27;s aborted criminal trial for rape.Two of Higgins&#x27; tweets from July 2023, which conveyed the imputation Reynolds wanted to silence sexual assault victims, were also found to be defamatory.But Reynolds&#x27; claim for damages failed because Higgins established the defences of honest opinion, fair comment and qualified privilege, Justice Tottle said.Reynolds&#x27; claim of conspiracy to injure her reputation related to the intent of Higgins&#x27; 2021 interviews with journalists Lisa Wilkinson from Network Ten&#x27;s The Project and Gold Walkley award-winner Samantha Maiden from News Corp also failed.Justice Tottle said Reynolds had not proven Higgins and Sharaz&#x27;s purpose was to injure her.The court upheld Reynolds&#x27; claim Higgins had breached a deed of settlement, which was entered into after the politician was found to have called her ex-staffer a \"lying cow\".Justice Tottle&#x27;s 360-page judgment made factual findings about the events involving Higgins and Reynolds, including the ex-staffer&#x27;s alleged 2019 rape and the events in the years after it.Higgins made 26 false or misleading statements in media interviews after her alleged sexual assault, he saidShe alleged Lehrmann raped her in the senator&#x27;s ministerial suite.A Federal Court judge overseeing a defamation case launched by Lehrmann against Network Ten found Higgins was, on the balance of probabilities, raped by Lehrmann in the office.Lehrmann is appealing that finding.He has always denied the rape allegation and his criminal trial was derailed by juror misconduct.In a separate court action, Reynolds sued Sharaz for defamation over a series of tweets and Instagram and Facebook posts in 2022.Sharaz conceded the case before Reynolds and Higgins went to trial.1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732)National Sexual Abuse and Redress Support Service 1800 211 028",

What happened?Ten police officers attended a rural property on Rayner Track, Porepunkah, just after 10.30am, Victoria Police confirmed in a statement.Police Commissioner Mike Bush said the officers were a combination of local police and members of the Sexual Offences and Child Investigation Team, who were executing a search warrant.\"Two officers were fatally shot and a third was seriously injured after being shot in the lower body,\" a Victoria Police spokesperson said.Bush said the two officers were \"murdered in cold blood\" by a heavily armed gunman.He told the media in an update last night that Freeman was able to escape on foot and was seen fleeing into the bush.Bush said police fired back in Freeman&#x27;s direction after they were attacked, but that he was not believed to be injured. Earlier reports claimed Freeman might have had family members with him but police said his partner and children had attended a police station on Tuesday evening.\"There is nothing to suggest they were ever in the company of the suspect following today&#x27;s incident,\" police said.An urgent call for assistance was made from the property about 10.55am.The wounded police officer was airlifted to The Alfred Hospital in a stable condition, where he has since undergone surgery.No other officers was physically injured.Police from the Special Operations Group and Critical Incident Response Team also remained on scene.\"The suspect for this horrific event is still at large. We believe he is armed,\" Bush said.\"We have deployed every specialist resource into this area to locate him. It is our priority. Our priority is to arrest him to ensure that he&#x27;s held to account for the actions, but also very much to bring safety and security to this community.\"Detectives from the Homicide Squad will investigate the incident and attended the scene along with detectives from the Armed Crime Squad and Fugitive Squad.\"The Police Association Victoria is aware of a critical incident that has unfolded in northeastern Victoria impacting our members,\" a spokesperson said.\"We have sent critical incident support teams to the area to assist and support the impacted members, their families and colleagues.\"A Porepunkah local told 9News she heard two or three gunshots ring out between 9.30am and 10.30am.The woman said she thought the gunfire had come from deer hunters, but thought it was strange for people to be hunting in daylight.What do we know about the accused gunman? The accused gunman on the run has been identified as \"sovereign citizen\" Dezi Freeman.He is a self-described \"sovereign citizen\" who is known to police.According to the Australian Federal Police, a sovereign citizen – also known as a SovCit – seeks to \"disassociate from society and refuses to engage with societal requirements like paying tax\".Police said he had several firearms on him, with Bush confirming police had not recovered any weapons used in the attack.Bush on Wednesday morning did not confirm nor deny reports that claimed Freeman had taken a fallen officer&#x27;s gun as well. He said police had a \"good profile\" of Freeman, but did not go into further detail. Where is Porepunkah?Porepunkah is located on the Great Alpine Road, at the foot of Mount Buffalo, about 300 kilometres north-east of Melbourne.The remoteness of the town means police resources are currently limited. It has a population of 1024, according to the 2021 Census.The nearest town, Bright, is located five kilometres away. Is the situation still active?The accused gunman remains on the run.It&#x27;s believed the offender has left the property and at this time his whereabouts are unknown.A significant search is actively under way to locate the man.Bush said Freeman knew the area better than police and that he \"understands bushcraft well\".It&#x27;s not known if he remained in the area. \"We urge the public in and around the township of Porepunkah to remain indoors until further notice,\" Victoria Police said in a statement.\"We also ask people not to travel into the area.\" Roadblocks have been established in and out of the town, meaning some locals are unable to return home. What is the advice in the local area?The town of Porepunkah has been placed into lockdown as the situation continues to play out. Locals have been asked to stay indoors as the incident unfolds.\"Police are currently at a property in Porepunkah,\" Victoria Police said in a statement.\"This is still an active incident and we will provide more information when it&#x27;s operationally safe to do so.\"We ask people to avoid the area. \"Bush reinforced that declaration on Wednesday morning, urging people to stay on guard and indoors when possible.Porepunkah Primary School was put into lockdown yesterday and remains closed today.READ MORE: Australia Post suspends deliveries to the US after Trump tariffsAlpine Shire Council facilities are also closed, including transfer stations, libraries, visitor information centres and depots across the LGA, the council&#x27;s customer service centre in Bright, and Bright Sports Centre.Local caravan park owner Andrea Siede said police directed guests to take the keys out of all vehicles, lock all doors and stay inside.\"They said, all your workers, put them somewhere safe ...and you need to stay inside your property,\" Siede said.\"No family deserves to be going to work and not returning home.\"One local told 9news.com.au Porepunkah is a \"pretty quiet community\".He said several police cars were seen heading across the town.Alpine Shire Council, the local council servicing Porepunkah, said in a statement it was closing all council facilities \"immediately\".\" This includes all Transfer Stations, Libraries and Visitor Information Centres and Depots across the Shire, Council&#x27;s Customer Service Centre in Bright, and Bright Sports Centre,\" the statement reads.\"Tonight&#x27;s Ordinary Council Meeting has also been postponed, and will be rescheduled for two weeks&#x27; time.\"Further details will be provided at a later date.

The men and women who wear our uniform, wear the uniform of the police take risks each and every day,\" the PM told media in Canberra.\"The Victorian Police Commissioner will be providing updates during the afternoon as more facts that are able to be released become clear.\"Australian Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw joined Albanese and said there were \"grave fears\" for the officers as the incident unfolds.\"Just from the police blue family, the wider family across Australia, and overseas, our thoughts and prayers are with Victoria Police right now,\" Kershaw said.\"And we hope that they are all safe and well, however, we&#x27;re hearing there are some grave concerns for some of those police officers and our hearts go out to the community.\"Victoria&#x27;s Opposition Leader Brad Battin told reporters at parliament that events like this \"impact each and every police officer across Victoria and across Australia\".\"We&#x27;re seeing news, tragic news is happening up in the north of Victoria, and we want to send our thoughts and our strength out to Victoria police members who are hearing some of the news coming through at the moment,\" Battin said.\"We know that when Victoria police members get out of bed every day and go to work, they go to work with risk.\"Each and every day, Victoria police members go out in the face of danger.\"Each and every day they know the risks, and today, we want to send out our thanks to all of them, but more importantly, our thoughts to everyone as events unfold up in the north.\"",
