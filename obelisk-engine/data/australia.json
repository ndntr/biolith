At least 16 people are dead, including one of the alleged killers.Here is what we know so far:On Sunday at 6.47pm local time, police and emergency services were called to Archer Park next to Sydney’s Bondi beach after reports of gunshots.Footage shared on social media showed two gunman firing continuously at a large group who had gathered to celebrate the Jewish festival of Hanukah.At least 16 people are dead, including one of the alleged shooters. Among the dead are Holocaust survivor Alexander Kleytman, London-born rabbi Eli Schlanger, French national Dan Elkayam, businessman Reuven Morrison, retired police officer Peter Meagher and a 10-year-old girl named Matilda. Police believe the oldest victim is 87.Forty-two people were taken to hospital after the attack. As of 8pm Tuesday local time, there were 22 people in Sydney hospitals. Three were in a critical condition, six were in a critical but stable condition and 13 were in a stable condition.Two police officers were among the injured and were both in a serious but stable condition.Police said they were treating the attack as an act of terrorism.The alleged gunmen were a 50-year-old, who was shot by police and died at the scene, and his 24-year-old son, who suffered critical injuries and was taken to hospital under police guard where he remained on Tuesday. The 24-year-old was in a coma but regained consciousness on Tuesday, NSW police confirmed.Media have identified them as Naveed Akram and his father, Sajid Akram.Naveed Akram is an Australian-born citizen, the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, said. His father arrived in 1998 on a student visa, transferred in 2001 to a partner visa and, after trips overseas, had been on resident return visas three times.The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the son first came to the attention of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio) in October 2019. He was examined “on the basis of being associated with others”.New South Wales police and the director general of Asio, Mike Burgess, said one of the shooters was known to authorities, “but not in an immediate threat perspective”.Both Naveed and Sajid Akram travelled to the Philippines in November, but Lanyon said the reason for their travel and what they did when they while there was still under investigation.According to an Agence France-Press report, a Philippines immigration department spokesperson said the pair arrived in the country on 1 November and left on 28 November. Sajid Akram entered the country as an “Indian national”, according to the spokesperson.The NSW police commissioner, Mal Lanyon, said Sajid Akram was a licensed firearms holder with six guns. On Tuesday, Lanyon clarified that Akram applied for a licence in 2015 but it lapsed as he did not get a photo taken. He applied again in 2020 and the licence was issued in 2023.Bomb disposal experts removed two active improvised explosive devices from a car registered to Naveed Akram the scene. Police said on Monday a third IED was located at Bondi.The car registered to Naveed also contained two homemade Islamic State flags, Lanyon said on Tuesday. Continue reading...",

          "standfirst": "Almost 48 hours after the shooting, these are the answers we have.",
          "content": "Two days on from the horrific terror attack targeting the Jewish community on Bondi Beach, questions have been raised about how the despicable shooting was able to occur in Australia, in the middle of one of the country&#x27;s most iconic destinations.Those queries have ranged from how the shooters escaped the watchful eye of security agencies and were able to have so many guns, to the government response to antisemitism.Almost 48 hours after the attack, these are the answers we have to some of those questions.LIVE UPDATES: Accused gunman awake in hospital as police investigate overseas military training trip How did the shooters escape the attention of authorities? Of the father-son pair that carried out the attack, one was known to authorities: 24-year-old Naveed Akram, who had been investigated by ASIO in 2019.Both the Sydney Morning Herald and the ABC have reported he came to the attention of the security agency following the July 2019 arrest of Isaac el Matari, the self-appointed leader of Islamic State in Australia who is currently in jail for planning to carry out a terror attack on Australian soil.However, while Naveed was investigated for six months, he was not considered by authorities to pose a threat.\"He was examined on the basis of being associated with others,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said yesterday.READ MORE: &#x27;Caring&#x27; woman who dedicated life to fighting discrimination named as victim of Bondi attack \"The assessment was made that there was no indication of any ongoing threat or threat of him engaging in violence.\"Naveed is currently in hospital in a critical condition but is expected to be charged over the Bondi attack.The older gunman, 50-year-old Sajid Akram, was killed during the shooting. He had arrived in Australia in 1998 on a student visa, transferred to a partner visa three years later, and was on a resident-return visa at the time of the attack.He was not on authorities&#x27; radar.How did they get access to guns? A member of a gun club, Sajid Akram held an AB licence – which covers single-shot rifles and shotguns, as well as some higher-powered firearms – and legally owned the guns used in the attack. All six of the firearms linked to his licence have now been seized by police.Sajid was first approved for a gun licence in 2015, but that application lapsed because he didn&#x27;t get a photo taken for it.He then applied again in 2020 – after ASIO began investigating his son over ties to IS – and the licence was eventually issued in 2023.NSW Premier Chris Minns said this morning it is \"too early\" to say whether there was an intelligence failure that led to that gun licence being granted.READ MORE: Powerful acts of heroism shaped the Bondi terror tragedy Why wasn&#x27;t there more security at the event? While there was a police presence at the Chanukah by the Sea event targeted by the shooters, authorities have been questioned whether that was adequate, given the rise in antisemitic attacks in Sydney and across Australia since October 7, 2023.Police were on the scene in five minutes and took down the shooters in nine.The police response is being examined in a critical incident investigation, but Commissioner Mal Lanyon has defended the staffing levels at Bondi.\"We base our policing response on the threat that exists at the time,\" he said. \"A lot of work is done between ourselves and the Jewish community. \"Bondi Beach is a large and public area. We regularly patrol that area as we did on that day.\"Both he and Minns have acknowledged that the presence would have been larger had there been intelligence about an attack.\"I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any doubt that if we had our time again, of course we would do things differently,\" the premier said.READ MORE: Bondi attack &#x27;inspired by Islamic State&#x27;, two homemade flags found in car \"I can&#x27;t take back Sunday. Nobody can,\" he added. \"But what we can do is ensure that, in the future, we are putting security in place so that we rebuild trust with the Jewish community.\"Minns did, however, strongly defend the actions of police, saying officers acted with \"bravery and integrity\".\"They engaged the gunman on the footbridge with handguns,\" he said. \"The offenders had long-range rifles, and NSW Police officers were responsible for killing one of them and shooting the other one and, as a result, saving many, many people&#x27;s lives. \"There are two officers in critical care in New South Wales hospitals. They weren&#x27;t shot in the back as they were running away. They were shot in the front. \"I&#x27;m sorry to be graphic about it, but if there&#x27;s any suggestion that NSW Police didn&#x27;t live up to their responsibilities to the people of this state, it should be rejected because it&#x27;s not consistent with the facts.\"READ MORE: Plans for festive events uncertain as Sydney mourns Bondi terror attack Why didn&#x27;t the government act on antisemitic advice given to them months ago? The federal government has been criticised for not doing enough to combat the rise in antisemitism over the last two years, including by special envoy Jillian Segal, Opposition Leader Sussan Ley and former prime minister John Howard.\"(Prime Minister Anthony Albanese&#x27;s) greatest failure is not to provide the moral leadership that a prime minister can in denouncing antisemitism,\" Howard said, while stressing the people responsible for the attack were the two shooters.\"The impression I had was that every time he got onto the subject, he would equate it with discrimination generally.\"In particular, the government has been under fire for not adopting the recommendations to combat antisemitism handed down by Segal in August.READ MORE: After the Bondi attack, Australia&#x27;s terror level remains at &#x27;probable&#x27;. What does that mean? \"The leadership has not been there for Jewish Australians,\" Ley said.The government has defended its actions. While it hasn&#x27;t yet formally adopted Segal&#x27;s recommendations, Albanese pointed to several that it has acted on, including banning the Nazi salute and hate symbols, criminalising doxxing, and millions of dollars in education funding.Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke also pointed to the deportation of people with antisemitic views as action the government has taken.\"We have acted and will continue to act on the implementation of the plan… we&#x27;ll continue to work at the levels with the envoy, including a number of the recommendations for state governments to implement as well,\" Albanese said.The matter has been complicated by the heavy criticism Segal&#x27;s recommendations received, in part for relying on a controversial definition of antisemitism.\"The blueprint falls short in a range of areas essential to good public policy,\" human rights expert Louise Chappell said after their release. \"This is due to its biased arguments, weak evidence and recommendation overreach.\"READ MORE: &#x27;We forever remember your smile&#x27;: Heartbreaking footage of youngest Bondi victim Can we stop this from happening again? Both the federal and NSW governments have promised legal reform in response to the shooting, particularly around stronger gun controls.Investigations into the attack – at least an inquest is likely, and there are already calls for a royal commission – will provide recommendations on how to prevent future incidents.However, it&#x27;s worth noting that ASIO has been warning about the threat posed by lone wolf attacks for years.This was Director-General Mike Burgess at the start of 2024:\"ASIO remains concerned about a lone actor moving from talk to action without warning…\"ASIO remains concerned about lone actors, though – the potential for an individual or small group under the radar of authorities to use readily available weapons to carry out an act of terrorism. READ MORE: Bystanders shown fighting with accused Bondi gunmen in new footage \"And this is a concern across the spectrum of motivations – religious and ideological.\"And this was Burgess early this year:\"The most likely perpetrator of a terrorist attack is a lone actor, from a family previously unconnected to extremism…\"All (terror matters investigated last year) were lone actors or small groups. \"Almost all the individuals were unknown to ASIO or the police and it is fair to say they allegedly moved towards violence more quickly than we have seen before.\"It&#x27;s also crucial to note that ASIO is effective at detecting and stopping terror attacks.But the reality is they cannot monitor every person in the country.\"They do a marvellous job: ASIO, the AFP, their state ministry counterparts,\" former home affairs secretary Mike Pezzullo said yesterday, who added that \"not every cell is intercepted\" by authorities.\"They can&#x27;t be everywhere. And frankly, if they were, we&#x27;d be a police state.\"If you have been impacted by the terror attack in Bondi there is support available.To contact Lifeline Australia, call 13 11 14 or text 0477 13 11 14.For people under 25 years old, you can contact Kids Helpline at 1800 55 1800.Both of these are available on a 24/7 basis.If you wish to donate blood, you can find your nearest donor centre here.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Under the national terrorism advisory system, probable is defined as \"a terrorist attack is probable and the government has concerns of a plausible threat\".When the alert level was raised, Australians were told there \"is a greater than 50 per cent chance of an onshore attack or attack planning in the next 12 months\".However, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said a \"probable\" alert does not mean \"inevitable\".Why was the terrorism threat level changed?At the time, intelligence experts said the decision to raise the threat level was not triggered by any single ideology or issue, but an overall rise in polarisation in Australia and other Western nations.The terror threat level was last changed in 2022, when it was lowered to \"possible\".\"The advice that we have received is that more Australians are embracing a more diverse range of extreme ideologies and it is our responsibility to be vigilant,\" Albanese said in August last year.READ MORE: Bondi hero would &#x27;do it again&#x27; despite being &#x27;riddled with bullets&#x27;\"To be clear, this is the same threat level that was in place in Australia for more than eight years before it was lowered in November of 2022.\"At that time, we said as a government, it&#x27;s does not mean the threat from terrorism is extinguished.\"The national terrorism threat level is a warning tool to provide the government and the public an indication of what ASIO is seeing and anticipates in the near future.Will the terrorism threat level change? In the hours after the attack, Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) Director-General Mike Burgess maintained the threat level would likely not change from \"probable\".\"I don&#x27;t see that changing at this stage,\" he said.\"One incident by itself does not necessarily raise the threat level at the national level, but we keep that under constant review.Burgess confirmed investigations are ongoing into any other possible threats, after father and son Sajid and Naveed Akram were named as the shooters.\"We&#x27;re looking to see if there&#x27;s anyone in the community that has similar intent,\" he said. \"It&#x27;s important to stress at this point, we have no indications to that fact, but that is something we have active investigations on.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "President Donald Trump mocked Rob Reiner in a social media post on Monday, suggesting the slain actor and director died because of his anti-Trump views — a remark that triggered swift and bipartisan backlash for injecting politics into a family tragedy.A vocal Democratic activist, Reiner, 78, and his wife Michele, 70, were found dead in their home on Sunday. Their son Nick Reiner was arrested on homicide charges. Police have yet to ascribe a motive.In a post on Truth Social, Trump referred to Rob Reiner as \"tortured and struggling\" and said Reiner and his wife had passed away \"reportedly due to the anger he caused\" by opposing the Republican president.READ MORE: Rob Reiner&#x27;s son Nick arrested after director and his wife found dead \"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump,\" the president said.The White House reposted Trump&#x27;s comments on its official \"Rapid Response\" account on X.The president, who frequently lashes out at his opponents and praises public figures who support him, offered no evidence that Reiner&#x27;s political views contributed in any way to the couple&#x27;s death.Trump&#x27;s comments on Monday drew criticism from across the political spectrum.\"Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered,\" wrote Republican U.S. Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky.\"This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,\" wrote Republican U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.Both Massie and Greene are Trump critics, a rarity within the president&#x27;s party.But even House Speaker Mike Johnson, a major Trump ally, distanced himself from the president&#x27;s post. \"We have to appeal to our better angels, and I think we&#x27;ve got to amplify those voices and those sentiments. So that&#x27;s my position on it,\" he told reporters when asked about Trump&#x27;s comments.Asked in the Oval Office if he stood by the post after the Republican criticism, Trump replied that he was not a Reiner fan.Reiner told Variety in 2017 during Trump&#x27;s first term that Trump was \"mentally unfit\" and called him \"the single most unqualified human being to ever assume the presidency of the United States.\"Trump said in his post on Monday that Reiner had the \"mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME,\" a term the president uses for many of his critics.The Democratic Party called Trump&#x27;s post \"heartless.\"David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, called it perverse. \"The absence of empathy & grace for the Reiner family in their moment of profound loss and grief is sad and revealing,\" he wrote on X.Republicans and Trump supporters were sharply critical of anyone who highlighted right-leaning activist Charlie Kirk&#x27;s controversial views in the aftermath of his murder in September.Reiner was long one of the most prolific directors in Hollywood, and his work included some of the most memorable movies of the 1980s and &#x27;90s, including This is Spinal Tap, A Few Good Men, When Harry Met Sally, and The Princess Bride.His role as Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic in Norman Lear&#x27;s 1970s TV classic All in the Family, as a liberal foil to O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Archie Bunker, catapulted him to fame and won him two Emmy Awards.The son of comedy legend Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner was married to photographer Michele Singer Reiner since 1989.The two met while he was directing When Harry Met Sally and had three children together: Nick, Jake and Romy.READ MORE: Bondi hero would &#x27;do it again&#x27; despite being &#x27;riddled with bullets&#x27;DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "A 10-year-old girl, a Holocaust survivor, a former police officer and a great-grandfather are among the 15 people who were killed in the father-and-son terrorist attack at Bondi Beach. Dozens more were injured when Sajid and Naveed Akram allegedly fired dozens of shots targeting Jewish people celebrating the first day of Hanukkah on Sunday evening.Twenty-four people remain in several hospitals around Sydney in conditions ranging from stable to critical as of 4.30pm today, according to NSW Health.LIVE UPDATES: Australia mourns as Bondi victims fight for life; Philippines trip by alleged shooters probedTwo were police officers, a constable who exchanged fire with the gunman and a probationary constable.Ahmed El-Ahmed, the hero bystander who helped disarm one of the gunmen, is among the injured recovering at St George Hospital.Those who died are yet to be formally identified, however police believe their ages range between 10 and 87 years.Here is what we know about the victims so far. Matilda — 10-year-old girlThe youngest victim has been identified as 10-year-old Matilda.She smiled for a photo after having her face painted, petted some farm animals and had been enjoying the celebrations with her six-year-old sister on Sunday evening.But when the gunmen opened fire, she was fatally shot in front of her sister. She was rushed to hospital, but could not be saved. Her aunt, Lina Chernykh, shared footage of Matilda taken hours before she was killed.She said the heartbroken family will never recover from their loss.\"A happy kid,\" she told 9News.\"She was open-hearted. Everywhere she goes, she was like a sun.\"Matilda has been remembered as a \"bright, joyful, and spirited child who brought light to everyone around her\", according to her language teacher Irina Goodhew, who has launched a fundraising appeal for her family.\"Yesterday, while celebrating Hanukkah, her young life was tragically taken. Her memory will live on in our hearts,\" she wrote on the fundraising site. Boris and Sofia Gurman - husband and wife Boris, 69, and Sofia Gurman, 61, were a Russian-Jewish couple living in Bondi who were the first victims of the shooting.They were walking when they came across Sajid Akram firing early shots.Dashcam footage showed Boris disarm him, grabbing the gun like a cricket bat and charging at him while his wife watched on.But Akram had more than one weapon. He fired and fatally shot the husband and wife.Their family said their actions proved the type of people they were.\"While nothing can lessen the pain of losing Boris and Sofia, we feel an overwhelming sense of pride in their bravery and selflessness. This encapsulates who Boris and Sofia were – people who instinctively and selflessly tried to help others,\" they said in a statement.His family said the couple were going to celebrate Sofia&#x27;s birthday tomorrow and their 35th wedding anniversay in January.\"Boris was a retired mechanic, known for his generosity, quiet strength and willingness to lend a hand to anyone in need. Sofia worked at Australia Post and was deeply loved by her colleagues and community,\" their family said.The pair were remembered for living \"honest, hardworking lives\" and treating everyone with \"kindness, warmth and respect\".Witnesses described Boris as a \"hero\". \"He was a hero. He tried, he tried. We need to let his family know,\" a witness told 9News.\"Everyone needs to know what he tried, because it was right in the beginning. And he put himself in that face of danger. There were bullets flying already, and he put his self in the face of danger.\"Edith Brutman — community service workerEdith Brutman was a devoted member of the Jewish community who was killed while attending Sunday&#x27;s event.She was the vice president of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith NSW, the state&#x27;s branch of the international Jewish community service organisation.President of the Alfred Dreyfus Unit at B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith, Ernie Friedlander, told The Sydney Morning Herald she was a \"good, caring human being\".\"She was a very clever lady, and she was very, very passionate about dealing with prejudice and discrimination. She was always there, and she had very strong opinions,\" he said.Alex Kleytman — Holocaust survivorAlex Kleytman was an 87-year-old Holocaust survivor who died in the Bondi attack, according to Chabad, a US-based global Hasidic Jewish organisation that hosted the Hanukkah event at Bondi.He is the oldest known victim of the shooting. He had survived the genocide with his mother and younger brother in Siberia before he and his wife, Larisa Kleytman, migrated to Australia from Ukraine.They had been married for nearly 60 years.Larisa, also a Holocaust survivor, confirmed his death to The Australian.\"He came on Bondi Beach to celebrate Hanukkah, for us it was always a very, very good celebration, for many, many years,\" she said.Peter Meagher — former police officerPeter Meagher, a former police officer and Randwick Rugby volunteer and manager, was working as a freelance photographer at the Hanukkah event when he was shot, his club said.Randwick Rugby said he served for almost 40 years with NSW Police and retired as a detective sergeant. \"The tragic irony is that he spent so long in the dangerous front line as a police officer and was struck down in retirement while taking photos in his passion role is really hard to comprehend,\" the club said.Meagher had also worked as a long-time referee before spending much of the last decade as a first-grade manager and volunteer for Randwick Rugby.His club said news of his death has hit the players, coaches, managers, volunteers and supporters \"extremely hard\". \"&#x27;Marzo&#x27;, as he was universally known, was a much-loved figure and absolute legend in our club, with decades of voluntary involvement, he was one of the heart and soul figures of Randwick Rugby,\" the club said.\"Rest in Peace &#x27;Marzo&#x27; - we all love you and will miss you greatly. We are devastated.\"Reuven Morrison — heroReuven Morrison, a 62-year-old immigrant from the Soviet Union, was killed while trying to protect the community from the gunmen.He was captured on footage throwing bricks at Sajid after he was disarmed by local hero Ahmed Al Ahmed.His daughter, Sheina Gutnick, said it was only fitting that her father died while trying to save lives.\"From my sources and understanding, he had jumped up the second the shooting started. He managed to throw bricks at the terrorist,\" she told CBS News.\"He was screaming at the terrorist, and protecting his community, he was shot dead.\"If there was one way for him to go on this earth, it would be fighting a terrorist. There was no other way he would be taken from us. He went down fighting, protecting the people he loved most.\" Gutnick said her father migrated to Australia believing he would be safe. Eli Schlanger — rabbiEli Schlanger was a rabbi, father of five and chaplain for Corrective Services NSW.The 41-year-old, who welcomed his newborn baby just six weeks ago, helped organise the Hanukkah event when he was shot dead.His brother-in-law, rabbi Mendel Kastel, said their \"family is broken\", while his cousin, Zalman Lewis, remembered him as a \"truly an incredible guy\".Rabbi Menachem Dadon, whose daughter was shot but survived, said he had held Schlanger as he died.Alex Ryvchin, of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said Schlanger was the \"best of us\".\"This was a man who got up every morning with the purpose of doing good. That&#x27;s all he did,\" he said.\"He drove around, and he gave things to charity, and he fed the needy. And he visited prisoners in prisons. And he just lived to do good things.\"Corrective Services NSW Commissioner Gary McCahon said Schlanger was a \"valued member\" and was \"devoted to supporting others with compassion and dignity\".\"His loss will be felt by many. I extend my deepest condolences to his family, friends, colleagues, and the broader Jewish community during this immensely painful time,\" he said.Yaakov Levitan — rabbiYaakov Levitan was a rabbi, a father and an active member of the Jewish community who lost his life celebrating the first day of Hanukkah.He served as general manager of Chabad of Bondi, secretary of the Sydney Beth Din centre and a key figure in educational initiatives at the BINA Centre. He has been remembered as a \"profoundly beloved and active member of the Sydney Jewish community\" and the \"cornerstone of his family\".\"He was a man of quiet devotion, known for his kindness and tireless work in assisting others, including his commitment to distributing tefillin as a sacred act of service,\" according to a fundraising page set up to raise money for his family \"His senseless murder has left an irreplaceable void.\"Marika Pogany — lifelong volunteerMarika Pogany was sitting in the front row of the Hanukkah event when she was fatally shot.The 82-year-old was a decade-long volunteer for Meals on Wheels and Coa Sydney, an organisation providing community services to elderly Jewish people.She won an award for service to her community after she delivered more than 12,000 kosher meals.COA Sydney said she was the \"beating heart\" of the organisation and a \"source of warmth for thousands of people\". \"She lifted the room simply by being in it,\" the organisation said in a statement.\"She asked for nothing and gave everything. She showed us what true service looks like and she did it without fanfare and without ever wanting attention.\"We are shattered by her loss. Marika gave real love to this community and her impact runs deep.\"May all those that knew Marika and had the blessing to be touched by her, be comforted and consoled by the memories of a truly remarkable and wonderful woman.\" Her friends told 9News of decades of friendship, saying she was an \"amazing person\" and they were \"very fond of her\".Tibor Weitzen — great-grandfatherTibor Weitzen was a 78-year-old great-grandfather who had reportedly gone to the event to celebrate the first day of Hanukkah with his wife and grandchildren.He died shielding a family friend who also lost her life. His granddaughter told 9News her family is \"shattered\" by his death.\"Just devastating. Honestly, I&#x27;ve got no words,\" she said.\"And we were just yesterday with him. We had coffee at Bondi Junction with him yesterday. I didn&#x27;t know this was going to be, you know, the last day.\"Dan Elkayam — French engineerDan Elkayam was a 27-year-old engineer from France who had moved to Australia.French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to him after he was killed at Bondi and offered his thoughts to his family.\"It is with deep sadness that I learned of the death of our compatriot Dan Elkayam in the anti-Semitic terrorist attack in Sydney,\" he said in a statement on X.\"My thoughts are with his family and loved ones, and I express to them the full solidarity of the nation.\"French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the country was mourning with Elkayam, and described the shooting as \"despicable\".His partner, Krystal, is \"navigating profound grief while suddenly having to face life on her own\", according to a fundraising site set up by her friends.The fundraising site has raised almost $28,000 for her.The top donation was from the south Sydney football club Elkayam played for, Rockdale Ilinden Football Club, of $2500.Elkayam was a member and player for the team&#x27;s premier league one team.The club said it was in \" extreme shock and sadness\" over the \"horrendous, tragic and senseless events\".\"Dan was an integral member of our PL1 Squad in 2025, who was an extremely talented and popular figure amongst teammates,\" the club said.\"Our deepest and sincerest condolences to Dan&#x27;s family, friends and all that knew him.
