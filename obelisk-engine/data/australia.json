          "content": "An accused synagogue arsonist has been released on bail after a magistrate found 22 strict conditions could reduce his risk to the community.Giovanni Laulu, 21, watched via video link from Barwon Prison as magistrate Leon Fluxman handed down his decision in Melbourne on Friday afternoon.It&#x27;s alleged Laulu and two others used 100 litres of fuel to set fire to the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne&#x27;s south-east about 4.15am on December 6, 2024.READ MORE: Four people accused of killing Australian brothers on Mexican surf trip due to face courtThe trio allegedly drove to the Ripponlea site in a stolen Volkswagen then smashed their way in using an axe before setting the place of worship alight.The blaze, which caused more than $20 million in damage, was being investigated as a terrorist attack, the court was told.Prosecutor Diana Karamicov argued Laulu should be refused bail because he was an unacceptable risk of endangering the community and committing further offences.She pointed to his previous failures to comply with bail and court orders, and noted his \"terrible\" criminal history which included violent assaults, affrays and armed robberies.Karamicov argued the Crown&#x27;s case against Laulu was strong and if convicted of the arson charge, he was facing up to 15 years behind bars.Laulu&#x27;s barrister, Dermot Dann KC, argued the strength of the case was not relevant as Laulu did not need to prove exceptional or compelling reasons to be released.READ MORE: ACT schools closed over asbestos found in decorative coloured sandDann told the court Laulu had repeatedly denied the offending and, given his age, the presumption of innocence and his isolation in custody, he should be released.The barrister argued strict bail conditions including a curfew and location exclusion zones could alleviate any of the court&#x27;s concerns.Laulu&#x27;s mother was also putting forward a $20,000 surety for her son and was willing to have him back home with her if he was released, Dann noted.In handing down his decision, Fluxman accepted Laulu was a risk to the community but found strict bail conditions could reduce that risk to an acceptable level.Fluxman accepted his decision was \"line-ball\" and would receive consternation from the Jewish congregation, who were still traumatised from the fire.But he noted Laulu was a young man who was presumed to be innocent and it was important to promote his rehabilitation while also curtailing his liberty.The magistrate also emphasised Laulu had not been charged with terror offences, and there was no evidence he was an anti-Semite or had affiliations with terrorist groups.Laulu will be subjected to 22 bail conditions, including a 9pm to 6am curfew and a ban on entering Ripponlea or other synagogues.He will have to return to Melbourne Magistrates Court later in November for a bail review hearing.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
