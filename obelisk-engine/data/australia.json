Clocks strike midnight in Auckland, a population of 1.7 million, 18 hours before the famous ball drops in New York&#x27;s Times Square.Auckland&#x27;s five-minute display involved 3500 fireworks launched from various floors of the 240-metre Sky Tower. Smaller community events were cancelled across New Zealand&#x27;s North Island due to forecasts of rain and possible thunderstorms.READ MORE: Sydney Harbour&#x27;s powerful Bondi tribute amidst NYE celebrationsSubdued events after devastating yearIn Indonesia, cities scaled back New Year&#x27;s Eve festivities as a gesture of solidarity with communities devastated by catastrophic floods and landslides that struck parts of Sumatra island a month ago, claiming more than 1100 lives.The capital, Jakarta, will not ring in 2026 with its usual fanfare, choosing instead subdued celebrations with a calm and reflective program centred on prayers for victims, city Governor Pramono Anung said last week.Makassar Mayor Munafri Arifuddin urged residents of one of Indonesia&#x27;s largest cities to forgo parties altogether, calling for prayer and reflection instead. \"Empathy and restraint are more meaningful than fireworks and crowds,\" he said.Concerts and fireworks on Indonesia&#x27;s tourist island of Bali have been cancelled and replaced with a cultural arts event featuring 65 groups performing traditional dances.Hong Kong was ringing in 2026 without the usual spectacle over iconic Victoria Harbour after a massive fire in November killed at least 161 people. The facades of landmarks were turning into countdown clocks presenting a light show at midnight.Temple bells rang across Japan, and some people climbed mountains to see the year&#x27;s first sunrise. Others were eating noodles in a traditional wish for long life because of the noodle&#x27;s shape. In South Korea&#x27;s capital, Seoul, a bell tolling was held at the Bosingak Pavilion.Palestinians in Gaza said they hope the new year brings a definitive end to the war between Israel and Hamas that has battered the enclave for two years, as negotiators push for progress into the ceasefire&#x27;s challenging second phase.\"We hope that it will be a good year for our people in Palestine,\" said Faraj Rasheed, noting that thousands continue to live in harsh conditions in tent camps.Others described 2025 as a year of loss. \"The war humiliated us,\" said Mirvat Abed Al-Aal, displaced from the southern city of Rafah.Berliners celebrate in snowfall, additional security in NYCTourists and Berliners marked the end of 2025 by taking selfies and making snowmen in front of the German capital&#x27;s cathedral and the iconic Brandenburg Gate. The Berlin TV Tower was nearly invisible thanks to the falling flakes and fog.Greece and Cyprus were turning down the volume, replacing traditional fireworks with low-noise pyrotechnics, light shows and drone displays in capital cities. Officials said the change is intended to make celebrations more welcoming for children and pets, particularly animals sensitive to loud noise.Police in New York City will have additional anti-terrorism measures at the Times Square ball drop, with \"mobile screening teams\". It is not in response to a specific threat, according to NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch.After the ball drops it will rise again, sparkling in red, white and blue, to mark the country&#x27;s upcoming 250th birthday.Zohran Mamdani will take office as mayor at the start of 2026. Two swearing-in ceremonies are planned, starting with a private ceremonial event about midnight in an old subway station.",
