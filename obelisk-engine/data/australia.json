          "standfirst": "The Australian Human Rights Commission has called for it to be treated with the same urgency and seriousness as Bondi.",
          "content": "Police are investigating the alleged hurling of a homemade bomb into a crowd of Invasion Day protesters in Perth as a \"potential terrorist act\".The declaration tonight came amid growing calls for the incident on Monday to be treated as terrorism.\"The Western Australia Joint Counter Terrorism Team (WA JCTT) can confirm it is investigating the incident at Forrest Place in Perth on Australia Day as a potential terrorist act,\" the WA Police Force, Australian Federal Police and Australian Security Intelligence Organisation said in a joint statement.A 31-year-old man has been charged but his identity can&#x27;t be revealed because of concerns for his safety.CCTV footage released yesterday afternoon appears to show a man dressed in black launching the device from a balcony outside Myer and taking off as it lands in a crowd of 2500.It did not detonate and no injuries were reported. Organisers of the Invasion Day protest at Forrest Place in the CBD had begun to accuse police and the government of downplaying the alleged motive.\"Any other group, a white group, the police would have come out and said this is a hate crime, this is an act of terrorism and they would have handled things appropriately and these things would have been handled a lot different,\" rally organiser Fabian Yarran said today.Before the declaration was made, Emergency Services Minister Paul Papalia said changing the label wouldn&#x27;t change the police response.\"Declaring something a terrorist incident requires confirmation of the motivation behind the individual and I&#x27;m not sure that they understand the motivations behind this individual at the moment,\" he said.After the September 11 attacks in the US, national terrorism laws were introduced in Australia carrying a maximum sentence of life in prison. They allow people to be charged with a raft of offences including engaging in an act of terrorism and planning an attack. The 31-year-old man was charged with making or possessing explosives under suspicious circumstances and one count of an unlawful act or omission with intent to harm. He was not charged with any terror-related offences but investigators today said their investigation was continuing and didn&#x27;t rule out further charges.Greens MP Sophie McNeill, who was at the rally, said the alleged attack was \"clearly designed to terrorise\".\"Yet so far the alleged attacker has not been charged with such offences,\" she said.University of Western Australia Associate Professor Tamara Tulich said a terrorist act was defined in the criminal code as having three elements: purpose, motive and harm.Human Rights Commission wants incident treated like Bondi The Australian Human Rights Commission tonight urged national action on racism in response to the incident.Social Justice Commissioner Katie Kiss called for the \"potential mass casualty event\" to be treated with the same urgency and seriousness as the Bondi Beach terrorist attack in December.\"Invasion Day gatherings are spaces for truth‑telling, cultural strength and calls for justice - not fear,\" Kiss said in a statement tonight.\"While the motive is yet to be determined, there is no question that the targets of the attack were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their allies.\"Had the device detonated the results could have been catastrophic, and potentially as deadly as the Bondi terrorist attack.\"Race Discrimination Commissioner Giridharan Sivaraman said hate and discrimination must be addressed urgently and comprehensively.\"The Australian Human Rights Commission&#x27;s National Anti-Racism Framework, which the federal government has yet to endorse and implement, provides a blueprint for effective action for tackling racism,\" he said. \"We cannot afford to wait any longer. Precious lives and freedoms are at imminent risk.\"NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

          "content": "Nationals leader David Littleproud will face a spill next week, less than a fortnight after pulling his party from the federal Coalition.MP Colin Boyce announced this morning that he will challenge Littleproud for the leadership of their party, describing the decision to split the Coalition for the second time in a year as \"political suicide\".\"I will be moving a spill motion on Monday afternoon in the Nationals partyroom to give my colleagues an option,\" he told Sky News.READ MORE: New inflation data deals hammer blow to millions of Aussies \"Because the reality is, if they follow the course they&#x27;re on now, they are going over a political cliff...\"I will be standing for the leadership.\"While Sussan Ley&#x27;s position as Liberal leader is considered tenuous following the Coalition split, with conservative rivals Andrew Hastie and Angus Taylor both eyeing off her position, Littleproud&#x27;s judgement has also been drawn into question.He and the rest of the Nationals&#x27; shadow ministry resigned en masse from the front bench last week after Ley accepted the resignation of three of the party&#x27;s senators for voting against shadow cabinet solidarity.READ MORE: Australian dollar cracks 70 US cents on climb to three-year high The following day, while Ley didn&#x27;t hold any media appearances due to the national day of mourning for the Bondi terror attack, Littleproud denied cabinet solidarity had been breached, labelled the Coalition \"untenable\", and said the Nationals would sit on their own in parliament.Littleproud faced a challenge at the start of this term, when he defeated Senator Matt Canavan in a leadership ballot following last year&#x27;s federal election.There is no guarantee Boyce&#x27;s spill will amount to a full-blown challenge, as a majority of the party room needs to support the motion before candidates can nominate for the leadership.Canavan has all but ruled out a repeat challenge this time, telling the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age Boyce&#x27;s spill was news to him.READ MORE: Pauline Hanson leaps ahead of Sussan Ley as preferred prime minister \"I see no reason to change our team now,\" he said.However, Boyce, who has been in federal parliament since 2022, said the Nationals needed to change direction, and remain in the Coalition to challenge the increasing threat from One Nation.\"David has made some bad decisions recently,\" he said.\"He&#x27;s upset just about everybody you could possibly upset…\"(Re-establishing the Coalition) is the most viable way forward for the National Party, for the Liberal Party and for wider conservative politics.\"In a statement, Littleproud said he respected Boyce&#x27;s right to voice his opinion, but defended his leadership. \"I stand by my record as leader of the Nationals and what our partyroom has achieved, through important policy work and standing up for regional, rural and remote Australia,\" he said.The Nationals held all of its House of Representatives seats at the last election.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

The 26-year-old got up to fight off the group, who were wearing masks and hoods and wielding a knife.READ MORE: Couple held at gunpoint during violent home invasionShaw refused to hand over his keys and valuables as the group hurled themselves, as well as furniture and cans, at him. He said he was struck in the arm with a machete, hit over the head with a tree branch and punched during the confrontation. \"Pretty brutal, when I was the only one there to defend myself. It was six against one,\" he told 9News.\"I was fearing for my life a little bit.\" White, who was hiding in another room, said one of the home invaders took out their phone and started recording Shaw being punched in the face. She managed to secretly call triple zero before her phone was ripped away from her.The attack was over in just five minutes, and the group allegedly fled on Shaw&#x27;s motorbike with his Xbox and wallet. \"They said if I contact the police or anything they&#x27;ll come back and kill me,\" Shaw said. READ MORE: Australia has a new most valuable companyBut police were nearby and able to intercept the group.\"By the time they got up the road, the police were coming down the road and saw them all trying to get on the bike,\" White said. The group allegedly dumped the bike and managed to scatter in every direction, but not before police arrested a 26-year-old man from Elizabeth North.He has been charged with several serious offences.His alleged accomplices are still on the run as the victims try to recover from the attack.\"They might get a thrill out of it, but it&#x27;s just not worth it. Someone might get seriously injured or killed,\" Shaw said. \"It&#x27;s horrible, no one should ever go through something like this,\" White said.
