          "content": "The judge who found Bruce Lehrmann likely raped his then-colleague Brittany Higgins was \"distracted\" by allegations of a parliamentary cover-up, a court has been told.The former federal political staffer was found by Justice Michael Lee to have, on the balance of probabilities, raped Higgins in parliament house in 2019.The judge&#x27;s decision was revealed in April 2024 after Lehrmann sued Network Ten and journalist Lisa Wilkinson for defamation over an interview with Higgins during which she aired the allegations.READ MORE: Man charged with murder over &#x27;random&#x27; alleged stabbing attack on 83-year-old man Lehrmann has launched an appeal against the ruling in the Federal Court, arguing he was denied procedural fairness and should be awarded more than $20,000 in damages.Wilkinson&#x27;s lawyer on Thursday urged the panel of judges to find her client had acted reasonably in broadcasting Higgins&#x27; rape claims on The Project in 2021.Justice Lee found the journalist and Ten had acted unreasonably in publishing the allegations, in part because they should have seen the entwined allegations of a cover-up as implausible.Higgins claimed she had reported the rape to her superiors at parliament house, including her boss then-senator Linda Reynolds, but little action was taken.But Sue Chrysanthou SC argued the alleged cover-up should have been considered separately from Higgins&#x27; account of sexual assault, because it was not connected to Lehrmann.\"His Honour was distracted by the so-called cover-up when he should have focused on the rape,\" she said.Justice Lee found the journalist wanted to tell the \"explosive political story\" of \"an extraordinary cover-up\" and did not do any further checking or research.But Wilkinson had been shown \"compelling\" evidence of Higgins&#x27; report of sexual assault and her contact with a rape crisis centre in Canberra, her lawyer said.\"By the time of broadcast, there was no doubt in my client&#x27;s mind of contemporaneous reports of rape,\" Chrysanthou said.She contended Justice Lee failed to consider dozens of emails sent to various political figures who were given the opportunity to respond to Higgins&#x27; claims.READ MORE: Teen charged with murder over alleged underworld shootingAny denials received were included in the broadcast, Chrysanthou said, as part of the \"exemplary conduct\" of her client and Ten.\"Over and over again, (Justice Lee) criticises the belief in the allegations,\" she told the court.\"They didn&#x27;t just blindly believe them, they asked people: &#x27;Is this right?&#x27;\"The court was told Lehrmann, who has not been convicted of any offence related to Higgins&#x27; allegations, was also emailed for his response on the Friday afternoon prior to the broadcast, but he claimed he only received the query afterwards.Justice Lee was critical that the former Liberal staffer had not been provided enough time to respond to the claims, but it was not Wilkinson&#x27;s job to contact him, her lawyer said.The broadcast veteran had been so \"convinced he might respond\" that she spent the night preparing interview questions, Chrysanthou told the court.Wilkinson was an experienced journalist who discharged her responsibilities well but was excluded from some relevant emails and discussions of the final broadcast, the court was told.Lehrmann has argued that, given the seriousness of the rape claims, Wilkinson should have personally made her own inquiries and properly notified him about Higgins&#x27; allegation.Chrysanthou encouraged the court to uphold Justice Lee&#x27;s finding that the rape claims broadcast on The Project were substantially true.Lehrmann is arguing the judgment should be overturned on four grounds, including that Justice Lee used a definition of rape that was inconsistent with what an ordinary person would understand.He maintains he did not sexually assault Higgins and a criminal case in 2022 was abandoned without any findings against him.Readers seeking support can contact 1800 RESPECT on 1800 737 732.National Sexual Abuse and Redress Support Service 1800 211 028",

          "standfirst": "Mark Butler proposed that children with \"mild to moderate\" autism or developmental delays would be removed from the NDIS and diverted to a new program known as Thriving Kids.",
          "content": "M illions of Australian parents are now scrambling to find out how the move to scale back young people with autism on the NDIS could impact their children.Federal Health Minister Mark Butler yesterday proposed that children with \"mild to moderate\" autism or developmental delays would be removed from the NDIS and diverted to a new program known as Thriving Kids by July 2027.T he exact government definition of \"mild to moderate\" autism and learning difficulties remains unclear.READ MORE: Your personal data could be on the dark web waiting for the highest bidderThe NDIS graded children under seven on the autism spectrum as between level 1 and level 4 in a 2021 consultation report.The changes are a little under two years away and the federal government is still hashing out the details.Butler described the NDIS as \"not the right fit\" for many children with an autism diagnosis. He said impacted children won&#x27;t be taken of the NDIS right away and assured parents it won&#x27;t be an immediate transition. \"I get that parents are feeling unsure after the announcement I made and I want to reassure them that we&#x27;re not going to leave them high and dry,\" Butler told Today.\"I&#x27;m going to make sure that that everyone who is on the NDIS now remains on it, but over the next couple of years we will introduce a new scheme for thriving kids that will support those those kids coming those ages and their parents way that, frankly, they should be.\"How the government will distinguish mild to moderate against severe autism will be a \"clinical\" issue, Butler said.It was confirmed children with autism who will still need the NDIS will be considered on a case-by-case basis. \"There&#x27;s no there&#x27;s no debate that there will be some people for whom autism is permanent, and of course, they will be on the NDIS as they should be,\" Butler said.READ MORE: NATO warplanes scrambled amid Russian drone attacks on UkraineGreens Senator Jordan Steele-John accused the federal government of using children with autism as a \"political football\" and said people living with autism don&#x27;t \"grow out\" of it.\"Autism is lifelong. There is no growing out of it,\" he said.\"The minister&#x27;s suggestion otherwise denies reality and risks stripping people of the supports they need to thrive.\"Founder of Macquarie Health Collective Tanya Forster said the NDIS change could see more children \"fall through the cracks\".\"This announcement has created unnecessary uncertainty and anxiety for families across the country,\" Forster said.\"I appreciate that the NDIS system is incredibly costly but the focus should be on stamping out fraudulent behaviour, not removing vulnerable children from a program because the government needs to reduce spending.\"We regularly see these children struggle with fine or gross motor skills, sensory difficulties, language or social communication concerns, as well as difficulties with anxiety and emotion regulation – these children need access to the services provided under the NDIS.\"Butler yesterday claimed one out of every 10 six-year-olds are on the NDIS in Australia.Forster said the federal government should examine why there are soaring cases of developmental vulnerability among kindergartners as a priority.READ MORE: Rain, storms to come down hard on NSW todayShadow Health and Aged Care Minister Anne Ruston said the NDIS changes should be guided by clinical advice. Ruston said the Coalition was concerned about Australians in regional and rural areas who already struggle to access NDIS services.\" We remain committed to working in good faith with people living with disability, scheme participants, their families, and support and health providers to ensure the NDIS is sustainable and true to its purpose into the future,\" a Coalition spokesperson said.How does the NDIS support children with autism?Children aged under seven living with autism receive $16,700 per year on average, as per the data in 2019 according to the NDIS. The average NDIS participant with autism receives $32,800 in annualised NDIS funding. Individual NDIS funding for people with autism varies and is modelled against support needs and progress goals.\"Claims of the NDIA clawing back support outlays for developmental/autism conditions, particularly in children, are not correct,\" the NDIS said in a statement on its website in 2019.What is Thriving Kids? Butler said children with \"mild to moderate\" autism would be diverted to a new scheme called Thriving Kids by July 2027. The initial investment for Thriving Kids will be $2 billion dollars.The transition will take place once Thriving Kids is fully operational.Thriving Kids has been described as \" tailored supports for children with mild to moderate developmental delays and autism designed to support families to access the right help at the right time\".DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
