          "content": "The Coalition is in freefall after the fallout from a revolt in the Senate saw the entire Nationals&#x27; frontbench, including leader David Littleproud, quit. The move was triggered by division over the federal government&#x27;s new hate speech laws, which forced three Nationals senators who refused to join the Liberals in voting for the reforms to hand in their resignations.Opposition Leader Sussan Ley confirmed in a statement today she had accepted the resignations of senators Susan McDonald, Bridget McKenzie and Ross Cadell.

The new hate speech and gun laws were passed last night after a long night of voting in the Senate.The hate laws will create powers for authorities to designate certain organisations as \"hate groups\", allowing members and donors alike to face possible jail time.It will create new aggravated offences for religious or spiritual leaders who advocate violence, as well as penalise religious leaders who preach hate to children.The new framework will also give ministers more powers to cancel or refuse visas to those who spread hate or extremist views.The new gun laws, which were voted against by the Coalition, One Nation and United Australia Party senators but supported by the Greens, will limit the imports of guns to Australian citizens.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
