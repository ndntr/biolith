Authorities also issued an emergency warning for increased rainfall and possible flash flooding for the Rubyvale and Sapphire areas.Premier David Crisafulli told Today he was proud of how the state had responded to the ex-cyclone, but insisted the danger was far from over.\"Our message remains that there is that risk of heavy rainfall, and that&#x27;s always been what we&#x27;ve consistently said,\" he said.\"There are the real risk of having those really heavy rains, which could lead to flooding because those catchments are very full.\"READ MORE: Impeachments info removed from Smithsonian&#x27;s Trump portraitThere have been no fatalities from the weekend&#x27;s storms, but more than 40,000 livestock and cattle are estimated to have perished due to the weather.A large rescue took place at Greenacre, near Rockhampton, where a woman, her two children and two dogs were caught in their car.

More than 22,000 properties were without power on Sunday night, but Ergon had restored power to 90 per cent of those homes and businesses. \"That is now down to 2500,\" Crisafulli said.Crisafulli praised the efforts of communities, councils and emergency services and the federal government for helping limit the impact of the severe weather.\"That doesn&#x27;t happen by magic. That happens because people work through the night and resources are on the ground,\" he said.READ MORE: Man charged after man dies at Sydney immigration centre The premier urged Queenslanders to remain vigilant over the next couple of days: \"Queenslanders know how to handle heavy rain, we are a very disaster-resilient state, we&#x27;ll just continue to put out that messaging that there is that risk in the next 24-48 hours of some really significant rainfall in patches.\"If people do the right thing and make their preparations, we will get through this unscathed.\"Crisafulli also confirmed he would chair the state disaster meeting in Proserpine in the Whitsundays region, insisting people in the western parts of the state being smashed by the wild weather \"will not be forgotten\".
