Palmer has announced that he will be challenging the international tribunal&#x27;s decision in Switzerland&#x27;s Federal Supreme Court. He said this was the \" next step in the journey to achieve justice in the matter, hopeful of the final arbiter taking an opposite view to that of the tribunal\".DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
