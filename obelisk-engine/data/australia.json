Today, passengers were ferried to the mainland before travelling home to Australia, via a chartered flight to Cairns.Australian and PNG authorities had been working to re-float the cruise ship but efforts had been unsuccessful until earlier today.It&#x27;s no longer grounded with experts managing to move it off the reef today. It&#x27;s now anchored nearby and undergoing further inspections.The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is investigating and will conduct interviews and collect evidence.READ MORE: New warnings for life-threatening flash floods as Queensland smashed by rain\"In the meantime, data from the ship&#x27;s voyage data recorder has been quarantined, and investigators are collecting other relevant recorded information, including ship tracking data, weather information, and crew, operator and maintenance records,\" the bureau said in a statement. The 12-night cruise, costing $13,280 per person, departed from Cairns on December 18 and reached Papua New Guinea on December 20.It was cruising up the coastline before it ran aground on Saturday.Coral Adventurer has faced troubled waters after the death of 80-year-old NSW tourist Suzanne Rees in October.The cruise ship left her behind during a luxury trip to the remote Lizard Island , where she was later found dead by police.Investigations into that event are ongoing.
