No, of course it is not,\" he said.\"But it is the next thing we must do…\"The awful truth is this work will never end because there will always be bad people who try to poke holes in the system and find vulnerabilities.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Erik Menendez has been denied parole after serving decades in prison for murdering his parents with his older brother in 1989.A panel of California commissioners denied Menendez parole for three years, after which he will be eligible again, in a case that continues to fascinate the public. A parole hearing for his brother Lyle Menendez, who is being held at the same prison in San Diego, is scheduled for Friday morning local time.The two commissioners determined that Menendez should not be freed after an all-day hearing during which they questioned him about why he committed the crime and violated prison rules.READ MORE: Millions facing days of flood risk as torrential rain easesThe brothers became eligible for parole after a judge reduced their sentences in May from life without parole to 50 years to life.The parole hearings marked the closest they&#x27;ve been to winning freedom from prison since their convictions almost 30 years ago for murdering their parents.The brothers were sentenced to life in prison in 1996 for fatally shooting their father, Jose Menendez, and mother, Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989. While defence attorneys argued that the brothers acted out of self-defence after years of sexual abuse by their father, prosecutors said the brothers sought a multimillion-dollar inheritance.READ MORE: CCTV shows violent attack on one of NSW&#x27;s most notorious prisonersA judge reduced their sentences in May, and they became immediately eligible for parole.Erik Menendez made his case to two parole commissioners, offering his most detailed account in years of how he was raised, why he made the choices he did, and how he transformed in prison. He noted the hearing fell almost exactly 36 years after he killed his parents – on August 20, 1989.\"Today is August 21st. Today is the day that all of my victims learned my parents were dead. So today is the anniversary of their trauma journey,\" he said, referring to his family members.The state corrections department chose a single reporter to watch the videoconference and share details with the rest of the press.Erik Menendez&#x27;s prison recordMenendez, grey-haired and spectacled, sat in front of a computer screen wearing a blue T-shirt over a white long-sleeve shirt in a photo shared by officials.The panel of commissioners scrutinised every rules violation and fight on his lengthy prison record, including allegations that he worked with a prison gang, bought drugs, used cellphones and helped with a tax scam.He told commissioners that since he had no hope of ever getting out then, he prioritised protecting himself over following the rules. Then last fall, LA prosecutors asked a judge to resentence him and his brother – opening the door to parole.READ MORE: Great for Melbourne, bad for Sydney: The factors causing August&#x27;s strange weather\"In November of 2024, now the consequences mattered,\" Menendez said. \"Now the consequences meant I was destroying my life.\"A particular sticking point for the commissioners was his use of cellphones.\"What I got in terms of the phone and my connection with the outside world was far greater than the consequences of me getting caught with the phone,\" Menendez said.The board also brought up his earliest encounters with the law, when he committed two burglaries in high school.\"I was not raised with a moral foundation,\" he said. \"I was raised to lie, to cheat, to steal in the sense, an abstract way.\"The panel asked about details like why he used a fake ID to purchase the guns he and Lyle Menendez used to kill their parents, who acted first and why they killed their mother if their father was the main abuser.Commissioner Robert Barton asked: \"You do see that there were other choices at that point?\"\"When I look back at the person I was then and what I believed about the world and my parents, running away was inconceivable,\" Menendez said. \"Running away meant death.\"His transformation behind barsErik Menendez&#x27;s parole attorney, Heidi Rummel, emphasised 2013 as the turning point for her client.\"He found his faith. He became accountable to his higher power. He found sobriety and made a promise to his mother on her birthday,\" Rummel said. \"Has he been perfect since 2013? No. But he has been remarkable.\"Commissioner Rachel Stern also applauded him for starting a group to take care of older and disabled inmates.Since the brothers reunited, they have been \"serious accountability partners\" for each other. At the same time, he said he&#x27;s become better at setting boundaries with Lyle Menendez, and they tend to do different programming.More than a dozen of their relatives, who have advocated for the brothers&#x27; release for months, delivered emotional statements at Thursday&#x27;s hearing via videoconference.\"Seeing my crimes through my family&#x27;s eyes has been a huge part of my evolution and my growth,\" Menendez said. \"Just seeing the pain and the suffering. Understanding the magnitude of what I&#x27;ve done, the generational impact.\"His aunt Teresita Menendez-Baralt, who is Jose Menendez&#x27;s sister, said she has fully forgiven him. She noted that she is dying from stage four cancer and wishes to welcome him into her home.\"Erik carries himself with kindness, integrity and strength that comes from patience and grace,\" she said.One relative promised to the parole board that she would house him in Colorado, where he can spend time with his family and enjoying nature.The board brushed off prosecutor&#x27;s questionsLA County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said ahead of the parole hearings that he opposes parole for the brothers because of their lack of insight, comparing them to Sirhan Sirhan, who assassinated presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy in 1968. Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom denied him parole in January 2022 because of his \"deficient insight.\"During the hearing, LA prosecutor Habib Balian asked Menendez about his and his brothers&#x27; attempts to ask witnesses to lie in court on their behalf, and if the brothers staged the killings as a mafia hit. Commissioners largely dismissed the questions, saying they were not retrying the case.In closing statements, Balian questioned whether Menendez was \"truly reformed\" or saying what commissioners wanted to hear.\"When one continues to diminish their responsibility for a crime and continues to make the same false excuses that they&#x27;ve made for 30-plus years, one is still that same dangerous person that they were when they shotgunned their parents,\" Balian said.What happens nextLyle Menendez is set to appear over video conference Friday for his parole hearing from the same prison in San Diego.The case has captured the attention of true crime enthusiasts for decades and spawned documentaries, television specials and dramatizations. The Netflix drama Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story and a documentary released in 2024 have been credited for bringing new attention to the brothers.Greater recognition of the brothers as victims of sexual abuse has also helped mobilize support for their release. Some supporters have flown to Los Angeles to hold rallies and attend court hearings.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
