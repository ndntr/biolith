          "content": "There are fears homes may have been lost in an erratic and fast-moving bushfire burning out-of-control on the Fleurieu Peninsula of South Australia.Strong and volatile winds are pushing the flames further into the Deep Creek National Park, and authorities warn conditions are expected to worsen tomorrow.The unpredictable bushfire is tearing through a rugged landscape, with more than 250 firefighters working to contain a blaze that&#x27;s already burned through nearly 2000 hectares and is threatening communities including Cape Jervis and Silverton.READ MORE: Former Liberal senator Cory Bernardi joins One NationThe skies above Deep Creek were a crimson red, prompting some residents to start packing their bags.\"You could see red across the hill, so Deep Creek was burning. I knew it was at Silverton,\" one resident told 9News.By late yesterday, those who remained were told it was too late to leave.\"We slept in our cars last night at Cape Jervis then went back to check our houses were there, which they were, and then had to vacate again,\" Darren Rigg told 9News.Fire crews worked through the night to defend homes, businesses and livestock and their efforts persisted throughout today.The Country Fire Service is yet to confirm if any homes have been lost but 9News understands a business has been impacted. \"This fire is not going away,\" CFS Chief Officer Brett Loughlin said. \"It&#x27;s going to continue to be a challenge for us.\"The local community has been rallying, with holiday park owner Ben Taylor offering up his own backyard for all those needing shelter.\"For as long as needs be, until they get it all under control and people can safely go back to their homes and stuff like that they&#x27;re all welcome, that&#x27;s fine,\" Taylor told 9News.The impact and intensity of the blaze has been far reaching, with Kangaroo Island ferry services halted last night.They resumed this afternoon but only for essential freight and emergency services.Main South Road is still closed westbound between Delamere and Cape Jervis, with limited access for those travelling east.\"Whilst there is still active fire coming up onto the roadside and we have strike teams of firefighters diligently working there, it is not a safe environment and that road is going to remain closed for an extended period of time,\" Loughlin said.While the threat has reduced for now, authorities say fire crews have an enormous task ahead of them with the first still burning out-of-control.There is an extreme fire danger warning and a total fire ban in place for tomorrow with winds set to increase across the Mount Lofty Ranges, which includes the fire ground on the Fleurieu Peninsula.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
