Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the shooting as a \"targeted\" and \"evil\" act of antisemitism.LIVE UPDATES: Gunmen were father and son; Sixteen people dead, more injured in Bondi Beach shootingIt occurred three years after the deadly Wieambilla ambush, and almost 11 years to the day since the Sydney Lindt café siege.The Bondi attack is now the deadliest mass shooting in Australia in the 21st century, but it is not the only tragedy the nation has witnessed in the past 25 years.Here is a timeline of some of the worst shootings in Australia since uniform gun laws were introduced after the Port Arthur massacre in 1996.Bondi Beach shooting: December 14, 2025Two gunmen opened fire on Bondi Beach just before 7pm (AEDT) on Sunday, which was also the first day of Hanukkah.A Jewish event was being held on the beach when shots first rang out.Beachgoers and bystanders scattered, some seeking shelter behind cars or taking refuge inside local businesses.Dozens of people were shot and at least 16 people died, including one of the gunmen.Improvised explosive devices were also found at the scene after the attack.The shooting was declared a terror attack by NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon within hours , and Albanese called it an \"act of evil, antisemitism, terrorism\". 9News confirmed the alleged shooters were Sajid Akram, 50, and his son Naveed Akram, 24.Sajid died at the scene and Naveed remains critically injured in hospital under police guard. READ MORE: What we know about the two Bondi Beach gunmenWieambilla shooting: December 12, 2022Police arrived at a rural property in Wieambilla, Queensland on the afternoon of December 12 to conduct a welfare check and follow up a warrant.When the residents, brothers Gareth and Nathaniel Train, and Gareth&#x27;s wife, Stacey Train, did not emerge four police officers entered the property.They were ambushed and shot at with rifles.Constables Rachel McCrow, 29, and Matthew Arnold, 26, were killed. The Trains shot another officer in the hip and lit a grass fire in an attempt to locate the fourth officer, who had hidden.Alan Dare, a neighbour, was shot trying to flee the fire.Additional police arrived to the scene and an hours-long standoff ensued. It ended with the deaths of Gareth, Nathaniel and Stacey Train.An inquest in November 2025 found that the Trains were \"psychotically unwell\" with a \"shared delusional disorder\", but not terrorists.READ MORE: Grief-stricken families disappointed by Wieambilla coronial findings Darwin mass shooting: June 4, 2019Benjamin Glenn Hoffmann was high on drugs when he began shooting at the Palms Motel in Darwin in the early evening of June 4, 2019.He fired multiple shots inside the motel, calling out for someone named \"Alex\".Police were called to the scene but Hoffmann fled in a vehicle.He travelled to Gardens Hill Crescent residential apartments, where he fired more shots before moving to the Buff Club, a pub just metres away.Hoffman continued to the Darwin Recycling Centre and NT Police Headquarters, before travelling in a ute back towards the city centre.Police finally arrested him on a main road into the city, about an hour after the first shots were fired.Four people were killed and a fifth was injured. Hoffman was sentenced to three life sentences for the murders of Hassan Baydoun, 33, Michael Sisois, 57, and Rob Courtney, 52, and 15 years for the manslaughter of 75-year-old Nigel Hellings.READ MORE: Darwin mass shooter sentenced to life in prison without parole Margaret River shooting: May 11, 2018The shooting at Osmington, Western Australia, in 2018 was the worst shooting incident in Australia since the Port Arthur massacre until the Bondi Beach attack.An early morning Triple-Zero call brought police to a family farm where they discovered seven dead, including four children.Katrina Miles, 35, and her four children – Taye, 13, Rylan, 12, Arye, 10, and Kayden, eight - were found dead in their beds. Katrina&#x27;s mother Cynda Miles, 58, was found dead in the main house and her father Peter Miles was found dead on the verandah.Rifles were uncovered at the property and police quickly ruled the deaths a murder-suicide.Police held Peter Miles responsible for the deaths of his wife, daughter, and grandchildren.READ MORE: The family killed in the Margaret River mass murder-suicide Sydney siege terrorist attack: December 15, 2014On the morning of December 15, 2014, self-styled Muslim cleric Man Haron Monis walked into the Lindt Cafe on Martin Place.An hour later, the store was locked down with more than a dozen hostages inside as Monis brandished a gun.Café manager Tori Johnson was ordered to call Triple Zero and tell police the cafe was under attack.Monis claimed bombs had been planted in Martin Place, Circular Quay and George Street. These claims were later proven false. Police and tactical operations units arrived at the scene believing it to be a possible terror attack.An hours-long standoff ensued and in the early hours of the morning of December 16, Monis shot Johnson dead. Police subsequently forced entry to the café and confronted Monis, who was shot dead by police.One of the hostages, Katrina Dawson, was also struck by bullet fragments and died.READ MORE: Officer who shot Lindt Cafe terrorist says he was haunted by harrowing dayPort Arthur massacre: April 28, 1996In 1996, Martin Bryant killed 35 people and injured 23 others in what remains to this day the deadliest mass shooting in Australian history.The attack started with the murder of two people at Seascape, a bed and breakfast in the Tasmanian tourist town of Port Arthur. He then travelled to the Port Arthur Historic Site, where he opened fire at the Broad Arrow Café.Bryant murdered dozens of people in the cafe, gift shop and car park before fleeing the scene.He killed more people as he left the historic site and at a service station nearby, where he also abducted a man. That man was later killed.Eventually Bryant returned to Seascape Guesthouse, where an 18-hour standoff with police ensued.He was captured by police on April 29 and subsequently sentenced to 35 sentences of life imprisonment for each of the murders.He was also sentenced to 25 years for 20 attempted murders, among other charges.READ MORE: Heartbreaking letters from dad who lost family in Port Arthur massacre revealedIf you have been impacted by the terror attack in Bondi there is support available.To contact Lifeline Australia, call 13 11 14 or text 0477 13 11 14.

READ MORE: What we know about the Bondi gunmen \"It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner,\" the family said.\"We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time.\"The Los Angeles Fire Department said it responded to a medical aid request shortly after 3.30pm (10.30am AEDT) and found a 78-year-old man and 68-year-old woman dead inside.Reiner turned 78 in March.Detectives with the Robbery Homicide Division were investigating an \"apparent homicide\" at Reiner&#x27;s home, Captain Mike Bland with the Los Angeles Police Department said.Los Angeles authorities have not confirmed the identities of the people found dead at the residence in the upmarket Brentwood neighbourhood on the city&#x27;s west side that&#x27;s home to many celebrities.Reiner was long one of the most prolific directors in Hollywood, and his work included some of the most memorable movies of the 1980s and &#x27;90s, including This is Spinal Tap, A Few Good Men, When Harry Met Sally and The Princess Bride.His role as Meathead in Norman Lear&#x27;s 1970s TV classic All in the Family, alongside Carol O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Archie Bunker, catapulted him to fame and won him two Emmy Awards.Relatives of Lear, the legendary producer who died in 2023, said they were bereft by the news.\"Norman often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary, to us and the world,\" said a Lear family statement.\"Norman would have wanted to remind us that Rob and Michele spent every breath trying to make this country a better place, and they pursued that through their art, their activism, their philanthropy, and their love for family and friends.\"Messages to Reiner&#x27;s representatives were not immediately returned on Sunday night.Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called Reiner&#x27;s death a devastating loss for the city.\"Rob Reiner&#x27;s contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,\" Bass said in a statement.\"An acclaimed actor, director, producer, writer, and engaged political activist, he always used his gifts in service of others.\"The son of comedy legend Carl Reiner, Rob Reiner was married to photographer Michele Singer Reiner since 1989.The two met while he was directing When Harry Met Sally and have three children together.Reiner was previously married to actor-director Penny Marshall from 1971 to 1981.He adopted her daughter, Tracy Reiner.Carl Reiner died in 2020 at age 98 and Marshall died in 2018.Killings are rare in the Brentwood neighbourhood.The scene is about several kilometres from the home where O.J. Simpson&#x27;s wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman were killed in 1994.- Reported with Associated Press",
