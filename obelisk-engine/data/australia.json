To appeal her sentence or convictions, Patterson&#x27;s defence team need to provide specific grounds for the appeal, such as errors of law, an unreasonable verdict, or a miscarriage of justice.READ MORE: Latham&#x27;s ex faces court over revenge porn allegationsREAD MORE: Father with no criminal links to be charged over Sydney shootingIf the appeal grounds are valid, Patterson&#x27;s case would be heard by judges in the Court of Appeal.These judges have the ability to overturn sentences or convictions if they find grounds to.If an appeal against a sentence is allowed, the Court of Appeal could reduce or increase the sentence.If the Court of Appeal decides there was no legal error, the appeal will be dismissed and the original sentence will stand.A breakdown of Patterson&#x27;s prison sentence Patterson was last month sentenced to life in prison with a non-parole period of 33 years, meaning she will remain behind bars for at least that long.Assuming it is not successfully appealed, Patterson&#x27;s sentence, which includes the 676 days she served in pre-sentence detention, would see her eligible for release on parole in 2056 at the age of 81.Beale sentenced Patterson to four separate sentences, all to be served concurrently:For the attempted murder of Ian Wilkinson, Patterson was sentenced to 25 years in prison.For the murder of Heather Wilkinson, she was sentenced to life in prison.For the murder of Don Patterson, life in prison.For the murder of Gail Patterson, life in prison.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

It is in this construct that we&#x27;re going about in signing this treaty.\"READ MORE: Miss this looming deadline and face up to $1650 in fines But at the same time, it secures Australia&#x27;s defence position in its closest neighbour, and Albanese said that, under the treaty, \"both of the nations have also agreed not to undertake any activities or enter into any agreements that would compromise the implementation\".\"Today, we have a cracker of a result,\" the prime minister added.The full text of the treaty will be publicly released by the government and must still be ratified by both nations&#x27; parliaments.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Acting Superintendent Stephen Parry alleged Mintzas was firing shots \"indiscriminately\" at passing cars from the window of his unit above a business, injuring more than a dozen people and hitting several cars.READ MORE: Masked attackers set UK mosque on fire with people insideThere are a number of restaurants, small businesses, a church, and a vet nearby. Mintzas allegedly exchanged fire with specialist and tactical police before they narrowed in, arresting him about 9.30pm and seizing a gun. \"Our tactical operations group are highly trained, very skilled at what they do, and they executed the plan extremely well,\" Parry told reporters this afternoon. Mintzas was also taken to hospital with minor injuries after glass smashed and shattered around his eye, and has since been released. He is currently at Burwood Police Station and is expected to be charged with firearm offences later this afternoon.READ MORE: Dog euthanised after allegedly being attacked by group outside shopping centre Croydon Park remains an active crime scene today as police scour the site looking for more evidence.\"We have found a number of items at the scene which will lead us to a number of lines in inquiry,\" Parry said.

His employment status is now under review pending the outcome of the investigation.Parry said Mintzas is a father with very little history with police. He said he does not have a firearms license and does not have any links to terror, organised crime or mental health issues.\"He&#x27;s a 60-year-old male who does have a couple of children and has very few recorded interactions with the police over the last 20 years,\" he said.Mintzas &#x27; family has been notified. Detectives are currently questioning Mintzas to determine his motives and how he allegedly obtained the gun.Parry said he is speaking \"freely\" with officers. \"My 35 years in the police, there&#x27;s been very few instances of this nature where somebody is randomly targeting people in the street driving past in vehicles,\" he said.READ MORE: Thieves swipe Pokémon cards worth over $20,000 from vending machine At least 16 people injured A total of 13 cars, including two police vehicles, and a nearby bus shelter were shot at with bullets shattering through the glass.At least 16 people suffered minor injuries.Three people were taken to hospital, including a man who was shot in the neck while he was in the backseat of a car with his family.His family drove him to hospital, and he has since undergone surgery. \"My understanding is that the injuries are not life-threatening and he is expected to survive thankfully,\" Parry said.Two other people who were hospitalised have since been released.No police officers were injured.Parry said that it was \"incredible\" that no one was killed and, if not for the response by police, the situation could have been \"a whole lot worse\".
