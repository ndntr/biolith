          "content": "The eyes of the world will be on Australia today after we became the first nation to roll out age restrictions for social media.From midnight, all Australians under 16 years of age have lost access to social media - so now what?Long story short, those youngsters are no longer able to hold accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Snapchat, TikTok, Reddit, X, YouTube, Twitch and Kick.Communications Minister Anika Wells expects children around the country to try to evade the restrictions.READ MORE: Noah learnt about the social media ban on social media. Now, he&#x27;s fighting it in courtThe eSafety Commission will monitor which platforms children may move to and issue any penalties for non-compliance.Here is a breakdown of everything you need to know now that the ban is in effect. What are the penalties for children under 16?The federal government acknowledges that the ban will not be \"100 per cent effective\" in preventing children under 16 from accessing restricted social media platforms and that they will find their ways around it.\"Some of that is going to happen, but that&#x27;s what teenagers do,\" eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said.The onus, however, lies on social media platforms and not children who bypass the rules. There is no penalty for children under 16 who access restricted social media platforms, or their parents or guardians.The eSafety Commission said the ban is about \" protecting young people, not punishing or isolating them\".READ MORE: Are video games impacted by Australia&#x27;s world-first social media ban?What are the penalties for social media platforms?Platforms face hefty penalties if they do not take \"reasonable steps\" to prevent children under 16 from having accounts. The eSafety Commission defines reasonable steps as:Enforcing the age restriction in a just and appropriate way, including finding and removing existing accountsPreventing new accounts and workaroundsHaving processes to correct errors if someone is mistakenly missed or included in the restrictionIf a platform fails to do so, a court can order civil penalties, including fines of up to $49.5 million.How are these penalties enforced? The eSafety Commission will monitor and enforce any penalties for non-compliance in accordance with the law.It may also pursue court action. Inman Grant said she will start gathering information and issuing compliance notices now that her powers have kicked in.

Under-16s will see their social media accounts either be deactivated or deleted, depending on the platform.Facebook, Instagram, Threads, TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, and X indicated they are deactivating accounts until the user is 16. Snapchat said it will remove accounts.All remaining platforms have not specified how exactly the ban will be enforced Australians over 16 will not be affected. Anyone making a new account after today may have to verify their age through facial verification or a government-issued ID.However, platforms must offer options so that users are not forced to share their ID if they do not wish to.
