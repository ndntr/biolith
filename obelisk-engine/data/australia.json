          "content": "The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) officially declared a tropical low lurking in the Coral Sea a cyclone on Saturday evening.Tropical Cyclone Koji has strengthened to a Category 2 storm and is forecast to cross the Queensland coast, near Ayr, north of Bowen, in the coming hours.Koji, which has gusts of up to 130km/h is currently 190 kilometres northeast of Townsville and 205 kilometres east-southeast of Innisfail. LIVE UPDATES: Water in bushfire-ravaged town &#x27;not safe to drink&#x27;, authorities warnThe slow-moving system could still pick up more strength while out at sea, as it tracks south towards the Queensland coast at a speed of 11km/h. The BoM&#x27;s warning zone currently extends across South of Lucinda to Mackay, including Townsville, Palm Island, Bowen, Proserpine and Whitsunday Islands. There are multiple \"take shelter now\" emergency alerts in place, all the way from Townsville to Airlie Beach.Locals are being told if they have any concerns, to get themselves to evacuation shelters and facilities to keep themselves and their families safe. Koji&#x27;s effects have already been felt along Queensland&#x27;s coastline with choppy surf and palm trees resembling rag dolls, as they flop back and forth in the wind.The bureau warns of gales with damaging wind gusts of up to 100km/h between Cardwell and Airlie Beach overnight, which may extend south to areas between Proserpine and Mackay during the morning.Townsville Airport has already closed until the system passes over and dozens of flights into and out of Hamilton Island have been cancelled. A severe weather warning is currently in place for heavy to locally intense rainfall and damaging winds about the northeast and central Queensland coasts.Heavy rainfall which could lead to flash flooding is forecast to develop from Ingham to Proserpine tonight.Locally intense rainfall, which the BoM says \"may lead to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooring\", is possible between Townsville and Proserpine overnight, extending south to Mackay on Sunday. Complicating management of the weather event is a serious connectivity issue affecting the Townsville area.READ MORE: NSW set to face extreme fire dangersA thief cut a telecommunications line while trying to steal copper in Deeragun.\"My message to that lowlife is you have put at risk the lives of North Queenslanders in their hour of need and you can&#x27;t get a lower act than that,\" Premier David Crisafulli said.\"And we intend to make sure that we throw the book at this individual when they are caught.\"Telecommunications are life and death.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
