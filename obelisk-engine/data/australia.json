He allegedly placed bets under this name with Sportsbet, Ladbrokes and Neds in September 2021, while \"being in possession of information in connection with the event contingency about conduct that corrupts or would corrupt a betting outcome of the event\".

He allegedly also placed bets across a range of wagering services – including Palmerbet, Betstar, Bookmaker, TAB, bet365, Betfair, TopSport, Ladbrokes and Neds – under his own name.Pell&#x27;s brother Donovan, 31, has been charged with 23 offences, including using two different account names and dishonestly obtaining their personal credentials, to place bets about who would poll Brownlow Medal votes at the 2021 awards.Mitch Lucas, 32, has been accused of 20 offences including communicating information about the 2022 Brownlows to others, knowing they would place bets, and placing bets himself under both his own name and a different name. The documents were released to media today, after all four men faced court in person.READ MORE: Pro-Trump personality Charlie Kirk dead after shooting on US college campusThe charges related to about $300,000 in fraudulent betting, the court was told, and many of the co-accused and witnesses in the case are family members or co-workers.Magistrate Brett Sonnet said the accused men, who were charged on summons, each needed to be placed on bail as the charges were \"serious\".He placed them all on bail with conditions that they reside at their homes and cannot leave Australia.The group will return to court on October 22 for committal mentions.Umpires award Brownlow votes on a 3-2-1 basis after each game, with tight security around the details until the AFL chief executive reads them out on presentation night.Umpires and other AFL personnel are not allowed to gamble on the game.Port Adelaide&#x27;s Ollie Wines won the 2021 award, with Carlton captain Patrick Cripps claiming the Brownlow the next year.The AFL ruled out changes to the voting process after the scandal but Victoria&#x27;s gambling watchdog unveiled greater safeguards in 2023, including spot audits on AFL employees and greater surveillance of umpires.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Violence has gripped the US political scene once again after prominent conservative commentator Charlie Kirk was shot dead.The 31-year-old, who was a key ally of President Donald Trump was killed while speaking at a university in Utah.Trump paid tribute to Kirk, calling him a \"martyr for truth and freedom\" and blaming \"the radical left\" for the shooting.AS IT HAPPENED: Gunman fired from &#x27;a long distance&#x27;But it was just the latest in a growing number of shootings and violent incidents against US politicians on both sides of the political divide.As the country comes to terms with Kirk&#x27;s death, it also faces the reality that gun violence is becoming an increasingly regular part of its politics.July 13, 2024: Attempted assassination of Donald Trump in Pennsylvania The most recent wave of political violence began during last year&#x27;s election campaign, when the then-Republican candidate for the presidency was shot by a sniper at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.In a massive security failure, Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, managed to fire eight rounds from a rifle from a nearby building as Trump spoke.One member in the crowd was killed, as was Crooks moments later by a Secret Service agent, but it was the first attempt on the life of a president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1981.Crooks was once a registered Republican but had donated sums of money to progressive movements and causes before the shooting.Trump was injured in the shooting with a bullet grazing his ear, though he claimed he could have died had his head been in another position.He rose quickly to his feet after being covered by security and Secret Service, and a photo of the wounded Trump raising his fist to the crowd has become one of the most iconic photos ever.READ MORE: Who was Charlie Kirk? Conservative figure who helped build support for Trump among young people shot deadSeptember 15, 2024: Second attempt on Trump&#x27;s lifeJust two months later, Trump was the target of another assassination attempt, this time at his own golf club in Florida.Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old man, had hidden in bushes on Trump International Golf Course and was armed with a rifle.He was spotted aiming the gun at a member of Trump&#x27;s security detail, and it is believed he was planning to shoot the Republican candidate.A Secret Service agent shot at Routh, who tried to flee but was eventually arrested after a chase.April 13, 2025: Arson attack on Pennsylvania governor&#x27;s homeJosh Shapiro, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, was the target of an alleged assassination attempt when part of his residence was set on fire.Cody Allan Balmer broke into the residence in Harrisburg and reportedly used two Molotov cocktails to trigger the blaze.The 38-year-old was also allegedly armed with a sledgehammer to confront Shapiro with if he encountered the governor, but he wasn&#x27;t able to do so and later turned himself in to police.Balmer was previously diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which he rejected, and reportedly targeted Shapiro due to \"perceived injustices toward the people of Palestine\".READ MORE: How Charlie Kirk changed conservative media - and US politicsJune 14, 2025: Shooting of Minnesota legislatorsThe next attack saw two Minnesota Democratic state legislators attacked by a lone gunman.Vance Luther Boelter first broke into the house of Senator John Hoffman, shooting him and his wife Yvette, hospitalising the pair.He then travelled to the home of Melissa Hortman, shooting and killing her and her husband Mark.Boelter then fled and sparked a massive manhunt, with police eventually capturing him the next evening.A reported motive for Boelter&#x27;s attacks was his strong anti-abortion views.September 10, 2025: Assassination of Charlie KirkThe assassination of Charlie Kirk is the latest chapter in a concerning trend in US politics.The conservative commentator was speaking at Utah Valley College this morning when he was shot in the neck.The gunman is still at large at the time of writing, but it is believed the shots were fired from a building up to 200 metres from where Kirk was speaking.Kirk leaves behind a wife and two young children, and figures across America&#x27;s political spectrum condemned the shooting.\"Michelle and I will be praying for Charlie&#x27;s family tonight, especially his wife Erika and their two young children,\" former president Barack Obama said on X.The previous president Joe Biden also posted a statement against the shooting: \"There is no place in our country for this kind of violence. It must end now.

I will learn from it. I&#x27;m sure others will too,\" Price said yesterday.\"No individual is bigger than a party. And I&#x27;m sure events of the past week will ultimately make our party stronger.\"Ley has maintained that Price remains \"warmly welcomed\" in the Liberal Party. A new shadow minister for the defence industry and defence personnel is expected to be announced in the near future. READ MORE: Home insurance premiums just spiked by $700 in one regionLast week during an interview with the ABC, Price accused the federal government of allowing more migrants in from \"particular countries over others\" to skew votes and singled out the Indian community.She later walked back her statement and said: \"Australia maintains a longstanding and bipartisan non-discriminatory migration policy. Suggestions otherwise are a mistake\".Her remark came days after anti-immigration rallies, some of which targeted Indian Australians, were held across the country on August 31.Price has continued to ignore calls from several of her colleagues, as well as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, to say sorry.She failed to do so as recently as her press conference yesterday, where she acknowledged the remarks were \"clumsy\" but said she \"would love to be able to move forward from this\". Ley has previously tried to minimise damage by touring Little India in Sydney and meeting with members of the community over the weekend.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

I could see it in their eyes. I could hear it in their voices,\" DeVries said.\"People were crying. People were screaming. It was a nightmare.\"DeVries said he was also surprised by the lack of security at the eventKirk was speaking at a debate hosted by his nonprofit political organisation. The event had been met with divided opinions on campus.An online petition calling for university administrators to bar Kirk from appearing received nearly 1000 signatures.The university issued a statement last week citing First Amendment rights and affirming its \"commitment to free speech, intellectual inquiry, and constructive dialogue.\"Last week, Kirk posted on X images of news clips showing his visit to Utah colleges was sparking controversy. He wrote, \"What&#x27;s going on in Utah?\"The college said a \"single shot\" had been fired at Kirk and a suspect was in custody.Police later named two people who were arrested and released following Kirk&#x27;s assasination.Utah Police said George Zinn was initially arrested as a suspect but has since been released after being charged with obstruction by UVU police.A second suspect, Zachariah Qureshi, was also taken into custody and released after an interrogation.READ MORE: Prince Harry reunites with his father, King CharlesTrump leads tributes Trump paid tribute to Kirk on social media.\"The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead,\" he said.\"No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie.\"He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.

Working with the FBI and Utah law enforcement, we will bring to justice the individual responsible for this tragedy,\" Cox wrote on X.\"Abby and I are heartbroken. We are praying for Charlie&#x27;s wife, daughter, and son,\" Cox added.The shooting comes amid a spike in political violence in the US across all parts of the ideological spectrum.READ MORE: New NASA Mars rover findings provide strongest hints yet of potential ancient lifeThe attacks include the assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband at their house in June, the firebombing of a Colorado parade to demand Hamas release hostages, and a fire set at the house of Pennsylvania&#x27;s governor, who is Jewish, in April.The most notorious of these events is the shooting of Trump during a campaign rally last year.Former Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz, a Republican who was at the event, said in an interview on Fox News Channel that he heard one shot and saw Kirk go back.\"It seemed like it was a close shot,\" Chaffetz said, who seemed shaken as he spoke.He said there was a light police presence at the event and Kirk had some security but not enough.\"Utah is one of the safest places on the planet,\" he said.\"And so we just don&#x27;t have these types of things.\"Turning Point was founded in suburban Chicago in 2012 by Kirk, then 18, and William Montgomery, a Tea Party activist, to proselytise on college campuses for low taxes and limited government. It was not an immediate success.But Kirk&#x27;s zeal for confronting liberals in academia eventually won over an influential set of conservative financiers.Despite early misgivings, Turning Point enthusiastically backed Trump after he clinched the GOP nomination in 2016. Kirk served as a personal aide to Donald Trump Jr, the president&#x27;s eldest son, during the general election campaign.Soon, Kirk was a regular presence on cable TV, where he leaned into the culture wars and heaped praise on the then-president. Trump and his son were equally effusive and often spoke at Turning Point conferences.",
