          "content": "Britain has sanctioned Russia&#x27;s GRU military intelligence agency and summoned Moscow&#x27;s ambassador after an inquiry concluded that President Vladimir Putin was responsible for a nerve agent attack on British soil in 2018.The government said on Thursday that the GRU was being sanctioned in its entirely for \"reckless\" acts including the attack in the city of Salisbury that targeted Sergei Skripal, a former GRU officer who was imprisoned in Russia in 2006 for spying for Britain. He was released as part of a 2010 spy swap and settled in the UK.Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal became seriously ill in March 2018 after being exposed to the nerve agent Novichok, which had been smeared on the handle of the ex-spy&#x27;s front door. A police officer, Nick Bailey, also was sickened. All three survived.READ MORE: Former NRL star charged with strangling childThree months later, a British woman, Dawn Sturgess, and her partner collapsed after they found a discarded perfume bottle containing Novichok. Sturgess had sprayed the contents of the bottle on her wrist and died days later. Her partner survived.Moscow has denied any role in the poisonings. In 2018, Putin dismissed Sergei Skripal as \"just a scumbag\" of no interest to the Kremlin.Former UK Supreme Court Justice Anthony Hughes, who led an inquiry into Sturgess&#x27; death, said that the attack on the Skripals \"must have been authorised at the highest level\" by Putin.He concluded that Sturgess was \"an innocent victim of an attempt by officers of a Russian state organisation to conduct an assassination on the streets of Salisbury using a highly toxic nerve agent\".Britain has charged three alleged GRU agents over the attack on the Skripals, but the UK has no extradition agreement with Russia, so there is little prospect of putting them on trial.Novichok is a class of military-grade nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War. Western weapons experts believe it was only ever manufactured in Russia, though Moscow has said that the US, UK and other countries have the expertise to make it.The UK sanctions announcement also named eight alleged cyber military intelligence officers for working for the GRU. Britain&#x27;s Foreign Office said that they targeted Yulia Skripal with malware five years before the Novichok attack.Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that Hughes&#x27; findings \"are a grave reminder of the Kremlin&#x27;s disregard for innocent lives\".\"Dawn&#x27;s needless death was a tragedy and will forever be a reminder of Russia&#x27;s reckless aggression,\" he said.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "The FBI has made an arrest in its nearly five-year-old investigation into who placed pipe bombs in Washington on the eve of the January six, 2021, riot at the US Capitol, a law enforcement official has told The Associated Press.The arrest marks the first time investigators have settled on a suspect in an act that had long vexed law enforcement, spawned a multitude of conspiracy theories and remained an enduring mystery in the shadow of the dark chapter of American history that is the violent Capitol siege.The official who described the arrest was not authorised to publicly discuss a case that has not yet been made public and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The arrest took place Thursday morning, and the suspect is a man, the official said. No other details were immediately available, including the charges the man might face.READ MORE: Former NRL star charged with strangling childThe pipe bombs were placed on the evening of January 5, 2021, near the offices of the Democratic and Republican national committees in the District of Columbia. Nobody was hurt before the bombs were rendered safe, but the FBI has said both devices could have been lethal.In the years since, investigators have sought the public&#x27;s help in identifying a shadowy subject seen on surveillance camera even as they struggled to determine answers to basic questions, including the person&#x27;s gender and motive and whether the act had a clear connection to the riot at the Capitol a day later when supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the building in a bid to halt the certification of the Republican&#x27;s 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.Seeking a breakthrough, the FBI last January publicised additional information about the investigation, including an estimate that the suspect was about 1.7 metres, as well as previously unreleased video of the suspect placing one of the bombs.The bureau had for years struggled to pinpoint a suspect despite hundreds of tips, a review of tens of thousands of video files and a significant number of interviews.In the absence of harder evidence, Republican politicians and right-wing media outlets promoted conspiracy theories about the pipe bombs.READ MORE: Man dies after being pulled from ocean pool READ MORE: Three teenagers charged over alleged beach brawlHouse Republicans also criticised security lapses, questioning how law enforcement failed to detect the bombs for 17 hours.Dan Bongino, the current FBI deputy director, floated the possibility last year before being tapped for his job that the act was an \"inside job\" and involved a \"massive cover-up\".But since arriving at the FBI in March, he has sought to deliver action to a restive base on the far right by promising that the pipe bombs investigation would be a top priority and defending the bureau&#x27;s work.We brought in new personnel to take a look at the case, we flew in police officers and detectives working as TFOs (task force officers) to review FBI work, we conducted multiple internal reviews, held countless in person and SVTC meetings with investigative team members, we dramatically increased investigative resources, and we increased the public award for information in the case to utilise crowd-sourcing leads,\" he wrote in a long post on X last month.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
