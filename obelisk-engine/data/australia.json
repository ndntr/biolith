The pair were found critically injured on the street about 200 metres apart in what police have described as having \"the hallmarks of a youth gang crime\". Neighbours reported hearing their screams and rushed outside to help but it was too late.\" It&#x27;s absolutely shocking that not one, but two could happen so close to home, at 8 o&#x27;clock at night,\" one neighbour told 9News.Police said the victims weren&#x27;t gang members and were investigating if their deaths were a horrific case of mistaken identity.The boy&#x27;s grieving family and friends are pleading for justice.Dau&#x27;s father said he needed answers for his son.\"This is a basketball player, he&#x27;s not a criminal,\" Elbino Akueng said.\"I&#x27;m talking on behalf of my community, this is happening to us.READ MORE: Man dies after early morning shooting in Melbourne&#x27;s CBD\"In the last month, we have buried four kids, similar incidents keep happening, but there&#x27;s no answer from police.\" Emergency services first found Chol, who paramedics tried to resuscitate but couldn&#x27;t save.Chol&#x27;s father, Cauti Nuong, described him as a \"good boy\" who was very clever.\"Very intelligent, he&#x27;s always so active,\" he told 9News. Detective Inspector Graham Banks said Dau, 15, was found dead a short time later nearby on Cobble Street as a result of \"significant injuries consistent with being stabbed\".He added that Chol and Dau were not gang members.
