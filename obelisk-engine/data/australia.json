READ MORE: Mass power outages, severe weather warnings as destructive winds pick up \"It&#x27;s an association,\" Diabetes Australia chief medical officer Professor David Simmons said. \"So that doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s causal. It just means that there is this increased likelihood.\"Researchers said further study is still needed to fully examine the link.\"Longer follow-ups across childhood are also needed to examine whether these associations persist or progress further to other worse outcomes,\" presenting author Caitlin Por from Monash University said.Gestational diabetes, the fastest-growing type of diabetes in Australia, affects almost one in five pregnant women. While routine testing typically occurs between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation, experts suggest that detection as early as 10 weeks could help with treatment. \"It&#x27;d be great to be able to prevent gestational diabetes, otherwise, we certainly want to try to diagnose it and find it as early as possible,\" Simmons said.READ MORE: Family seeks answers after Gold Coast mum stabbed, burnt to death The study noted that it&#x27;s not clear how gestational diabetes affects a child&#x27;s brain development but said there are several possible explanations.\"There are increasing concerns about the neurotoxic effects of gestational diabetes on the developing brain,\" lead senior author Assistant Professor Dr Ling-Jun Li from the National University of Singapore said. \"Our findings underscore the urgency of addressing this significant public health concern that poses substantial cognitive dysfunction risks for both mothers and offspring.\"Inflammation, stress in the body&#x27;s cells, and reduced oxygen supply were cited as factors that could play a role in how the baby develops in the womb and then later affect the child&#x27;s development. \"(We) just need to be mindful or checking our children if we are concerned something is wrong,\" Jane Robinson from Diabetes Victoria said.\"But there is no need for alarm.\"She added that remaining physically active, eating a healthy diet and keeping a health weight range when preparing for pregnancy are important in helping prevent gestational diabetes.This article was produced with the assistance of 9ExPress.",
