          "content": "A state of disaster has been declared in parts of Victoria as hundreds of firefighters continue to battle out-of-control bushfires that have left three people unaccounted for. The announcement comes after several new emergency warnings were issued overnight for multiple spots, warning residents to \"take shelter now\".More than 60 fires ignited yesterday in the worst conditions since the 2019 Black Summer bushfires.LIVE UPDATES: The latest on the Victorian bushfire disaster Four out-of-control blazes are continuing to ravage the state with it now considered \"too late to leave\" for people near three of them, including:Alpine National Park fire - Arbuckle, Billabong, Black Snake Creek, Blomford, Briagolong, Budgee Budgee, Castleburn, Cobbannah, Cowa, Crooked River, Dargo, Gibbs, Glenaladale, Grant, Hawkhurst, Hogtown, Howittville, Hunter Corner, Iguana Creek, Maguires, Miowera, Moornapa, Moroka, Naarun, Peter the Swede, Shepherdson, Talbotville, Toolome, Treasure, Treasures, Valencia Creek, Waterford, Winchester, Wongungarra, Woolenook, Wrathung.Longwood fire - Acheron, Limestone, Whanregarwen, Yea.Walwa fire - Biggara, Corryong, Cudgewa, Pine Mountain, Thowgla, Thowgla Valley, Tintaldra, Tom Groggin, Towong.LIVE UPDATES: Get all of the latest Vic Emergency warnings here After a cool change swept across the state on Friday evening dropping temperatures, a number of blazes were downgraded in severity.The positive news came after firefighters worked across the day to contain several emergency level bushfires.An out-of-control grass fire in Ravenwood South sparked a warning to \"leave immediately\" for those in Elphinstone, Harcourt North, Metcalfe, Sedgwick and Sutton Grange last night.But authorities warn the situation is still volatile and conditions can change quickly, so want people to stay prepared. Hours after pleading with Victorians to heed warnings from emergency services, Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan doubled down on her message, while revealing her own community had been evacuated.\"I&#x27;ve just received another briefing by the Emergency Management Commissioner at the State Control Centre,\" Allan wrote on social media. READ MORE: Small town of Ruffy unrecognisable as fire destroys homes\"So many communities across Victoria are being told to leave tonight, including mine.\"I&#x27;m thinking about my neighbours. Friends. And all families across the state facing the same decision - leaving homes they love to protect the people they love most.\"I cannot be any clearer.\"If you are told to leave - do not wait. Follow the advice. Leave now.\"The Longwood fire has burned through almost 150,000 hectares and has decimated more than 20 homes, including a school, as residents across dozens of towns have been forced to evacuate.Another major fire, the Walwa blaze, has burned through more than 100,000 hectares in the state&#x27;s north-east.A total fire ban remains in place across Victoria today, meaning no fires can be lit or be allowed to remain alight in the open air from 12.01am through until 11.59pm.But in a glimmer of hope after the difficult conditions over the last few days, the CFA&#x27;s map for today shows the whole state is down to the yellow-toned \"High\" level.This follows yesterday&#x27;s red \"Catastrophic\" and orange \"Extreme\" fire danger across the state. By Sunday, the map shows shades of \"Moderate\" green with no total fire ban as yet declared for the end of the weekend.Family-of-three still missing in Victorian bushfiresA family-of-three remains unaccounted for after a fire ripped through their home in the Longwood East area on Thursday.Authorities hold concerns for the man, woman and child who firefighters spoke with at their home in the morning, before crews returned in the afternoon to find the property destroyed by fire.\"Those three people , we do not know at this point in time where they may be,\" Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Bob Hill said this morning.\"At this point in time, I&#x27;m not suggesting we&#x27;ve seen three people perish, all I&#x27;m saying is these three people are unaccounted for.\"Emergency services are currently unable to investigate their disappearance as the area is still a danger zone but the trio remain unaccounted for this evening.Victoria&#x27;s Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch confirmed \"community and residential\" properties have been destroyed in the Longwood fire.Many of these losses have been in and around the Ruffy area.Wiebusch said the number of properties destroyed could not yet be confirmed, but that the Ruffy community centre and telephone exchange had been destroyed, along with multiple homes.READ MORE: Forecasters say 50-60 per cent chance cyclone will cross Queensland coast Wiebusch said firefighters would face \"challenging and difficult\" conditions across the state.\"Victoria is in the midst of a severe to extreme intensity heatwave, which is now being matched with damaging winds and storms today, that will result in our state seeing catastrophic and extreme fire danger,\" Wiebusch said.\"That means that any fires that are in our landscape already or those that start will be uncontrollable, unpredictable and will be very fast-moving.\"CFA Captain George Noye, who was visibly emotional this afternoon, told 9News the fire has cleared homes, buildings and livestock.\"There&#x27;s not much left. It&#x27;s just ash,\" Noye said.\"If we go away to a lot of fires and we see this happen with communities, it&#x27;s devastating.\"Earlier this morning, Noye said the damage in Ruffy looked like \"an atomic bomb has gone off\".\"We&#x27;ve lost the old school, the old Ruffy produce store is gone, three houses on the main street, we&#x27;ve lost countless homes across the area,\" he told ABC.\"Ten of my firefighters that I know of have lost homes.\"READ MORE: &#x27;Expect to lose power&#x27;: Queenslanders in path of likely cyclone urged to prepare There are fears the potential impact zone of the Longwood fire could creep towards Melbourne&#x27;s fringes due to last night&#x27;s wind change.It&#x27;s also feared the winds could blow a fire in Victoria, south of the Murray River about 50 kilometres east of Albury, into NSW.This has prompted NSW Rural Fire Service to join efforts at the border to help fight the fire and prevent it from crossing state lines, ahead of extreme heat conditions across the south-east this weekend. The mercury spiked to 46.5 degrees at Walpeup, in the Mallee region, and peaked at 44.4 degrees in Melbourne, making it the city&#x27;s hottest day since the Black Summer of 2019-2020.LIVE UPDATES: Find the latest weather warnings here.Temperatures are expected to cool across most of the state today, but the mercury is expected to nudge 40 in some areas including Geelong and Mildura.A high of 26 degrees is forecast for Melbourne.A severe heatwave warning remains in place for people in the Mallee, Wimmera, Central and South West districts .The extreme heatwave conditions are set to ease from the west over the weekend, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, as the milder change extends across the state.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Video captured by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent Jonathan Ross gives a raw, up-close perspective of the pivotal moments surrounding his fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis.A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official confirmed the video, obtained by CNN, was recorded on the agent&#x27;s cellphone camera; the video was originally obtained by the conservative Minnesota media outlet Alpha News.Vice President JD Vance shared it, saying it shows the officer was endangered.READ MORE: FBI won&#x27;t co-operate with state investigators in ICE shooting case \"Watch this, as hard as it is. Many of you have been told this law enforcement officer wasn&#x27;t hit by a car, wasn&#x27;t being harassed, and murdered an innocent woman. The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self-defence,\" Vance posted on X.The video begins with Ross in front of the vehicle driven by Good, who had stopped her burgundy SUV perpendicular to the street, obstructing the flow of traffic. Ross does not say anything as he walks across the front of the car toward the driver&#x27;s side of the car.As he rounds the car, Good can be seen with her window down looking directly at the officer.In the video, Good then talks to Ross.\"That&#x27;s fine dude. I&#x27;m not mad at you,\" she says. Ross does not respond. In the car window a reflection can be seen of Ross, holding his phone up, as he continues to walk. You can also hear the victim&#x27;s wife, Becca Good, say \"show your face\" to Ross.The video shows Ross walking around to the back of the car. Becca Good, the passenger in the car, who had gotten out of the vehicle prior to the confrontation, tells Ross that, \"We don&#x27;t change our plates every morning, just so you know. This will be the same plate when you come talk to us later.\"She holds a mobile phone up to Ross&#x27;s face as she addresses Ross.READ MORE: Video shows how Minnesota ICE shooting unfolded\"You wanna come at us? You wanna come at us? I say go get yourself some lunch, big boy,\" she says to Ross. She then tries to get back in the car, but the door is locked.You then hear another officer tell Good, the driver, to \"get out of the fucking car.\"Good is then seen reversing the car and glancing forward as she turns the steering wheel to the right, away from where the officer is standing. The car moves forward, and Ross cries out \"whoa\" and then three gunshots are heard in rapid succession.The video does not show if the SUV made contact with Ross, as the camera angle jerks up to the sky. An earlier video shot by a bystander shows that the SUV may have made contact with Ross as it lurches forward, and he moves to the side.DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the newly released video backs up what the agency has said – that the ICE agent acted in self-defence.READ MORE: US federal immigration agents shoot two people in car \"This footage corroborates what DHS has stated all along – that this individual was impeding law enforcement and weaponised her vehicle in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to federal law enforcement. The officer was in fear of his own life, the lives of his fellow officers and acted in self-defence. The American people can watch this video with their own eyes and ears and judge for themselves,\" McLaughlin said in a statement on Friday.The shooting itself is not visible, but three gunshots are heard as the phone in his hand jostles further and then is facing the house behind Ross.The camera then captures the SUV as it barrels forward. Someone can be heard uttering \"f—ing bitch\".The impact of the SUV crashing into a parked car can be heard as well as the camera pans down to the street.READ MORE: Was an ICE officer allowed to open fire at a driver?
