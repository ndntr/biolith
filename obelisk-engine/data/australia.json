The Washington Post source who read a translated transcript of an audio recording of Khashoggi&#x27;s painful last moments said it was clear that the killing on October 2 was no botched rendition attempt, but the execution of a premeditated plan to murder the journalist.During the course of the gruesome scene, the source describes Khashoggi struggling against a group of people determined to kill him.\"I can&#x27;t breathe,\" Khashoggi says.\"I can&#x27;t breathe.\"I can&#x27;t breathe.\"The transcript notes the sounds of Khashoggi&#x27;s body being dismembered by a saw, as the alleged perpetrators are advised to listen to music to block out the sound.And, according to the source, the transcript suggests that a series of phone calls were made. Turkish officials believe the calls were placed to senior figures in Riyadh, briefing them on progress.Sign up here to receive our daily newsletters and breaking news alerts, sent straight to your inbox.",
