          "content": "Cheers erupted among Palestinians on Monday as Israel released nearly 2000 prisoners under a Gaza ceasefire agreement that saw them exchanged for Israeli hostages freed by Hamas.Large crowds greeted the freed prisoners in Beitunia in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Khan Younis in Gaza, flashing V-for-victory signs as they descended from International Committee of the Red Cross buses. In Beitunia, they were given traditional keffiyeh scarves as a show of nationalist pride. Some were lifted onto people&#x27;s shoulders. Others sank into chairs, exhausted.\"It was an indescribable journey of suffering — hunger, unfair treatment, oppression, torture and curses — more than anything you could imagine,\" said Kamal Abu Shanab, a 51-year-old Fatah member from the West Bank town of Tulkarem.READ MORE: Trump bathes in Israeli praise as final living hostages freedHis face was gaunt. He said he lost 59 kilograms in prison.\"We don&#x27;t recognise him. He&#x27;s not the person we knew. Our uncle doesn&#x27;t look like our uncle,\" said his niece, Farah Abu Shanab.Those freed include about 1700 of the several thousand Palestinians that Israeli troops seized from Gaza during the two-year war and have held without charge.Also among those released were 250 Palestinians sentenced to prison terms, most of them convicted for deadly attacks on Israelis dating back decades as well as others convicted on lesser charges, according to Israel&#x27;s Justice Ministry. Of those, Israel exiled 154, sending them to neighbouring Egypt, where officials said they will be sent to third countries.The rest were returning to homes in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.A profound momentThe releases have powerful resonance on both sides.For Israelis, they&#x27;re deeply painful, since some of those released were convicted over attacks that killed civilians and soldiers. For Palestinians, the issue of prisoners is politically charged. Nearly everyone has a friend or family member who has been jailed by Israel, particularly young men.READ MORE: Tears of joy as the living Israeli hostages are returned While Israel views the prisoners as terrorists, many Palestinians consider them as freedom fighters resisting a decades-long Israeli military occupation. Reports from rights groups detailing conditions while held — including isolation, abuse and illness — have made prisoners prominent symbols of their people&#x27;s political struggle.In Khan Younis, thousands of people cheered and celebratory gunfire rang in the air. The freed Palestinians filed out wearing gray jumpsuits and entered the hospital for medical examinations.Israeli forces detained thousands of Palestinians during the war in raids on shelters and hospitals and at checkpoints stopping families as they fled their homes amid military operations.Families often had no idea their relatives had been detained, and it often took months to determine if they were in Israeli custody, if confirmation came at all. Most were held under laws passed in Israel at the start of the war that allowed Palestinians to be detained for months as \"unlawful combatants\" without judicial review or access to lawyers.Rights groups, the UN and detainees have reported routine abuse in the detention facilities, including beatings and insufficient food.Israel says it adheres to its prison standards under law and investigates any reports of violations.Monday&#x27;s release still leaves about 1300 Palestinians from Gaza in Israeli custody, according to a count of detainees in September by the Israeli human rights group Hamoked.Warnings not to celebrateCelebrations in the West Bank occurred despite Israeli warnings against doing so. A flier circulated saying anyone supporting what it called \"terrorist organisations\" risked arrest.Palestinians had gathered on hills overlooking Ofer Prison. An armoured Israeli vehicle drove up and fired tear gas and rubber bullets. As drones buzzed overhead, the crowd scattered.Israel&#x27;s military did not respond to questions.Who is on the listAccording to a list issued by Hamas, the Gaza detainees freed include two women, six teenagers under 18 and about 30 men over 60.The list of 250 convicted prisoners freed, ranging in age from 19 to 64, includes 159 affiliated with Fatah, the political party that runs the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, and 63 associated with Hamas. The remainder are unaffiliated or belong to other groups.Many were arrested in the early 2000s, which saw the eruption of the Second Intifada, a Palestinian uprising fuelled by anger over continued Israeli occupation despite years of peace talks. Palestinian armed groups carried out attacks that killed hundreds of Israelis, and the Israeli military killed several thousand Palestinians.Some were convicted in military trials that rights advocates say often lack due process. Others have been incarcerated for months or years without trial in what is known as administrative detention. Israel says the practice, widely criticised by Palestinians and human rights groups, is needed to prevent attacks and avoid sharing sensitive intelligence.The Hamas list did not include roughly half a dozen highest-profile prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti, Hassan Salameh, Ahmed Saadat and Abbas Al-Sayyed. Barghouti is widely seen as a potential successor to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.A list of released prisoners issued by Israel includes the following:Raed SheikhA 51-year-old Palestinian police officer and Fatah member, Sheikh was sentenced to multiple life terms in 2000 for his role in the killing of two Israeli soldiers who were attacked by a mob at a West Bank police station, including one thrown from the station&#x27;s window.Mahmoud IssaA 57-year-old Hamas commander imprisoned for life in 1993 — before the Oslo interim peace accords — Issa was among those convicted of kidnapping and killing a 29-year-old Israeli border police officer that year. Much of his more than three decades behind bars were spent in solitary confinement, conditions that have made him a symbol among prisoners&#x27; rights advocates.Shamasneh brothersThe two brothers — 56-year-old Mohammed and 62-year-old Abdel Jawad Shamasneh — were in 1993 sentenced to multiple life terms for their role in a stabbing attack that killed Israeli hitchhikers whose bodies were later found in a Jerusalem riverbed in 1990 during the first Palestinian intifada.Iyad FataftaA 47-year-old Fatah member serving a life sentence, Fatafta was one of two men convicted of murder for stabbing American tourist Kristine Luken and a friend who was hiking with her and survived.",

          "content": "The last 20 living hostages held in Gaza have been released, reuniting with their families in jubilant scenes as world leaders gathered in Egypt to discuss the future of Gaza and the next phases of the US-brokered ceasefire deal.For the first time in more than two years, Hamas and its allies are not holding any living hostages in Gaza.Meanwhile, 1718 Palestinian detainees who were being held in Israel without charge were released on Monday and returned to Gaza. Israel also released 250 Palestinians serving long-term sentences.READ MORE: Four dead hostages returned to Israel with psalm and flag ceremonyAddressing the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, on Monday during his trip to the Middle East, US President Donald Trump said the \"long and painful nightmare is finally over.\"\"This is a historic dawn of a new Middle East,\" Trump told Israeli lawmakers.The remaining 20 living hostages were released in two groups on Monday, prompting elation and relief throughout Israel.READ MORE: Trump calls for end to &#x27;old feuds&#x27; in Middle East peace speechIn Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, large crowds cheered, waved flags and chanted \"thank you, Trump!\" as news of the hostages&#x27; freedom was announced.Emotional scenes unfolded at the Re&#x27;im military facility in southern Israel, where the released hostages were reunited with their immediate families after more than two years in captivity.In footage shared by the Israeli military, 24-year-old Guy Gilboa-Dalal, who was kidnapped from the Nova music festival, was met by his parents and siblings. His family cried and embraced him in a large hug.READ MORE: Tears across Israel as living hostages reunite with familiesOmri Miran, 48, who was kidnapped when Hamas gunmen broke into his family&#x27;s home in kibbutz Nahal Oz, was met by his wife Lishay Miran-Lavi and his father Dani Miran.Photos showed him playing with his children for the first time in more than two years.\"We are at the beginning of a complex and challenging, yet moving, journey of recovery,\" Miran&#x27;s family said in a statement.READ MORE: Palestinians celebrate as prisoners are released by IsraelTrump calls for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be pardoned In his speech US President Donald Trump called for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be pardoned on corruption charges while declaring victory for Israel in its two-year war in Gaza.He bathed in waves of adulation from Israeli leaders for more than an hour before giving his own lengthy speech to Israel&#x27;s parliament on Monday.The local politicians hailed their guest as a hero, crediting him with achieving peace and getting the hostages home from Hamas captivity.READ MORE: Tears of joy as the living Israeli hostages are returned Two members of the Knesset were ejected after interrupting with their call to recognise a Palestinian state but the atmosphere was an overwhelming one of a victory lap for Trump, his team and Netanyahu.Trump had already declared the war to be \"over\", despite the ceasefire only being in its very early stages with many tricky elements of the peace plan still ahead.He appeared to go one step further while urging Israel to look away from the battlefield and towards what he hoped would be peace in the region \"for the rest of eternity\".\"So Israel, with our help has won all that they can by force of arms,\" he says.\"You&#x27;ve won. I mean, you&#x27;ve won. \"Now it&#x27;s time to translate these victories against terrorists on the battlefield into the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity for the entire Middle East. \"It&#x27;s about time you were able to enjoy the fruits of your labour.\" The president also promised to help rebuild Gaza, where Israel&#x27;s offensive has killed 67,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, in retaliation for the October 7, 2023 attacks in Southern Israel.Hamas militants killed 1200 people, mostly civilians and took 251 hostages, the last living ones of whom were returned to Israel on Monday. Families were still waiting for the remains of 28 hostages.Trump said Palestinians in Gaza should spend time on \"building their people up, instead of trying to tear Israel down\".\"The choice for Palestinians could not be more clear,\" he said. \"This is their chance to turn forever from the path of terror and violence ... to exile the wicked forces of hate that are in their midst. \"And I think that&#x27;s going to happen. I&#x27;ve met some people over the last couple of months that want to see it happen very much.\"Palestinians rejoice at release of detainees from IsraelPalestinians in the occupied West Bank and elsewhere rejoiced as Israel said it had released more then 1900 detainees as part of the ceasefire deal.Waving flags and wearing keffiyehs, hundreds gathered outside the Ramallah Palace of Culture to greet them one such release.Reports by human rights groups detailing conditions in Israeli detention have made Palestinian prisoners enduring symbols of their people&#x27;s struggle.\"It was an indescribable journey of suffering — hunger, unfair treatment, oppression, torture and curses — more than anything you could imagine,\" said Kamal Abu Shanab, a 51-year-old Fatah member from Tulkarem.Most prisoners were serving long sentences for their involvement in deadly attacks against Israelis.An Egyptian official said 154 Palestinian prisoners who were released and deported by Israel arrived in Egypt at the Rafah crossing with Gaza.Huge job ahead for aid workers in GazaAs the UN distributed hundreds of thousands of hot meals and bread bundles in southern and northern Gaza on Monday, Perth woman Tess Ingram, a UNICEF spokesperson, was among those back in the occupied territory to help.\"I think that optimism is mixed with a sense of grief and loss among people as they realise what has been taken from them over the last two years,\" she told A Current Affair, agreeing that it did feel like the war was \"over\" on the ground.\"I&#x27;m in Gaza city in the north, where I&#x27;ve spoken to families who&#x27;ve just returned here after the intense Israeli bombardment of the last two months, and they&#x27;re finding their homes and their neighborhoods in ruins.\"Ingram, whose UNICEF vehicle was hit with bullets while working in Gaza last year, drove though the east and northern parts of Gaza City yesterday and described it as a \"skeleton city\".\"There&#x27;s no life, no colour, just bones,\" she said.\"And it really affects you to see that at such a dramatic scale.\"She said the agency&#x27;s first priority was basic survival needs such as food, clean drinking water and medicine, before turning to preparing children for the winter.\"They don&#x27;t have blankets and children need winter clothes,\" she told A Current Affair.\"One of our aims for this ceasefire is to try and give every child under 10 a set of winter clothes and a new pair of shoes.\"Trump on whirlwind trip to Middle EastThe US president was set to continue to Egypt for a peace summit with more than two dozen other nations, although he was running hours late as speeches at the Knesset continued longer than expected.\"They might not be there by the time I get there, but we&#x27;ll give it a shot,\" Trump joked after needling Israeli leaders for talking so much.He stepped on to Air Force One at Ben Gurion Airport in Jerusalem about 4.15pm on Monday (12.15am Tuesday AEDT) and touched down at Sharm El-Sheikh International Airport not long after for the summit in the Red Sea resort.Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi praised Trump as the \"only one\" who could bring peace to the region.During an impromptu bilateral meeting, Trump called el-Sissi \"very powerful\" and noted that there is \"no crime\" in Egypt.There had been a chance that Netanyahu would join, and Egypt even announced his attendance. However, Netanyahu&#x27;s office said later that he would not be going because the summit was too close to the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah.Trump pushes to reshape the regionThe moment remains fragile, with Israel and Hamas still in the early stages of implementing the first phase of Trump&#x27;s plan.The first phase of the ceasefire agreement calls for the release of the final hostages held by Hamas; the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel; a surge of humanitarian aid to Gaza; and a partial pullback by Israeli forces from Gaza&#x27;s main cities.With families overjoyed at the impending reunions and Palestinians eager for a surge of humanitarian assistance, Trump thinks there is a narrow window to reshape the region and reset long-fraught relations between Israel and its Arab neighbours.\"Generations from now, this will be remembered as the moment that everything began to change,\" he told the Knesset.- Reported with Associated Press",

I just want to hug him,\" Ohel&#x27;s cousin, Noam Rozen, 24, said before choking up.READ MORE: For some, saving hostages means freeing militants who killed loved oneshttps://x.com/IDF/status/1977688830938693690By midday, 13 more hostages were freed, bringing the final number of the living hostages released to 20.With other members of his family, and dozens of supporters cheering, Rozen took down one of the hostage posters that had long been hanging by the village&#x27;s entrance and replaced it with a banner saying in Hebrew: \"Welcome back home — the heart returned to beating and now we can breathe.\"The wait on a Galilee hilltop villageHundreds had been packing the small community centre of the hilltop village of Lavon in the Galilee since before dawn for one of the most important days of their lives — when the last 20 living hostages were scheduled to be released, first to the Red Cross and then to the Israeli military, as part of a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.\"I told God many months ago, &#x27;If Alon is coming home, I bring shofar and I say thank you for this,&#x27;\" said Yaniv Shema Zion, who&#x27;s known Ohel since he was a toddler.Wearing T-shirts emblazoned with pictures of Ohel, people from Lavon waved flags, sang hymns, hugged and wiped away tears before falling silent in front of the projected screen carrying images from Gaza of the release.READ MORE: Thousands of Palestinians return to what remains of their homeshttps://www.facebook.com/idfonline/posts/pfbid02QgXWwquruCcWVRxwWnWVhkXJ9ByA54ZAaX41jKzn8N7PyZhzQQPyYUTJTRqg6vd6l?__cft__ \"Knowing Alon, there was no chance not to get him back with us,\" his aunt, Nirit Ohel said, though she added the family was still worried about his health.Alon Ohel had had shrapnel in his eye from the October 7, 2023 attack on the bomb shelter in southern Israel where he had sought refuge.People in Lavon jumped on chairs and shouted with joy when the first images of Ohel were broadcast, showing him thin but smiling.People in Tel Aviv&#x27;s Hostages Square sobbed as photos of the hostages reuniting with their families flashed on the large screens. The names and faces of the hostages and their families have become household names across Israel over the past two years.Endless days in chainsOhel was kidnapped at the Nova music festival from a mobile bomb shelter along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an American-Israeli who was killed in captivity in August 2024.Eli Sharabi, another hostage held with Ohel and released in a previous ceasefire said they were kept chained, with only a moldy pita bread per day for food.READ MORE: Trump says Israel and Hamas agree to &#x27;first phase&#x27; of Gaza peace deal Ohel became a symbol of the hostage crisis because of his piano playing. At his mother&#x27;s initiative, pianos in his honour appeared across the country, including next to Jerusalem&#x27;s city hall and in Tel Aviv&#x27;s square devoted to the hostages.\"She wanted people to play and through it, to send their love to him,\" Nirit Ohel said.Another of Ohel&#x27;s aunts, Einat Rozen, said she was finally able to feel joy again, and praised the community&#x27;s support.\"Our community was with us all the time,\" she said, tears streaming down her face.The hostages&#x27; plightThe fate of the 251 hostages taken by Hamas-led militants in the attack on southern Israel just over two years ago, has weighed on every aspect of daily life in this country.Hostage posters and stickers are plastered everywhere — from seaside promenades to countryside bus stops — and many Israelis have been wearing yellow ribbons on their lapels, their wrists, their cars and their gardens for more than two years.Weekly vigils and protests were held in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and small communities like the Ohels&#x27; home of Lavon — 230 families in northern Galilee — bonded together to help the hostages&#x27; relatives. Tens of thousands gathered to watch news of the release.The country erupted with joy on Monday morning when the first group of the last 20 living hostages still held in Gaza were seen being transferred to the Red Cross as part of the ceasefire deal.\"I think what you are seeing here, the people that are celebrating in the square, something for me that is very Israeli, to see so many people gathering around to celebrate not the death of our enemies but the life of our people, of Israeli people,״ Gili Roman said as he and tens of thousands of others celebrated in Tel Aviv.His sister Yarden Roman-Gat was freed from Gaza during the first ceasefire in November 2023 but his sister-in-law Carmel Gat was killed in captivity last year.A long journeyIt&#x27;s the first step on a long journey to healing for the hostages, whose condition wasn&#x27;t immediately known. Another 28 who are believed deceased are also to be handed over to Israel as part of the deal, although when wasn&#x27;t clear.Many Israelis feel that the country won&#x27;t fully begin to recover from its collective trauma until their remains are brought back as well, bringing closure to their families too.Ruby Chen, father of Itay Chen, who is believed to be dead, said those with relatives who aren&#x27;t coming home alive will urge US President Donald Trump not to forget them.\"The hostage families meeting President Trump today will express from the bottom of their heart their sincere gratitude,\" Chen said. \"However we will also highlight the mission is not complete and we will not be able to begin to rehabilitate without the last deceased hostage returned to his family.\"For observant Jews, Monday held an extra special meaning.Both the October 7, 2023, attack and the release of hostages overlapped with the Jewish people&#x27;s celebration of the holiday of Simchat Torah, which marks the beginning of a new annual cycle of the reading of the scrolls. It is one of the most joyous days of the Jewish calendar, with festive dancing around a Torah.The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1200 people and taking 251 as hostages.In Israel&#x27;s ensuing offensive, more than 67,600 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to Gaza&#x27;s Health Ministry, which doesn&#x27;t differentiate between civilians and combatants but says around half the deaths were women and children. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, and the UN and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.",
