Even so, in the face of a violent and tragic incident, he responded with courage, instinct, and selflessness, continuing to protect and help others whilst injured, until he was physically no longer able to.Jack was simply doing his job - a job he deeply loves - driven by a commitment to protect the community, even at great personal cost.Many of his colleagues who were present on the night of the incident have visited in hospital and given testaments to Jack&#x27;s bravery during the incident, describing his devotion to his community. They described how Jack acted, he moved toward people in need, not away from danger, and continued helping others while seriously injured.READ MORE: Radio saved the life of Bondi terror attack victimThe support from the police force and hospital staff has been unmatched and we are beyond grateful.We thank the wider community for their kindness, support, and prayers for Jack and our family during this difficult time.We ask all to respect our privacy as we move through these next stages to support Jack and all his needs to a full recovery.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

READ MORE: Radio saved the life of Bondi terror attack victimSentencing judge Gregory Lyon acknowledged the \"psychological and emotional trauma\" of Silvagni&#x27;s victim when handing down his sentence. Judge Lyon also noted that Silvagni had suffered from a major depressive disorder in the time preceding and after his conviction.He described Silvagni&#x27;s prospects of rehabilitation as \"very good\" but said Silvagni had not demonstrated any remorse. Judge Lyon&#x27;s sentencing remarks went on to point out Silvagni had the support of a \"good, pro-social family\". Silvagni looked straight ahead on the video link from prison as Judge Lyon handed down his sentence today.His parents, AFL great Stephen Silvagni and television personality Jo Silvagni, who were in the courtroom, did not react to the jail term.The maximum jail term for rape is 25 years. At a pre-sentence hearing last week, barrister David Hallowes SC argued Silvagni should be handed a lighter sentence because he was a young man whose time in custody would be more difficult.Silvagni was found guilty of two counts of rape on December 5 following a two-week trial in the Victorian County Court.He denied he digitally raped his friend&#x27;s girlfriend at his Melbourne home in the early hours of January 14, 2024.The woman had consensual sex with her boyfriend at the house but then he organised an Uber and left the property shortly before 2am.Silvagni then lied, telling the woman her boyfriend would be returning upstairs because his Uber had been cancelled.But it was Silvagni who went into the dark bedroom a short time later and pretended to be the woman&#x27;s boyfriend before digitally raping her twice.There had been a suppression over his identity since he was first charged with rape in June 2024, with his lawyers arguing publication could lead to the deterioration of his mental health.-- Reported with AAPSupport is available from the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service at 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732).Readers seeking support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or beyond blue on 1300 22 4636.",
