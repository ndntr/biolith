The strong winds and falling trees have resulted in hundreds of SES calls, and around 1500 homes are currently without power.That&#x27;s just the beginning with storms expected to continue over the weekend.

          "content": "US President Donald Trump has said he will ask Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein&#x27;s ties to many other high-profile figures, in an extraordinary step that comes just days after Democrats released emails from the late Epstein that mention him.Trump announced the directive in a Truth Social post that accused Democrats of trying to revive attention to his past ties with Epstein, contending they are \"using the Epstein Hoax, involving Democrats, not Republicans, to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures.\"\"I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein&#x27;s involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,\" Trump wrote.READ MORE: Who else has been name-checked in the Epstein email trove? Bondi later on Friday confirmed she would launch the investigation on Trump&#x27;s orders, assigning Jay Clayton, the top prosecutor in New York&#x27;s southern district, to lead the federal probe.\"Thank you, Mr. President,\" she wrote in a post on X that included a screenshot of Trump&#x27;s request.The move represents the president&#x27;s most significant effort yet to discredit the push by Democrats and some Republicans to release all of the Epstein case files. And it serves as the latest example of Trump&#x27;s belief that he can defuse the issue through sheer force of will, despite deepening fears among allies that his actions are only further amplifying it while damaging his own credibility.\"Why doesn&#x27;t he just release these? Just release them!\" conservative podcast host Megyn Kelly said of the Epstein files during her show on Wednesday. \"Now he&#x27;s in a position of being, like, singled out as the only one, allegedly, as opposed to one of a slew of names.\"Trump earlier this week tried and failed to convince Republicans to block a discharge petition in the US House forcing a vote on the release of the Justice Department&#x27;s Epstein files, with the White House even holding a Situation Room meeting with one key GOP politician who had signed on ahead of it receiving its decisive 218th signature.READ MORE: Epstein claimed Trump knew about his conduct, emails say Officials during that meeting argued that the administration was not hiding anything, according to a senior White House official, including showing GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert unreleased documents obtained by the House Oversight Committee but they could not change her mind.The White House&#x27;s approach to the Epstein case and its subsequent fallout has perplexed even some administration officials and Trump allies, some of whom have been telling him and his advisers to change strategy for months.In recent days, at least one ally on Capitol Hill directly told Trump that he was getting bad advice on his approach to the Epstein case by continuing to delay and downplay it, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\"These people have no idea what advice the president is getting,\" another senior White House official said.The first senior White House official pushed back on the idea that the White House had been caught flat footed, noting that the administration, while aware of the emails, intentionally did not want to insert Epstein back into the news cycle. Asked about the message to the president from that congressional ally, a White House spokesperson reiterated that the emails released earlier this week \"prove literally nothing\" and pivoted to attacking Democrats for trying to use the Epstein \"hoax\" to distract from the shutdown.Multiple other sources told CNN that Trump himself has dictated the administration&#x27;s response to Epstein-related developments, specifically opposing any actions that risk pushing the storyline forward.\"Trump doesn&#x27;t want his people to get ahead of it. Everybody has been instructed to wait until information comes out and then respond that it is a hoax or doesn&#x27;t prove anything,\" one of the sources said.READ MORE: Former prince&#x27;s name changes again after royal decree foundIn the House, Speaker Mike Johnson now plans to schedule a vote on releasing the Epstein files next week, in a strategic shift spurred by the realisation that it could not be stopped. The vote is expected to attract significant support from rank-and-file GOP politicians.The president has declined to take questions from the press since the House Oversight Committee&#x27;s release on Wednesday of emails Epstein wrote that mentioned Trump by name. Trump did not receive or send any of the messages, which largely predate his time as president, and he has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.But on Friday, Trump again vented his frustration over the state of affairs in a series of Truth Social posts, blasting Republicans backing the Epstein files release as \"soft and foolish\" and repeatedly branding the issue a \"Hoax.\"\"This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats,\" Trump wrote in one post.He announced his demand for a Justice Department investigation into \"many other people and institutions\" in a subsequent Truth Social post.In thousands of emails reviewed by CNN, Epstein corresponded with a wide group of powerful and influential people, including prominent Democrats.Among his most frequent communications were with former Obama White House chief counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, who represented Epstein as his attorney, and Summers, the former Clinton Treasury secretary and Obama National Economic Council director. (Corresponding with Epstein would not be a crime, and there&#x27;s no evidence in the emails that any of them participated in Epstein&#x27;s wrongdoing.)CNN has reached out to Clinton, Summers and Hoffman.In a statement, JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Patricia Wexler said the bank \"ended our relationship with him years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges.\"JPMorgan paid $438,450,000 in 2023 to settle a class action lawsuit filed by Epstein&#x27;s survivors that alleged it turned a blind eye to unusual cash transactions that they claimed enabled Epstein&#x27;s sex trafficking. JPMorgan also paid $112,500,000 to settle with the US Virgin Islands. The bank did not admit or deny any wrongdoing in either settlement.\"The government had damning information about his crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks,\" Wexler said. \"We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts.\"READ MORE: White House pressuring Republicans not to vote on releasing Epstein files DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "D isgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein&#x27;s web of high-profile connections grows ever more complex with the release of thousands of new emails and correspondences by the US House Oversight Committee.US President Donald Trump again labelled the \"Epstein file\" a \"hoax\" after Democrats on the committee leaked three emails that mentioned Trump, including Epstein saying Trump \"knew about the girls\" Epstein&#x27;s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell was recruiting from Mar-a-Lago.But more revelations are emerging from among the 20,000-plus trove of documents that followed those initial three emails - and they aren&#x27;t all about Trump.The emails below have been left in their original text and contain some spelling and grammatical errors. READ MORE: BBC apologises to Donald Trump over misleading video editBill ClintonIn other emails, Epstein strategised how to respond to accuser Virginia Giuffre&#x27;s allegations, which included an account of meeting former president Bill Clinton on Epstein&#x27;s island in the Caribbean.\"Presidents at dinner on caribean islands. ( clinton was never ever there, easy to confirm ). Sharing a bath with a Prince ( bathtub too small even for one adult ). sex slave being paid thousands of dollars. ( while at the exact same time, she was working as a hostess in a burger bar ).\"Clinton has acknowledged travelling on Epstein&#x27;s private jet but has said through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of Epstein&#x27;s crimes.Clinton has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of the women who say Epstein abused them, including Giuffre. READ MORE: Missing priest&#x27;s body found wrapped in plastic in Mexico In a 2016 email to a reporter, Epstein denied ever spending time with Clinton or his vice president Al Gore on his island.\"You can also add, fresh politcal juice by stating that Clinton was never on the island,\" Epstein wrote.\"I never met Al Gore. No diners on the island either, no matter how much detail has been in the press.\"Andrew Mountbatten-WindsorThe new emails undercut the former Prince Andrew&#x27;s claim that a now-infamous snapshot of him with his arm around Giuffre&#x27;s partly bare midriff was doctored because he couldn&#x27;t remember it being taken.\"Yes she was on my plane, and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew as many of my employees have,\" Epstein wrote in one 2011 email in which he called Giuffre a liar.Epstein repeatedly disparaged Giuffre, calling her \"nothing more than a telephone answerer\".READ MORE: Watch: Russia&#x27;s landmark AI robot collapses in seconds on debut He discussed getting a reporter to investigate her, suggesting \"Buckingham Palace would love it\".When the Mail on Sunday sought comment before publishing a story in March 2011 about Giuffre&#x27;s allegations, Epstein forwarded the email to a contact listed as \"The Duke\" that is partly redacted but appears to be Mountbatten-Windsor.\"Please make sure that every statement or legal letter states clearly that I am NOT involved and that I knew and know NOTHING about any of these allegations,\" the reply from the email listed as \"The Duke\" said.\"I can&#x27;t take any more of this (on) my end.\"When he asked Epstein how he planned to respond to the tabloid&#x27;s request, Epstein said he wasn&#x27;t sure.\"The only person she didn&#x27;t have sex with was Elvis,\" he wrote.Ghislaine MaxwellIn January 2015, an anonymous woman – later revealed to be Giuffre – filed a lawsuit alleging that Epstein and Maxwell groomed and sexually abused her between 1998 and 2002.The lawsuit alleged they forced her to become a \"sex slave\" to powerful men – including a royal prince later revealed to be Mountbatten-Windsor.Mountbatten-Windsor has denied the allegation and later settled a lawsuit Giuffre filed against him.In several email exchanges on January 10, 2015, after the lawsuit was filed, Epstein and Maxwell coordinated their public response to the allegations.\"Initial response, too many unanswered question raised, relationship with jeffrey/…I am writing to writin to respond to alleagtinoin that have been made wchich are categorically untrue,\" Epstein wrote to Maxwell.Maxwell responded by asking if her lawyer could speak with a lawyer, then wrote: \"I have to distance myself from you in statement too. And they need me to say I was not aware of massage w/ andrew in my house. These things they have to stay along w/ meeting [REDACTED] and rebutting those allegations. I needs it asap.\"After Epstein assured Maxwell he was on the phone with his lawyer about getting her a lawyer, she replied, \"I need it written out in full.\"\"Call me,\" Epstein replied.Maxwell later settled a defamation lawsuit with Giuffre in June 2017 for an undisclosed sum.In an interview with the Justice Department this summer, Maxwell said her relationship with Epstein was \"almost nonexistent\" between 2010 and 2019 outside of corresponding over legal matters. Soon-Yi PrevinThe emails show an interesting exchange between Jeffrey Epstein and Soon-Yi Previn, the wife of controversial filmmaker Woody Allen.Epstein sent an article to Previn, titled, \"Bill Clinton&#x27;s CIA chief joins Trump campaign.\"The article, published by The Hill in September 2016, was about the former Clinton-appointed CIA director James Woolsey joining Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign.\"Woody said it doesn&#x27;t mean anything,\" Previn wrote in response to Epstein.It&#x27;s unclear why Epstein flagged the news to Previn and what, if any, interest she or her husband would have had in Woolsey&#x27;s involvement with Trump. Donald TrumpSo far, no correspondence between Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein has emerged, nor has Trump been accused of any wrongdoing in the documents released.But Epstein had plenty to say about his one-time friend.He called Trump \"borderline insane\" in a 2018 email exchange with former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.\"Trump – borderline insane,\" Epstein wrote on December 22, 2018.It&#x27;s unclear what prompted the exchange between Epstein and Summers. A week after Trump was inaugurated to his first term as US president, he signed an executive order banning the entry of foreign nationals from Muslim majority countries for 90 days, widely referred to as the \"Muslim ban\".Epstein said in an email to a New York Times reporter on January 28, 2017: \"IT helps as he is seen as keeping his word.\"He added later in the email: \"That being said Donald is f------ crazy, I told you that.\"In a March 24, 2018, email chain with Kathryn Ruemmler, a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama, Epstein shared a Daily Beast article titled, \"How Close Is Donald Trump to a Psychiatric Breakdown?\"The exchange shows Epstein forwarding the story early that morning to Ruemmler, with her replying: \"Not confidence inspiring.\"Epstein then responded: \"but – accurate.\"A year earlier in July 2017, Ruemmler wrote an email to Epstein saying, \"Trump is truly stupid.\"\"Duh,\" Epstein replied several hours later.It is not clear why Ruemmler and Epstein were corresponding at the time.In December 2018, Epstein emailed Ruemmler about Trump&#x27;s behaviour, writing:\"you might want to tell your dem friends that treating trump like a mafia don, ignores the fact that he has great dangerous power. tightening the noose too slowly, risks a very bad situation. gambino was never the commander in chief. there was little gambino could do as the walls closed in. not so with this maniac.\"In 2018, Epstein also questioned in an email with a reporter whether Trump was suffering from \"early dementia\". Steve BannonIn early June 2019, Trump made a state visit to the United Kingdom, where he was welcomed by the former Prince Andrew.A photo shows Andrew grinning as he shakes Trump&#x27;s hand.In a June 2019 email exchange with Steve Bannon, Trump&#x27;s former White House chief strategist, Epstein wrote, \"prince andrew and trump today.. Tooo [sic] funny.\" And then he added, \"recall prince andrews accuser came out of mara lago [sic].\"Bannon replied, \"Can&#x27;t believe nobody is making u [sic] the connective tissue.\"It&#x27;s unclear what exactly Bannon meant by the message.Trump fired him from the White House in 2017, though Bannon remained influential in conservative politics, as he does today.Trump and Andrew socialised together in the 1990s and 2000s, per newspaper reports, alongside Epstein and Maxwell, sometimes at Mar-A-Lago.CNN reached out to Bannon for comment but did not immediately hear back. Peter MandelsonThe new cache of documents from the House committee also seem to shed further light on the extent of the contact between Epstein and Peter Mandelson, who was recently fired as British ambassador to the US over his ties to Epstein.Emails show that the pair were in contact as late as 2016 when Mandelson appeared to reference Epstein&#x27;s birthday two weeks earlier.\"63 years old. You made it,\" he wrote.Their exchange also appears to suggest that Mandelson had cautioned Epstein to avoid Mountbatten-Windsor, with the disgraced financier writing that \"you were right about staying away from Andrew\".Mandelson responds, \"Yes, without Andrew it would not have gone nuclear.\"It&#x27;s unclear exactly what the two men are referring to.CNN has attempted to reach out to Mandelson for comment.Mandelson was fired as Britain&#x27;s ambassador to the US in September after Bloomberg published a trove of emails between him and Epstein which revealed the depth of their friendship.Those emails had shown that Mandelson had sent Epstein messages of support until 2010 – even after the sex offender was convicted of soliciting prostitution with a minor in Florida two years prior.- Reported with CNN and Associated Press.
