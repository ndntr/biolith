          "content": "Naveed Akram has been charged with 59 offences after a terrorist incident that claimed the lives of 15 people and injured 41 more at Bondi Beach on Sunday. The 24-year-old awoke from a coma in hospital yesterday, after he was critically shot and hospitalised during an alleged shootout with police. The NSW Joint Counter Terrorism Team, comprised of NSW Police, AFP, ASIO and the NSW Crime Commission, has this afternoon charged him with a slew of offences.READ MORE: Radio saved the life of Bondi terror attack victimThe offences include 15 counts of murder, committing a terrorist act, 40 counts of causing wounding/grievous bodily harm to a person with intent to murder, discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, causing public display of a prohibited terrorist org symbol and placing an explosive in/near a building with intent to cause harm.Earlier today, NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said police were waiting for him to recover before pressing charges. \"For us to do that, it&#x27;s important that he has appropriate cognitive ability at the time when you&#x27;re on medication, we would argue for his fairness,\" he said at a press conference.\"We need to make sure that he&#x27;s able to understand exactly what&#x27;s happening.\" Investigators will allege officers arrived to find Naveed and his father Sajid Akram, 50, using long arms to fire into crowds of people when they called to Bondi Beach after 6.40pm on Sunday.Several officers exchanged shots with the accused gunmen, and two officers were shot in the process.The alleged nine-minute assault came to an end when Sajid was shot dead, and Naveed was critically shot and hospitalised under police custody. READ MORE: How everyday Aussies can help in the wake of the Bondi shootingA total of 15 people were killed, aged 10 to 87, and 41 more were injured.Police will allege in court that Naveed committed actions that caused death, serious injury and endangered life to advance a religious cause and cause fear in the community.\"Early investigations indicate it was an alleged terrorist attack inspired by ISIS, a listed terrorist organisation in Australia,\" a NSW Police statement reads.Naveed will remain in hospital under police guard until he faces court via a livestream from his bedside later today. Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett earlier said early investigations indicate that no other individual is expected to face charges.\"There is no evidence to suggest other individuals were involved in this attack, however, we caution that this could change given it is early in our investigation,\" she said.If you have been impacted by the terror attack in Bondi there is support available.To contact Lifeline Australia, call 13 11 14 or text 0477 13 11 14.For people under 25 years old, you can contact Kids Helpline at 1800 55 1800.Both of these are available on a 24/7 basis.If you wish to donate blood, you can find your nearest donor centre here.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

This is a time for accountability and action.\"Albanese has faced significant criticism since the attack over the government&#x27;s response to antisemitism, but Frydenberg&#x27;s remarks have escalated the debate.Former prime minister John Howard – who, like Frydenberg, hails from the Liberal Party – has also criticised Albanese but said only the shooters are responsible for their actions.READ MORE: Father identified as 13th Bondi victim \"Clearly the people to blame for the murders are the murderers… (Albanese&#x27;s) greatest failure is not to provide the moral leadership that a prime minister can in denouncing antisemitism,\" he said yesterday.In response to Frydenberg&#x27;s comments, Foreign Minister Penny Wong defended the government&#x27;s response, saying it has denounced antisemitism and took action against rising levels of hate, but conceded more now needs to be done.\"The Jewish Australian community is mourning and so too is the whole of the country,\" she told the ABC. \"This is a time that we need to come together because this attack was inspired by an ideology that is seeking to divide us; a radical, extreme view which seeks to divide our country.\"Frydenberg also said a royal commission into the attack and the rise of antisemitism needed to be called immediately.READ MORE: The five questions Australia is asking after the Bondi terror attack\"We here deserve answers,\" Frydenberg said. \"We don&#x27;t need pious words of comfort, we need answers.\"That was one of eight suggestions to act against antisemitism the former treasurer gave the government.They also included investing in education, and banning \"hate preachers\" and \"extremist organisations\", pointing in particular to Hizb-ut-Tahrir, the radical Islamist organisation that was banned in the United Kingdom last year and in Germany in 2003.He also called for the government to fully implement the recommendations made in July by Jillian Segal, the special envoy to combat antisemitism appointed by Albanese.READ MORE: These are the five questions Australia is asking after the Bondi terror attack The government hasn&#x27;t formally responded to that report – which itself has been criticised, with one human rights expert saying it had \"biased arguments, weak evidence and recommendation overreach\" – but has adopted some of the recommendations.\"We have taken action that she recommended, such as criminalising hate speech, and symbols including the Nazi salute,\" Wong said. \"We&#x27;ve taken action, including my expulsion of the Iranian ambassador, when it was clear that Iran had connections to the attack on a synagogue here in Australia. \"But we all know more needs to be done and we have to work together – our government, all levels of government, faith leaders, community leaders – to eradicate antisemitism, this hatred, from any part of the Australian community.\"READ MORE: Beloved bakery forced to shutter after &#x27;ceaseless antisemitic harassment&#x27; Frydenberg&#x27;s successor, current Treasurer Jim Chalmers, announced an extra $104 million in the federal budget for extra security at Jewish events and crisis support services.He said the government would consider Frydenberg&#x27;s suggestions.\"I have a lot of respect for Josh Frydenberg… I don&#x27;t doubt the intensity or the sincerity of his views,\" Chalmers said. \"And we take them seriously.

Jack was on duty, patrolling the Hanukkah celebration interacting with the community at Bondi Beach, when the incident first occurred.Jack was taken to ICU where he was intubated and underwent multiple surgeries.
