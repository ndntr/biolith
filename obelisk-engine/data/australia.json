          "content": "Self-proclaimed neo-Nazi Thomas Sewell has been arrested outside a Melbourne court hours after he crashed Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan&#x27;s press conference.Sewell was taken into custody out the front of Melbourne Magistrates&#x27; Court, where he was representing himself on a number of charges, including intimidating a police officer, following Sunday&#x27;s anti-immigration march.Exclusive 9News vision shows Sewell being arrested by several police officers about 3.20pm.READ MORE: Police descend on accused gunman Dezi Freeman&#x27;s propertyVictoria Police confirmed that detectives from the Melbourne Crime Investigation Unit attended Melbourne Magistrates Court about 3.20pm and arrested three men.\"Officers arrested a 32-year-old man from Balwyn, a 23-year-old man from Mooroolbark and a 20-year-old man from Ardeer,\" a spokesperson said.\"They are being interviewed in relation to an ongoing investigation into alleged assaults in King&#x27;s Domain about 5pm on 31 August.\"No charges relating to the arrest have been made yet.9News understands today&#x27;s arrest is in relation to an alleged incident on Sunday where white supremacists stormed a First Nations camp.Footage of the alleged incident showed a group neo-Nazis charging towards Camp Sovereignty, a sacred site and standing protest in Kings Domain.Members of the group allegedly attacked the Indigenous group with sticks and flag poles.Witnesses also reported seeing the Indigenous flag being burned, which Deputy Premier Ben Carroll has called \"appalling\".Sewell&#x27;s arrest comes hours after he gatecrashed Allan&#x27;s press conference, where he yelled at the premier over his right to protest.Allan was with Treasurer Jaclyn Symes in North Melbourne when Sewell arrived.\"Why don&#x27;t Australians have the right to protest?\" Sewell could be heard saying.READ MORE: &#x27;Gutless&#x27; attack by neo-Nazis on sacred Indigenous site slammed\"Why do you want to ban us from protesting? Shouldn&#x27;t we have the right to speak in our own country?\" Sewell was held back by security as Allan and Symes quickly left.Sewell was heard telling security, \"You don&#x27;t have the right to put your hands on me\".READ MORE: Fears the country&#x27;s most wanted man is &#x27;getting help&#x27;\"We&#x27;re going to take this country back from politicians like you,\" he said to Allan.Sewell left the scene after Allan, walking away on foot.\"Victoria Police is aware of an incident at a media stand-up in North Melbourne this morning where a man attended and was verbally abusive towards the premier,\" a police spokesperson said.\"The premier&#x27;s security team intervened to ensure the safety of everyone present and the man left shortly after.\"Allan also issued a statement, saying she was \"unharmed and undeterred\".She said it was a \"badge of honour\" to earn the ire of Nazis.\"But this isn&#x27;t about me. It&#x27;s about all the other people in the community who Nazis target - like multicultural people, LGBTIQA+ people, First Peoples, and Jews,\" she said in the written statement.\"They&#x27;re the Victorians who are on my mind right now, and they&#x27;re the Victorians who our anti-hate laws will protect when they come into force later this month.\"The new legislation will strengthen Victoria&#x27;s existing vilification laws, and make it a criminal offence to incite hate or threaten harm based on a protected attribute.\"We know how these goons operate. They whip up fear to divide our society. They will fail,\" Allan said of Sewell.\"Because Victorians are fair, and our values are strong.\"The New Zealand-born white nationalist figure recently made a speech to the crowd at the anti-immigration March For Australia rally in Melbourne on Sunday.In his tirade at the press conference, Sewell also incorrectly claimed 50,000 people attended that rally.On Sunday, he was also seen in a crowd that allegedly attacked an Indigenous encampment, Camp Sovereignty, after splitting off from the main rally.Police are investigating the incident, which Police Minister Andrew Carbines labelled \"gutless\".DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Why do magpies swoop people? Magpies are territorial and swooping is a natural, protective instinct to defend their nest, eggs and chicks from a threat, such as a person.\"Swooping season is all about those birds trying to defend their nest and defend their chicks,\" Edwards said. \"It&#x27;s simply a defensive behaviour where they&#x27;re trying to sort of say, &#x27;back off, don&#x27;t come near me&#x27;.\" Only about 10 per cent of magpies will swoop.Cyclists do tend to get targeted because they are larger and faster than a person on foot and therefore may appear to be a bigger threat.READ MORE: Xi and Putin want to lead the world. They are slowly making it happen How to avoid getting swooped - and injured - by a magpieKeep an eye out for magpies and their nests and try to avoid them.There&#x27;s a national community-sourced website called Magpie Alert where you can check out swooping hotspots in your area and add your own.Your local council may also have information on swooping magpies in your area.According to the Queensland environment department, mapgies will be less likely to swoop if you are in a group or carrying something like an umbrella that you can hold or wave to make you look larger.Cyclists can put cable ties in their helmets and should dismount from their bike and walk to appear less threatening. If you do come across a magpie, try not to run and avoid sudden movements.And try to maintain eye contact , according to NSW National Parks, magpies will be less likely to swoop if they&#x27;re being watched.Wearing a hat and sunglasses can protect your head in the event you are swooped. Do swooping magpies remember you? If you take the same route regularly, some magpies may register that as a recurring threat. \"Magpies do recognise faces and remember faces year after year,\" Edwards said. \"So if you&#x27;ve been swooped in a particular area, unfortunately it&#x27;s likely that you&#x27;ll get swooped again by that same magpie.\" DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "As a select group of world leaders prepares to roll into Beijing for a massive military parade on Wednesday, one is travelling in his signature armoured green train: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.The old-fashioned train has become a symbol of Kim&#x27;s dynasty and his secluded nation. It has also long been the subject of intrigue, carrying generations of the Kim family across the country and on rare international trips.North Korean state media Rodong Sinmun confirmed early Tuesday that Kim&#x27;s train had crossed the border into China, with photos of the leader smiling on board the train, sitting at a wooden table with a North Korean flag behind him. He&#x27;s accompanied by senior officials including Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui, according to the country&#x27;s foreign ministry.READ MORE: Where is Donald Trump today? On the golf course Kim&#x27;s father and predecessor, Kim Jong Il, was reportedly averse to flying and relied heavily on the train, according to Reuters.In one instance in 2002, Russian state media showed images of the train – green with yellow striping – when Kim Jong Il visited Russia during a brief period of relaxed sanctions that allowed greater engagement with the outside world.Both Kim&#x27;s father and grandfather reportedly hosted lavish dinners abroad. One account published in 2002 by Russian official Konstantin Pulikovsky claimed that the train carried cases of Bordeaux and Beaujolais wine from Paris, and that passengers feasted on live lobster and pork barbecue.But that brief period of openness and luxury ended quickly, with international sanctions clamping back down in 2003. Though very little information from the isolated nation reaches the outside world now, reports indicate severe impoverishment and malnourishment throughout much of the country.The train is also famously slow-moving and tight on security. It&#x27;s so heavily armoured that it travels at an average speed of 60 kilometres an hour, according to a 2009 report in South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo.READ MORE: Melbourne man&#x27;s passport search unearths $1 million winning lotto ticketIt contained conference rooms, an audience chamber and bedrooms and featured satellite phone connections and flat screen televisions, the paper reported at the time. In Kim Jong Il&#x27;s time, some 20 stations were built for the family train, the paper said.Kim has used this train on several trips abroad, though he has also previously travelled by plane and private jet.Kim rode the train during his last international visit – a 2023 trip to Russia&#x27;s far east to meet with his counterpart Vladimir Putin. Photos released by state media at the time offered a glimpse into the locomotive, showing polished wooden floors and an ornately decorated white doorway.State media footage released in 2022 showed Kim working in his office on board the train, and also relaxing on board while smoking a cigarette in a short-sleeved shirt, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap.And during a 2018 trip when Kim met Chinese leader Xi Jinping, footage by North Korean state media showed Chinese officials boarding the train to greet Kim. The delegations held talks on board, sitting on two rows of pink couches, photos showed.Besides international travel, the train has also been featured in state propaganda, with the Kim family going on long train journeys to meet ordinary North Koreans, Reuters reported.A life-sized model of one of the train&#x27;s carriages is displayed in a mausoleum outside the North Korean capital Pyongyang, where the remains of Kim&#x27;s father and grandfather are kept.READ MORE: Xi and Modi talk friendship in a &#x27;chaotic&#x27; world as Trump&#x27;s tariffs biteDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
