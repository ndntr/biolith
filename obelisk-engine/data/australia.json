          "content": "Ukraine’s Western allies rallied around the war-torn country on Saturday as they pushed to revise a United States peace plan seen as favouring Moscow despite its all-out invasion of its neighbour.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has vowed Ukrainians “will always defend” their home.A Ukrainian delegation, bolstered by representatives from France, Germany and the UK, is preparing for direct talks with Washington in Switzerland on Sunday (Geneva time).LIVE UPDATES: Cyclone Fina could reach category 4 as storm batters DarwinThe 28-point blueprint drawn up by the US to end the nearly four-year war sparked alarm in Kyiv and European capitals, with Zelenskyy saying his country could face a stark choice between standing up for its sovereign rights and preserving the American support it needs.Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Saturday, President Donald Trump said the US proposal was not his “final offer.”“I would like to get to peace. It should have happened a long time ago. The Ukraine war with Russia should have never happened,” Trump said.“One way or the other, we have to get it ended.”The US plan foresees Ukraine handing over territory to Russia, something Kyiv has repeatedly ruled out, while reducing the size of its army and blocking its coveted path to NATO membership. It contains many of Moscow’s long-standing demands, while offering limited security guarantees to Kyiv.READ MORE: Fantasy author Darryl King isn&#x27;t too concerned about AI. Writers who use a pen name may need to worryOn Saturday, leaders of the European Union, Canada and Japan issued a joint statement welcoming US peace efforts, but pushed back against key tenets of the plan.“We are ready to engage in order to ensure that a future peace is sustainable. We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force. We are also concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine’s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack,” the statement said.It added that any decisions regarding NATO and the EU would require the consent of member states.READ MORE: Show goes on after comedian dies on stageThe leaders of France, Germany and the UK met during the day on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, to discuss ways to support Kyiv, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told reporters at the summit that “wars cannot be ended by major powers over the heads of the countries affected,” and insisted Kyiv needed robust guarantees.French President Emmanuel Macron said the US peace plan for Ukraine “requires broader consultation” because “it stipulates many things involving Europeans,” like Russia&#x27;s frozen assets and Ukraine’s accession to the European Union. Europe&#x27;s security issues must also be taken into account, Macron said, adding: “We want a robust and lasting peace.\"Merz and Macron said that envoys from Germany, France, the UK and the EU will join Ukrainian negotiators as they meet a US delegation in Geneva on Sunday to discuss Washington’s proposal.Zelenskyy confirmed the meeting on Saturday, after Trump set a deadline for Kyiv to respond to the plan by next Thursday.Among those expected to represent Washington are Trump’s Army secretary, Dan Driscoll, and Marco Rubio, who serves as both national security adviser and secretary of state, according to a US official who was not authorised to publicly discuss the American participants before the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity.Driscoll presented the US plan to Ukrainian officials this week.European leaders have long warned against rushing a peace deal, seeing their own future at stake in Ukraine’s fight to beat back Russia, and insist on being consulted in peace efforts.‘Quite a way from a good outcome’Kyiv&#x27;s key allies in Europe reiterated their reservations about the Kremlin&#x27;s readiness to end the war.“Time and again, Russia pretends to be serious about peace, but their actions never live up to their words,” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters ahead of the G20 summit, days after a Russian strike on western Ukraine killed over two dozen civilians.European leaders have long accused Russia of stalling diplomatic efforts in the hope of overwhelming Ukraine&#x27;s much smaller forces on the battlefield.Kyiv has repeatedly accepted US ceasefire proposals this year, while Moscow has held out for more favourable terms.READ MORE: Brazil&#x27;s judge orders Bolsonaro&#x27;s arrest for allegedly plotting escape ahead of prison term“An end to the war can only be achieved with the unconditional consent of Ukraine,” Merz said during G20 summit briefing, adding that he had told Trump in a long phone call on Friday that Europe needed to be a part of any peace process, and that Russia had previously failed to keep its promises to respect Ukraine&#x27;s territorial integrity.\"From my perspective, there is currently a chance to end this war,” Merz added. “But we are still quite a way from a good outcome for everyone.”EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that a key principle for Kyiv&#x27;s European allies was “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.”Zelenskyy defiant as Ukraine remembers Soviet-era famineZelenskyy, in a video address published on Saturday, said Ukrainian representatives at the Geneva talks “know how to protect Ukrainian national interests and exactly what is needed to prevent Russia from carrying out” another invasion. “Real peace is always based on security and justice,” he added.Nine officials are to take part in the talks, including Zelenskyy’s chief of staff Andrii Yermak and top envoy Rustem Umerov, according to a statement posted on the Ukrainian presidency’s website, which also stated that the negotiators are empowered to deal directly with Russia.READ MORE: The world&#x27;s biggest company just told everyone to chill outOn Saturday, Ukraine commemorated the “great famine” that Soviet leader Josef Stalin imposed in the early 1930s, which led to millions of deaths.“We all know how and why millions of our people died, starved to death, and millions were never born. And we are once again defending ourselves against Russia, which has not changed and is once again bringing death,” Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram marking Holodomor Memorial Day.“We defended, defend, and will always defend Ukraine. Because only here is our home. And in our home, Russia will definitely not be the master,” he added.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
