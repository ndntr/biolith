It is a shame!\" Thunberg told journalists and protesters shortly upon arriving.\"I could talk for a very, very long time about our mistreatment and abuses in our imprisonment, trust me, but that is not the story.\"Instead, Thunberg urged world leaders and ordinary citizens around the world to end their \"complicity\" with the \"genocide\" being carried out against Palestinians in Gaza.\"This action was challenging our extremely violent business as usual,\" Thunberg said. \"We cannot take our eyes away from Gaza.\"Israel&#x27;s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza&#x27;s Health Ministry, since the October 7 attacks exactly two years ago.

It is also enormously useful, as quantum mechanics is the foundation of all digital technology,\" said Olle Eriksson, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics.The 100-year-old field of quantum mechanics deals with the seemingly impossible subatomic world where switches can be on and off at the same time and parts of atoms tunnel through what seems like impenetrable barriers.

Last year, artificial intelligence pioneers John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton won the physics prize for helping create the building blocks of machine learning.On Monday, Mary E Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine for discoveries about how the immune system knows to attack germs and not our bodies.Nobel announcements continue with the chemistry prize on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics on October 13.The award ceremony will be held December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite who founded the prizes.The prizes carry priceless prestige and a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1.7 million).",
