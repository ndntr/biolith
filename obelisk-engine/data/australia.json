No further detail about the tennis ball bomb was provided.Police also claimed a box-like bomb was found in the boot of the car while two hand-painted Islamic State flags were also found in the car.Further weaponry and explosive devices were discovered by police in the Campsie rental, including a 3D-printed shotgun speed loader, a firearm scope, two more guns and another suspected bomb.Police allege the men left behind videos that indicated their adherence to religiously motivated violent extremism.Footage recorded in late October - six to eight weeks before the attack - and shown in the fact sheet showed each Akram training with long-arm guns and \"moving in a tactical manner\" in a countryside location.Police suspect the area was in NSW.\"The (younger Akram) is recorded appearing to recite, in Arabic, a passage from the Quran,\" the facts sheet states.\"Following the recitation, both the accused and S.AKRAM speak in English and make a number of statements regarding their motivation for the &#x27;Bondi attack&#x27; and condemning the acts of &#x27;Zionists&#x27;.(sic)\"Further footage captured by security cameras at Bondi Beach appears to show the Akrams scoped out the area about 48 hours before their attack.\"There is evidence that the accused and his father ... meticulously planned this terrorist attack for many months,\" the facts sheet says.READ MORE: NSW gun laws to be &#x27;toughest in country&#x27; As well as releasing the police allegations, Deputy Chief Magistrate Michael Antrum today suppressed the identities of 25 survivors, to protect their privacy and assist their recovery.The court order allows victim-survivors to choose if and when they go public with their story, and join other survivors such as Arsen Ostrovsky and hero tobacconist Ahmed Al Ahmed.Akram remains in custody and was today transferred from hospital to a NSW prison under police guard.His case is next due in court in April.",
