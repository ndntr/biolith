          "content": "The Liberal Party has been savaged for abandoning its net zero target, with former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull accusing the MPs who drove the change of having the memory of goldfish.Speaking to ABC radio this morning, Turnbull said Opposition Leader Sussan Ley&#x27;s decision would have disastrous political consequences.\"It&#x27;s Groundhog Day,\" he said.READ MORE: Australia now has a new leading cause of death \"They&#x27;re sending a message to most Australians, they do not take climate change seriously.\"What the Liberal Party is doing is essentially flying in the face of reality, not just the reality of the physics of global warming, but the reality of economics…\"If you want to fight to the death over who&#x27;s going to have the 15 per cent or 10 per cent (of the vote) that people of Pauline Hanson&#x27;s persuasion might be disposed to, knock yourself out, but that is no way ever to get back into government.\"Climate policy has long been a sticking point in the Liberal party room, with Turnbull himself dumped as opposition leader back in 2009 after supporting the Rudd government&#x27;s emissions trading scheme.The party has hemorrhaged seats in capital cities – particularly in inner-metropolitan areas – to teal independents, Labor and the Greens in the past two elections, much of which has been attributed to comparatively weak climate policies.READ MORE: Who else has been name-checked in the Epstein email trove? Turnbull said he had sympathy for Ley, a moderate who confirmed the switch to abandon net zero after a majority of Liberal MPs, driven by the conservatives, spoke out against the policy.\"Unfortunately she&#x27;s caught in this terrible fishbowl, if you like, with the Liberal party room,\" he said.\"They&#x27;ve got the memory of goldfish and the dining habits of piranhas.\"They seem to just keep on forgetting and making the same mistake again and again… \"It is leading them into this spiral which has resulted in them losing almost all of their city seats, losing almost all of their safest seats, the lowest vote they&#x27;ve ever had. \"Now they want to double down and do it again.\"READ MORE: Molly Ticehurst&#x27;s ex-boyfriend pleads guilty to her murder The government, as well as the teal independents and Greens, have also been quick to condemn the Liberals&#x27; decision.But the criticism hasn&#x27;t just come from politicians, with scientists lamenting the move as a step backwards.\"(It&#x27;s) a catastrophic failure to acknowledge both climate science and energy system dynamics… this intentional policy failure immediately exposes Australia to the severe physical risks detailed in the National Climate Risk Assessment,\" Associate Professor James Hopeward from the University of South Australia said. \"Under the highest warming scenarios (3.0°C) considered in the NCRA, severe heatwave events could more than quadruple, dramatically increasing heat-related mortality.\"Ley said the Liberals would prioritise cheap energy over emissions reductions through a \"technology agnostic\" approach – including potentially funding more coal power, even though scientists, including those at the CSIRO, have repeatedly pointed to renewables as the cheapest form of energy.READ MORE: &#x27;Blob&#x27; of ocean could build to tropical cyclone as early as next week \"The decision… doesn&#x27;t pass the pub test,\" ANU energy expert Ken Baldwin said.\"It ignores… the economics which say that it is vastly cheaper to address climate change than to do nothing, and the business case for replacing our aging fleet of coal-fired power stations by using renewables as the cheapest option to keep electricity prices down.\"Ley also said the party remained committed to the Paris Agreement – even though removing the net zero target would be in breach of the treaty – and reaching net zero would be a \"welcome outcome\".\"They will not happen by accident, something to &#x27;welcome&#x27; if we stumble across it,\" Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change vice-chair Mark Howden said. \"Additionally, the Paris Agreement has a &#x27;ratchet&#x27; clause which requires nations to successively increase their emission-reduction goals, so suggestions of stepping back our goals are incompatible with that agreement.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

So it&#x27;s probably be a bit of time before we would see auroras again,\" she said.Allen said people further south of mid Australia and on the east coast may have a better chance of witnessing the auroras .The Bureau of Meteorology&#x27;s Space Weather Forecasting Centre is less confident and believes the chances of seeing the aurora are small to unlikely.\"We think we&#x27;ve passed the peak of the geomagnetic activity now, and it&#x27;s a weakening trend, but certainly it&#x27;s something that we&#x27;re monitoring constantly,\" Reeves said. Auroras do not need to be overhead to be viewed and can be seen as far as 1000km away if it is bright and the conditions are right.They are best seen at places with a clear view of the horizon, like a beach or bay. READ MORE: Woman&#x27;s fear she won&#x27;t be buried with husband over vegetation rulesTonight&#x27;s spectacle is caused by a severe geomagnetic storm that is impacting the Earth.The storm was sparked by three coronal mass ejections, also known as solar flares, which sent out particles that interacted with Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.Allen says that interaction with Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is what creates the \"beautiful curtains of light\". \"The last bit of that energy, energetic coronal mass ejection, has already reached Earth, so unless there&#x27;s another significant event that happens today, we wouldn&#x27;t expect there to be any more peak activity for a while,\" she said. The sun is currently at its most active part of the 11-year solar cycle and is peaking.\"So that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re seeing so much aurora activity,\" Allen said.Allen said there have been more reports of aurora activity than ever before, which has set a \"new tone for what we expect\" in the coming years.\"We haven&#x27;t seen anything like this before,\" she said. \"What&#x27;s to say during the next solar cycle that there couldn&#x27;t even be more of these flares?\" DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
