          "content": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been met with boos from parts of a crowd gathered last night at Bondi Beach as they marked exactly one week after Australia&#x27;s worst terror attack.Albanese has faced criticism since the massacre over claims his government failed to protect the Jewish community, for not attending funerals for all of the victims, and for not going far enough in the government&#x27;s response.Last night, wearing a kippah in a sign of respect at the sombre ceremony, Albanese encountered some of that displeasure in person.READ MORE: PM orders review into law enforcement and intelligence agencies As NSW Jewish Board of Deputies president David Ossip announced the dignitaries who were in attendance, there were loud boos for Albanese from some amongst the crowd of many thousands.Ossip calmed the noise from the disgruntled.For NSW Premier Chris Minns there was a standing ovation as Ossip highlighted that he had not missed a single funeral for the victims.There was also similar applause for NSW Opposition Leader Kellie Sloane, who Ossip said had gone to Bondi Beach on the night of the attacks to help victims.\"That is bravery, that is courage,\" he said.READ MORE: Emotional moment as thousands gather at Bondi Beach Ossip said more needed to be done, and there was loud cheering as he said \"it cannot be disputed that we need a royal commission, which goes beyond NSW, to get to the bottom of how this catastrophe took place\".\"We feared and suspected that this moment was coming.\"Albanese has announced a review will be conducted into the country&#x27;s intelligence and federal law enforcement agencies in the wake of the Bondi shooting, but has stopped short of ordering a royal commission.The report will be led by former intelligence chief Dennis Richardson, and will examine multiple aspects of how Australia&#x27;s security agencies are equipped to respond to acts of terror.Nationals leader David Littleproud today said there was \"no reason why we shouldn&#x27;t have a federal royal commission\" and claimed Albanese was afraid of the \"truth\" being revealed.\"There has been a litany of failures here for two and a half years. The warning signs were there from the 8th of October, 2023.READ MORE: Hundreds join &#x27;Australia first&#x27; rally despite calls to stop \"We should look ourselves in the eye.

With humility I acknowledge the government and its highest duty is to protect the citizens and we did not do that one week ago.\"That reality weighs on me heavily.\"We must accept that responsibility and use that to do everything and anything we possibly can to stop it from happening again.\"Minns said the massacre was an attempt \"to marginalise and scatter, to intimidate and cause fear\".\"But you have stood up to this intimidation for thousands of years. Tonight, thanks to the Jewish community of Australia on this last night of Chanukah, you have reclaimed Bondi Beach for us.\"Though the attack targeted Jewish people, Minns said the pain was felt by all Australians.\"The sad truth is this crime has tragically highlighted a deep vein of antisemitic hate in our community. To excuse it as an aberration or a tragic single event is wrong.\"As the late chief rabbi once said, the Jewish cannot fight antisemitism alone, the victim cannot fight the crime, the hated cannot cure the hate. We cannot let the Jewish people carry this burden by themselves, it is Australia&#x27;s responsibility.\"",

But then he politely told her to start again.Because the NSW opposition leader was not merely a political figure addressing the thousands still mourning – she was one of the heroes trying to save lives even as the gunmen were still firing.READ MORE: Bondi Beach &#x27;reclaimed&#x27; in powerful vigil one week after attackShe was under the bridge where the shots were being fired from, and what she saw \"will haunt me forever\".\"I stand before you as someone who saw the devastation, who arrived here last week while the shots were still being fired, who witnessed the chaos and the distress and who saw the injured and who held the hands of those who needed their hands held,\" she told the vigil last night.Earlier on December 14, Sloane had been celebrating the first day of Hanukkah nearby at Dover Heights.People were laughing and there was dancing.Sloane had been on stage ready to address the crowd, tragically about the hope she had after a horror start to the year.But she didn&#x27;t get to those words. She saw a crowd start to run, disperse and security guards locking down the event.READ MORE: Albanese booed, Minns praised at Bondi Beach vigil Rabbi Mendy Litzman was there with his ambulance and Sloane jumped in.\"I don&#x27;t know that he needed an extra passenger but he was on the phone to his colleague … who had been shot and he was in a bad state.\"They raced to Bondi and arrived within minutes, parking under the bridge while the gunmen were still on top.Litzman grabbed his kit and raced to the scene and began \"making impossible choices about who to deal with first and who to treat\".\"I helped a man and his 10-year-old boy who were hiding under that bridge get into our ambulance because I thought they&#x27;d be safer there,\" Sloane said.\"And then I walked into the scene.\"What I saw will haunt me forever.\"But I saw police running into this scene fast and unhesitatingly, with guns drawn, headed into danger.READ MORE: Hundreds join &#x27;Australia first&#x27; rally despite calls to stop \"And I heard … the final pop, pop, pop of gunfire\", as the shooters were finally stopped.\"I tried my best to help, a surf lifesaver told me, &#x27;grab bandages&#x27;. I said, &#x27;what do I do?&#x27; And he said, \"plug the holes&#x27;.\"Sloane sat next to the injured and dying, \"holding their hands, putting blankets over people who we couldn&#x27;t help anymore\".\"I had people fall into my arms who were grief stricken because they felt that they hadn&#x27;t done enough, and we all felt that way.\"But, man, I saw them as heroes, and they were heroes.\"And there was nothing more any of us could do.\"The crowd warmly embraced Sloane as she recounted her horrors, celebrating the heroics of others as she pointed them out.The member for Vaucluse said the first draft of her speech omitted what she herself saw on December 14 \"because my experience felt absolutely insignificant compared to that of so many others who are sitting here tonight\".And it felt raw, she said.Rabbi Eli Feldman convinced her to make changes.READ MORE: PM orders review into law enforcement and intelligence agencies \"He said the words I had were appropriate and they were beautiful but that I had a bigger story to tell, that I have shared something with this community that must be retold.\"[He] said to me that bearing witness and recounting that story might be hard and it might be confronting … but it is important, and he is right.\"&#x27;Antisemitism has led to blood spilling on our most iconic beach&#x27;Sloane said the attack came after a year in which Jewish people in Australia had been \"abused\".The year started with \"our community facing consistent firebombings, almost day after day, and vandalism,\" she said.\"Helicopters flying over our houses at night, while we slept, to keep our Jewish neighbours safe.\"A year where the Jewish community had been doxed, they&#x27;d been abused, they&#x27;d been unable to attend university.\"They&#x27;d been abandoned by old friends and colleagues in the most heartbreaking way.\"Jewish people had been accused of overreacting, she said.\"Very few … paid attention when community leaders warned that history … history tells us that hate speech makes violence possible.\"How could anyone who is a student of history deny that broken windows lead to violence?\"Well, let there be no doubt now. Antisemitism has now led to the spilling of blood on our nation&#x27;s most iconic beach.\"Sloane plans to read the names of the victims in NSW parliament as she reckons with \"what do we do now?\"\"How do we comprehend what has happened to our country?\"She said she clings to the outpouring of love in the wake of the attacks.\"It&#x27;s given me hope that we will mend together.\"I am in pieces with you but I will be strong like you are strong, and you inspire me. And together … we will find the light together.\"",
