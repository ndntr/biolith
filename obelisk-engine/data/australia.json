Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito are the other dissenters who are on the court today.Roberts has been silent on the subject since he wrote a dissenting opinion in the case. Alito has continued to criticise the decision, but he said recently he was not advocating that it be overturned.READ MORE: Trump pardons Rudy Giuliani, others involved in efforts to overturn 2020 election Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was not on the court in 2015, has said that there are times when the court should correct mistakes and overturn decisions, as it did in the 2022 case that ended a constitutional right to abortion.But Barrett has suggested recently that same-sex marriage might be in a different category than abortion because people have relied on the decision when they married and had children.Human Rights Campaign president Kelley Robinson praised the justices&#x27; decision not to intervene.READ MORE: Scientists dismiss &#x27;poor&#x27; claims about paracetamol&#x27;s links to autism \"The Supreme Court made clear today that refusing to respect the constitutional rights of others does not come without consequences,\" Robinson said in a statement.Davis drew national attention to eastern Kentucky&#x27;s Rowan County when she turned away same-sex couples, saying her faith prevented her from complying with the high court ruling.She defied court orders to issue the licenses until a federal judge jailed her for contempt of court in September 2015.She was released after her staff issued the licenses on her behalf but removed her name from the form. The Kentucky legislature later enacted a law removing the names of all county clerks from state marriage licenses.Davis lost a re-election bid in 2018.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

My energy is focused solely on the single goal of proving my innocence,\" Sarkozy said.Earlier on Monday, before his release, Sarkozy addressed a court hearing via videolink, he said that his 20 days in prison had been, \"very hard.\"He paid tribute to prison staff during his hearing, adding that they had, \"an exceptional humanity which made this nightmare bearable.\"According to French magazine Le Point, Sarkozy had refused to eat anything except yoghurts during his nearly three-week stint behind bars, reportedly due to fear other prisoners might spit in his food.READ MORE: Man arrested after minivan chase in MelbourneProsecutors requested Sarkozy be released under judicial control, with restrictions on whom he can contact.The court ruled that the former head of state will be forbidden from leaving France.The court also specified that Sarkozy is forbidden from contacting people implicated in his case as well as the current French Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin, who came under public scrutiny for visiting Sarkozy in prison in October, according to BFMTV.In a statement posted to X shortly before Sarkozy set off for prison on October 21, Sarkozy stressed that he was an \"innocent man.\" Upon his conviction, he railed against the decision to find him guilty.\"If they absolutely want me to sleep in prison, I will sleep in prison. But with my head held high,\" he told journalists after his sentencing hearing, his voice boiling with anger.READ MORE: Charges three months after &#x27;amazing&#x27; man killed in alleged hit-runHe released a list of three books he took into prison, including two volumes of \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" and a biography of Jesus Christ.The former president, who left office in 2012, had been expected to occupy a cell either in solitary confinement or in the so-called \"VIP wing\" of La Santé prison complex while awaiting his appeal on the conviction.That wing is usually reserved for prisoners who are considered unsuitable to be kept among the prison&#x27;s general population, usually out of fears for their safety.They could be politicians, former police officers, members of far-right organizations or those tied to Islamist terror groups, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported.Cells in the wing are fitted with a metal bed and mattress, a small desk, a fridge, a cooking hob, a television, a shower, toilet and sink, and a fixed telephone line allowing prisoners to call certain authorised numbers.Previous inmates include Manuel Noriega, the former dictator of Panama who was held there following his extradition from the United States after the American invasion that deposed him.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
