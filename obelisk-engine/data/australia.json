          "content": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has split Labor&#x27;s proposed package of hate and gun laws after the Greens announced they would join the Coalition in opposing the legislation.Labor will instead introduce separate bills on gun laws and hate crimes and migration on Tuesday but will not proceed with proposed racial vilification legislation.Greens leader Larissa Waters confirmed her party would not support the bill, which proposed a range of reforms in the wake of the Bondi Beach terror attack.READ MORE: NSW beaches hit with huge waves as rough conditions intensify READ MORE: &#x27;Factories of hate&#x27;: NSW cracks down on illegal prayer hallsThe original proposal combined a landmark gun buyback scheme, increased penalties for hate crimes, new offence for hate preachers radicalising children and inciting hatred to intimidate and harass.They also include an expanded ban on prohibited symbols and increased powers for the Home Affairs department to cancel or refuse visas for people who spread hatred.During a snap press conference this afternoon, the Prime Minister said the government would only proceed with measures that had the support of the parliament.\"The Greens party have engaged in good faith, and I thank them for that, and I had a discussion with Larissa Waters yesterday and she informed me about where they had landed,\" Albanese said.\"She informed me she would vote for the gun laws but would not vote for other parts of the legislation.\"In order to ensure passage of these gun laws, we will be separating out schedule three and four of the bill.\"That is important to deal with customs updates but also to have the national gun buyback scheme along the model that was implemented after the Port Arthur massacre under John Howard.\"We will separate out the bills, the gun laws will be separate and the laws on hate crimes and migration will proceed, but we will not be proceeding with the racial vilification provisions because it&#x27;s clear that that will not have support.\"We will only proceed with measures that have the support of the parliament and are likely to receive that.\"READ MORE: Almost 5 million Aussie social media accounts wiped in a single week READ MORE: Neo-Nazi group to be &#x27;fully disbanded&#x27; before hate speech laws Waters said in a statement this morning the party would work with the government to pass gun laws but Greens members believed the rest of the bill needed work.\"With every hour that passes, more concerns are raised by legal experts, faith groups and the community about the omnibus bill,\" Waters said.\"This is complex legislation, with a lot of massive pitfalls and omissions, and the process to fix it can&#x27;t be rushed.\" Waters argued the federal government should \"start fresh with a bill that aims to protect everyone from hatred and discrimination\".\"We are willing to sit down with the government to find a way forward, but it&#x27;s clear that the amount of negotiations and legal analysis required to produce a good outcome can&#x27;t be done in the extremely tight timeframe the government has created,\" she said.\"We need to keep all people in the community safe from discrimination and hatred, and good laws don&#x27;t come from rushed work.\"READ MORE: Shoppers warned after &#x27;ghost&#x27; store attempts to profit from Bondi terror attack READ MORE: Bondi hero reveals &#x27;trauma&#x27; after seeing video of confrontation with gunman The Greens have argued the laws should protect everyone from hatred and discrimination, including women, members of the LGBTQ+ community and those living with disabilities.Members of the party have also said the laws should not be used to shut down legitimate political protests.The minor party joined the Coalition in expressing opposition towards the reforms after Opposition Leader Sussan Ley described the proposed bill as \"unsalvageable\" earlier this week.\"The opposition will continue to scrutinise this legislation carefully, but from what we have seen so far, it looks pretty unsalvageable,\" Ley said.\"As it stands, the government&#x27;s proposal is half-baked, and Australians deserve far better.\"Ley claimed the proposed changes do not address the root issue of the Bondi attack.\"We have got this bundle of measures heading in many different directions, criticised in a very valid way by a whole range of people, but not actually addressing the issue,\" she said.\"Parliament should have been reconvened before Christmas to actually demonstrate leadership, compassion and the determination that I have spoken of every day since to tackle radical Islamic extremism and eradicate antisemitism.\" DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Trump has previously been dismissive about the idea of Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize coveted by the US president in 2025, leading Venezuela in the wake of US forces kidnapping Maduro to stand trial in New York.Prior to their meeting, he said she did not have the respect or support inside the country to do so, despite the broad international assessment of her electoral success.Since Machado left the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt, while hailing her as \"a remarkable and brave voice\" , said Trump&#x27;s opinion had not changed.READ MORE: Execution of Iranian protester Erfan Soltani postponed, family says It was, Leavitt said, \"a realistic assessment\".Trump has also signalled a willingness to engage with interim president Delcy Rodriguez, a Maduro loyalist and his former vice president.The pair have talked on the phone, with Trump characterising it as a \"great conversation\" on a wide range of topics.Rodriguez, for her part, has varied her tone on the US and Trump.Originally condemning the kidnapping of Maduro and demanding his return, she has since said she is open to diplomacy with the US and may even be willing to open up Venezuela&#x27;s nationalised oil industry to foreign investment. The US, meanwhile, has continued targeting Venezuelan oil tankers, seizing a sixth one this morning.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
