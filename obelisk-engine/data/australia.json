Iran retaliated with a salvo of missiles.Airlines cancelled almost 40 per cent of flights to Israel and 6.7 per cent of flights to the broader region on Saturday, according to preliminary Cirium data.The United Arab Emirates (UAE), home to both the long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad, closed their airspace on Saturday.The flow on effects are already being felt at Australian airports with the 6am and 6.15am Emirates flights out of Sydney and Melbourne both cancelled .\"We apologise to customers affected by disruptions for any inconvenience caused, and we are assisting them with rebooking, refunds, or alternative travel arrangements,\" Emirates said in a statement to passengers.\"The safety and security of our passengers and crew remain our highest priority.\"An early morning Etihad flight out of Brisbane was similarly cut but the evening departure is \"estimated\" to go ahead as planned. Similarly, evening flights out of Perth and Sydney for Sunday are currently showing as \"on time\" .While the closure of Abu Dhabi&#x27;s airspace forced the cancellation of Etihad flights on Saturday, currently Sunday afternoon&#x27;s departure out of Sydney Airport is showing as \"on time\".\"All departures from Abu Dhabi are suspended until 14.00 (9pm AEDT) Sunday 1 March,\" the airline said in a statement.\"Arrivals before 14.00 Sunday 1 March are cancelled. Services after this time are expected to operate, subject to conditions.\"Qatar Airways said it had temporarily cancelled flights to and from Doha because Qatari airspace was closed, estimating normal flights would resume around midnight (8am AEDT).As a result the Saturday night flight out of Perth was cancelled but Sunday&#x27;s 10.45pm departure remains on the board.So far, the Qatar flights to Doha out of Melbourne in the afternoon, as well as out of Sydney and Brisbane in the evening, are all still on the board as scheduled as well.The airline warns customers to expect delays once business resumes.\"Once operations resume, passengers should expect delays, and are advised to check the latest flight information,\" they said in a statement .Virgin Australia&#x27;s listed flight to Doha on Sunday, VA1, is showing as \"diverted\" on the Sydney Airport schedule and VA21 out of Perth in the afternoon is showing as \"cancelled\".Flow on effects all over the globe Dutch airline KLM had already announced earlier in the week that it was suspending flights to and from Tel Aviv starting Sunday.Airlines including Lufthansa, Air France, Transavia, Qatar Airways, and Pegasus have cancelled all flights to Lebanon.Virgin Atlantic cancelled its flight from Heathrow Airport in London to Dubai and said it would avoid flying over Iraq, meaning flights to and from India, the Maldives and Riyadh could take slightly longer.The airline already was not flying over Iran. Virgin Atlantic said all flights would carry appropriate fuel in case they need to reroute on short notice.British Airways said flights to Tel Aviv and Bahrain will be suspended until next week, and flights to Amman, Jordan, will be cancelled Saturday.United Airlines said flights en-route to Tel Aviv and Dubai on Saturday morning were either diverted or returned to the US.The airline cancelled flights between the US and Tel Aviv through Monday and flights between the US and Dubai through Sunday. It issued a travel waiver so passengers can change their flights at no cost.Turkish Airlines said on X that flights to Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Jordan will be suspended until Monday and flights to Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Oman would be suspended on Saturday.The airline said additional cancellations may be announced and Kuwait Airways temporarily suspended flights.Kuwait&#x27;s aviation authority said it was halting all flights to Iran until further notice, according to the state news agency, while Oman Air said it had suspended all flights to Baghdad due to the regional developments.The European Union&#x27;s aviation regulator EASA on Saturday recommended its airlines stay out of the airspace affected by the on-going military intervention.The Russian Ministry of Transport said on Saturday that Russian air carriers had suspended flights to Iran and Israel.Germany&#x27;s Lufthansa LHAG.DE said it was suspending flights to and from Dubai on Saturday and Sunday and halting temporarily the Tel Aviv, Beirut and Oman routes until March 7. Air France cancelled flights to and from Tel Aviv and Beirut.Iberia also cancelled flights to Tel Aviv, while Wizz Air WIZZ.L suspended flights to and from Israel, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Amman with immediate effect until the same date, it said.Passengers and airlines can expect airspace to be shut for some time in the region. It&#x27;s also important to look at the tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan as that will limit airspace even further, said Eric Schouten, head of aviation security advisory Dyami.\"With hostilities now underway, the impact on regional aviation is immediate and highly fluid,\" he said.\"We also anticipate precautionary evacuations or temporary shutdowns at select Gulf airports if the threat envelope expands, which would immediately disrupt key transit hubs,\" he noted.Various Indian airlines, including Air India, also suspended flights to the Middle East.- Reported with Reuters , Associated Press and CNN.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

          "content": "The US and Israel launched a major attack on Iran on Saturday, and US President Donald Trump urged the Iranian public to \"seize control of your destiny\" by rising up against the Islamic leadership that has ruled the nation since 1979.Iran retaliated by firing missiles and drones toward Israel and US military bases in the region, and exchanges of fire continued into the evening.Some of the first strikes on Iran appeared to destroy the compound of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later suggested had been killed.LIVE UPDATES: US launches &#x27;major combat operations in Iran&#x27; The death toll in Iran has grown to 201 people and another 747 injured across 24 provinces, according to the Iranian Red Crescent. Among those killed are 85 people who died following a strike on a girls&#x27; school in southern Iran, according to state news agency IRNA. CNN called Iran&#x27;s retaliatory attacks \"unprecedented\", disrupting air travel in the region and oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz for many hours after the initial strikes. Israel&#x27;s military said \"dozens\" of missiles had been fired at it by Iran and the barrages continued even after sundown. CNN quoted a source with knowledge of Iran&#x27;s military strategy saying it&#x27;s ready for \"a long war\" and will continue its offence \"until the aggressor is punished\". \"No significant damage has been done to Iran&#x27;s missile and defense capabilities, and Iran has prepared itself for a long war,\" the source added. Strikes targeted supreme leader, but were also widespread Smoke rose from the Iranian capital on Saturday although the strikes occurred nationwide. It wasn&#x27;t immediately clear whether the 86-year-old leader was in his offices when the attack occurred.Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi earlier told NBC News that Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian are alive \"as far as I know,\" and called the attack \"unprovoked, illegal and absolutely illegitimate\".In a video announcing the \"major combat operations,\" Trump told Iranians that \"when we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed that goal, called for \"the brave Iranian people to take their fate into their own hands.\"The strikes during the holy fasting month of Ramadan opened a stunning new chapter in US intervention in Iran, and marked the second time in eight months that the Trump administration has attacked the Islamic Republic during talks over its nuclear program.Weeks earlier, a US military operation captured Venezuela&#x27;s president, Nicolás Maduro.The targets included members of Iran&#x27;s leadership, according to a US official and another person briefed on the attacks who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an on-going operation. There was no immediate information on whether top officials were killed.The US president reached his decision after weeks of deliberation and an attempt by his envoys to strike a rapid diplomatic agreement that would have forced Iran to abandon long-held red lines.The US military is planning for several days of attacks, two sources told CNN.Even if Iran&#x27;s top leaders are killed, regime change is not guaranteed. Neither the US nor Israel have articulated a vision for what new leadership might look like.Democrats decried that Trump had taken action without congressional authorisation. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration had briefed several Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress in advance of the attack.The UN Security Council said it would meet on Saturday afternoon (8am Sunday AEDT).In a letter to the council, Araghchi said \"all bases, facilities, and assets of the hostile forces in the region shall be regarded as legitimate military objectives.\"Iran also requested an urgent session of the International Atomic Energy Agency&#x27;s Board of Governors about \"these threats to safeguarded nuclear facilities,\" according to a letter posted by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.The UN&#x27;s nuclear watchdog said on X it was closely monitoring developments and had seen \"no evidence of radiological impact\".Rising tensionsTensions have soared in recent weeks as American warships moved into the region.Trump said he wanted a deal to constrain Iran&#x27;s nuclear program at a moment when the country is struggling at home with growing dissent following nationwide protests.The immediate trigger for Saturday&#x27;s strikes appeared to be the unsuccessful latest round of nuclear talks.But they also reflected dramatic changes that have left Iran&#x27;s leadership in its weakest position since the Islamic Revolution nearly half a century ago.Israeli and American strikes last June greatly weakened Iran&#x27;s air defences, military leadership and nuclear program. A regionwide war, sparked by Hamas&#x27; October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, has left Iran&#x27;s network of proxies across the Middle East greatly weakened. US sanctions and global isolation, meanwhile, have decimated Iran&#x27;s economy.Iran responded to the latest strikes by launching missiles and drones targeting Israel and strikes targeting US military installations in Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar. Israel&#x27;s military said Iran fired \"dozens\" of missiles at Israel, with many intercepted and no serious injuries reported. Emergency responder Magen David Adom noted 89 \"lightly injured\" people.At least three explosions were heard on Saturday evening near the Intelligence Ministry building in northern Tehran, witnesses said, adding that air defense systems had begun operating in the area.There was no immediate statement in Iranian media, while Israel&#x27;s military said it had begun a new wave of strikes against missile launchers and aerial defence systems in central Iran.In southern Iran, at least 85 people were reported killed after a girls&#x27; school was struck, and dozens more were wounded, the local governor told Iranian state TV.Capt. Tim Hawkins, a spokesman for US Central Command, said he was \"aware of reports\" that a girls&#x27; school was struck and they were looking into them.Flights across the Middle East were disrupted, and air defence fire thudded over Dubai, the United Arab Emirates&#x27; commercial capital.Shrapnel from an Iranian missile attack on the UAE capital killed one person, state media said.Attack was coordinated between Israel and USThe US military for weeks has amassed forces in the region, even as US and Iranian envoys held talks in Switzerland and Oman.\"Active and serious negotiations have yet again been undermined,\" Oman&#x27;s Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, a key mediator, said on X.\"Neither the interests of the United States nor the cause of global peace are well served by this.\"Israel said the operation has been planned for months with the US.\"Air Force pilots are striking hundreds of targets across Iran, at significant personal risk and in coordination with US strikes,\" Israeli military chief of staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said in a statement.Targets in the Israeli campaign included Iran&#x27;s military, symbols of government and intelligence targets, according to an official briefed on the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss non-public information on the attack.Trump, in seeking to justify the military action, claimed Iran has continued to develop its nuclear program, despite asserting last year the program had been \"obliterated\" by an earlier round of strikes.He acknowledged on Saturday that there could be American casualties, saying \"that often happens in war.\"It was a notable call from a US leader who swept into office on an \"America First\" platform and vowed to keep out of \"forever wars.\"Trump&#x27;s statement listed grievances beyond the nuclear program, stretching back to the beginning of the Islamic Republic, following a revolution in 1979 that turned Iran from an American ally into a fierce foe.The US president said he was aiming to \"annihilate\" the Iranian navy and destroy regional proxies supported by Tehran. He called on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to lay down arms, pledging members would be given immunity, while warning they would face \"certain death\" if they didn&#x27;t.Trump had threatened military action, but held off, following Iran&#x27;s recent crackdown on protests spurred by economic grievances that evolved into a nationwide, anti-government push against the ruling clerics.The Human Rights Activists News Agency says it confirmed more than 7000 deaths in the crackdown and is investigating thousands more. The government has acknowledged more than 3000 killed.Iran has said it hasn&#x27;t enriched uranium since June, but it has blocked international inspectors from visiting the sites America bombed. Satellite photos analysed by The Associated Press have shown new activity at two of those sites, suggesting Iran is trying to assess and potentially recover material there.Iran said it hoped to avert a war, but maintained its right to enrich uranium. Its leaders did not want to discuss other issues, such as its long-range missile program or support for armed groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.Regional effectsThe strikes could rattle global markets, particularly if Iran is able to make the Strait of Hormuz unsafe for commercial traffic. A third of total worldwide oil exports transported by sea passed through the strait in 2025.Saudi Arabia said in an announcement on state-run media that Iran had targeted its capital and its eastern region in an attack that was repelled.Kuwait&#x27;s civil aviation authority said a drone targeted the main international airport, injuring several employees. Kuwait&#x27;s health ministry said 12 people were injured in strikes. Bahrain said a missile attack targeted the US Navy&#x27;s 5th Fleet headquarters in the island kingdom. Explosions could also be heard in Qatar. Jordan said it \"dealt with\" 49 drones and ballistic missiles.The Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen vowed to resume attacks on Red Sea shipping routes and on Israel, according to two senior Houthi officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because there was no official announcement.US embassies or consulates in Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Israel said staffers were told to shelter in place and recommended all Americans \"do the same until further notice.\"Australia quick to react, issues urgent warnings Anthony Albanese issued a statement of support to the US in their strikes, labelling the Iranian regime \"a destabilising force\".\"We support the United States acting to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and to prevent Iran continuing to threaten international peace and security,\" the prime minister said.\"Iran directed at least two attacks on Australian soil in 2024. These appalling acts targeting Australia&#x27;s Jewish community were intended to create fear, divide our society and challenge our sovereignty.\"Albanese pointed out, in addition to sanctioning 200-Iranian linked individuals, Australia \"took the unprecedented steps of expelling Iran&#x27;s Ambassador\".Any Australians who are in Iran have been urged to leave the country, as the government issued a swift statement after news of the attacks broke on Saturday evening. \"There is a risk of reprisal attacks and further escalation across the region,\" it said in an updated travel advisory.\"Closure of airspace around transit hubs may impact flights globally, causing delays and cancellations.\"It also warned the Australian Embassy in Tehran had suspended its operations, meaning the ability for it to offer support for stranded Australians is \"extremely limited\". The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) also urged those in Israel and Lebanon to consider their future plans, advising \"the security situation could deteriorate rapidly throughout Israel with little or no notice\".\" The Australian Government has directed the departure of all dependants of Australian officials posted to Israel in response to the deteriorating security situation in the Middle East,\" they said.- Reported with Associated Press and CNN.

          "content": "US President Donald Trump has claimed Iranian&#x27;s could \"face death\" after the United States and Israel launched strikes against Iran on Saturday.In an eight-minute speech posted to his social media pages, Trump outlined his motivations to stop a group of \"very hard, terrible people.\"Watch Trump&#x27;s speech in full in the video above.LIVE UPDATES: US launches &#x27;major combat operations in Iran&#x27;READ TRUMP&#x27;S STATEMENT IN FULLA short time ago, the United States military began major combat operations in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime. A vicious group of very hard, terrible people. Its menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas, and our allies throughout the world.For 47 years, the Iranian regime has chanted Death to America and waged an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder, targeting the United States, our troops and the innocent people in many, many countries. Among the regime&#x27;s very first acts was to back a violent takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, holding dozens of American hostages for 444 days. In 1983, Iran&#x27;s proxies carried out the marine barracks bombing in Beirut that killed 241 American military personnel.In 2000, they knew and were probably involved with the attack on the USS Cole. Many died. Iranian forces killed and maimed hundreds of American service members in Iraq. The regime&#x27;s proxies have continued to launch countless attacks against American forces stationed in the Middle East in recent years, as well as U.S. naval and commercial vessels and international shipping lines. It&#x27;s been mass terror, and we&#x27;re not going to put up with it any longer.From Lebanon to Yemen and Syria to Iraq, the regime has armed, trained and funded terrorist militias that have soaked the earth with blood and guts. And it was Iran&#x27;s proxy, Hamas, that launched the monstrous Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, slaughtering more than 1,000 innocent people, including 46 Americans, while taking 12 of our citizens hostage. It was brutal, something like the world has never seen before.Iran is the world&#x27;s number one state sponsor of terror, and just recently killed tens of thousands of its own citizens on the street as they protested. It has always been the policy of the United States, in particular my administration, that this terrorist regime can never have a nuclear weapon. I&#x27;ll say it again, they can never have a nuclear weapon. That is why in Operation Midnight Hammer last June, we obliterated the regime&#x27;s nuclear program at Fort Doe, Natanz and Isfahan. After that attack, we warned them never to resume their malicious pursuit of nuclear weapons, and we sought repeatedly to make a deal. We tried. They wanted to do it. They didn&#x27;t want to do it. Again they wanted to do it. They didn&#x27;t want to do it. They didn&#x27;t know what was happening. They just wanted to practice evil. But Iran refused, just as it has for decades and decades.They&#x27;ve rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can&#x27;t take it anymore. Instead, they attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and to continue developing the long range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe, our troops stationed overseas, and could soon reach the American homeland. Just imagine how emboldened this regime would be if they ever had, and actually were armed with nuclear weapons as a means to deliver their message.For these reasons, the United States military is undertaking a massive and ongoing operation to prevent this very wicked, radical dictatorship from threatening America and our core national security interests. We&#x27;re going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally again obliterated. We&#x27;re going to annihilate their navy. We&#x27;re going to ensure that the region&#x27;s terrorist proxies can no longer destabilize the region or the world and attack our forces, and no longer use their IEDs, or roadside bombs as they are sometimes called, to so gravely wound and kill thousands and thousands of people, including many Americans. And we will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. It&#x27;s a very simple message. They will never have a nuclear weapon.This regime will soon learn that no one should challenge the strength and might of the United States Armed Forces. I built and rebuilt our military in my first administration and there is no military on earth even close to its power, strength or sophistication. My administration is taking every possible step to minimize the risk to U.S. personnel in the region. Even so, and I do not make this statement lightly, the Iranian regime seeks to kill. The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost, and we may have casualties. That often happens in war. But we&#x27;re doing this not for now. We&#x27;re doing this for the future. And it is a noble mission. We pray for every service member as they selflessly risk their lives to ensure that Americans and our children will never be threatened by a nuclear-armed Iran. We ask God to protect all of our heroes in harm&#x27;s way. And we trust that with his help, the men and women of the armed forces will prevail. We have the greatest in the world, and they will prevail.To the members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, the armed forces and all of the police, I say tonight that you must lay down your weapons and have complete immunity. Or in the alternative, face certain death. So, lay down your arms. You will be treated fairly with total immunity, or you will face certain death. Finally, to the great proud people of Iran, I say tonight that the hour of your freedom is at hand. Stay sheltered. Don&#x27;t leave your home. It&#x27;s very dangerous outside. Bombs will be dropping everywhere. When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.For many years, you have asked for America&#x27;s help. But you never got it. No president was willing to do what I am willing to do tonight. Now you have a president who is giving you what you want. So let&#x27;s see how you respond. America is backing you with overwhelming strength and devastating force. Now is the time to seize control of your destiny, and to unleash the prosperous and glorious future that is close within your reach. This is the moment for action. Do not let it pass.May God bless the brave men and women of America&#x27;s armed forces. May God bless the United States of America. May God bless you all. Thank you.
