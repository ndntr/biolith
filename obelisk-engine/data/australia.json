Plasencia texted another doctor that Perry was a \"moron\" who could be exploited for money, according to court filings.Perry had been taking the surgical anesthetic ketamine legally as a treatment for depression. But when his regular doctor wouldn&#x27;t provide it in the amounts he wanted, he turned to Plasencia.DONALD TRUMP: He loves to hammer &#x27;Sleepy Joe&#x27;. He&#x27;s turning into &#x27;Sleepy Don&#x27; \"Rather than do what was best for Mr Perry – someone who had struggled with addiction for most of his life – defendant sought to exploit Perry&#x27;s medical vulnerability for profit,\" the prosecution&#x27;s sentencing memo said.Plasencia&#x27;s lawyers tried to give a sympathetic portrait of him in their memo, as a man who rose out of poverty to become a doctor beloved by his patients, some of whom provided testimonials about him for the court.The attorneys called his selling to Perry \"reckless\" and \"the biggest mistake of his life.\"READ MORE: Meta begins locking out Australian children from social media accounts \"Remorse cannot begin to capture the pain, regret and shame that Mr Plasencia feels for the tragedy that unfolded and that he failed to prevent,\" the memo said.But, the lawyers wrote, \"a sentence of imprisonment is neither necessary nor warranted. He has already lost his medical licence, his clinic, and his career. He has also been viciously attacked in the media and threatened by strangers to the point where his family has moved out of state for their safety.\"Plasencia&#x27;s lawyers said he has moved to Arizona with his wife and two-year-old son, for whom he is a loving caretaker.\"I want him to be proud of his father,\" Plasencia said in a video he and his lawyers made for the judge.\"I made mistakes, but I want him to know that I tried to make better choices after my mistakes.\"Plasencia pleaded guilty in July to four counts of distribution of ketamine. Prosecutors agreed to drop five different counts.Perry&#x27;s mother Suzanne Perry and his stepfather, Dateline journalist Keith Morrison, attended the hearing.The other four defendants who reached deals to plead guilty will be sentenced at their own hearings in the coming months.Perry died at age 54 after struggling with addiction for years, dating back to his time on Friends, when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC&#x27;s megahit.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
