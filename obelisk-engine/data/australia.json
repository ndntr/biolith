          "content": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has urged reporters to read the Old Testament to better understand why quoting religious texts has been listed as an exemption under new laws to combat hate speech.The government released the draft Combating Antisemitism, Hate and Extremism bill to the public today, which will be debated when parliament is recalled early next week.Under the proposed legislation, unveiled in response to the terror attack at Bondi Beach, a new offence will be established for a person or group who publicly promotes or incites racial hatred, with a penalty of five years&#x27; imprisonment.READ MORE: Day of mourning date for Bondi terror attack revealedThere is, however, a narrow defence that would ensure the rules do not apply to actions that consist \"only of directly quoting from, or otherwise referencing, a religious text for the purpose of religious teaching or discussion\".Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the law would set a \" principles-based test\" for conduct and speech and defended the exemption for religious text.\"I encourage you to read the Old Testament and see what&#x27;s there and see if you outlaw that, what would occur,\" he told reporters this morning.\"So we need to be careful. We consulted with faith groups, not just with the Jewish community.\"We want to make sure there&#x27;s the broadest possible support for this legislation, but we also want to make sure that there isn&#x27;t unintended consequences of the legislation as well.\"However, Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive Peter Wertheim claimed the defence is a \"relic of outdated thinking\" and was effectively unnecessary.\"None of the world&#x27;s recognised religions promotes racial hatred knowingly and deliberately, and to the extent that any religion were to do so, it would be thoroughly shameful,\" he said in a statement.\"Invoking religion as an excuse to dehumanise and mistreat others simply on the basis of who they are, must surely be a thing of the past.\"READ MORE: Australian teen charged after allegedly making hoax mass shooting calls to the USAlbanese yesterday announced parliament will be recalled next Monday and Tuesday – earlier than the scheduled return on February 2 – to debate and potentially pass the bill.The bill includes a package of reforms that target both hate speech and firearms through the establishment of a gun buyback scheme, stricter gun import rules, harsher penalties for hate speech and stricter migration rules.\" The terrorists at Bondi Beach had hatred in their minds, but guns in their hands. This law will deal with both,\" Albanese said.Opposition Leader Sussan Ley yesterday said she was \"deeply sceptical\" about the decision to combine all the changes into one bill, and is reportedly believed to move to have the bill split in parliament next week.The Nationals have been openly critical of the proposed gun reforms, saying it would target lawful gun owners.Albanese denied that it would, instead saying the \"common sense\" measure would prevent people who are not citizens from owning guns and crack down on gun imports.\"I think Australians would also be surprised to hear the fact that there are more guns in Australia today than there were at the time of the Port Arthur massacre,\" he said.READ MORE: Record spending leads to Aussies facing immense credit card debtHealth Minister Mark Butler said the opposition&#x27;s comments highlighted their infighting. \"I think this is more about the divisions within the Coalition around gun control, rather than any artificial distinction between motives and method. Here we committed to dealing with both, and that is the legislation that we deliver next week,\" he told Today.Independent MP Allegra Spender, whose electorate covers Bondi, has raised concerns about the limited scope of the hate speech laws and will seek to expand them to cover all minority groups, including LGBTQI+ people. \"Neo-Nazis target the Jewish community, and they target the Muslim community, and they target the LGBTQ community, but only one group at this stage will be protected by race laws,\" she told ABC.\"This is also about consistency.\"Albanese has flagged he would be open to constructive changes, but said he would be surprised if the opposition and Greens did not pass the bill next Tuesday.
