          "content": "Two children have been shot dead and another two are fighting for life after a shooter opened fire through the windows of a US church, attacking a Mass marking the return to school, police say.Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O&#x27;Hara said a further 12 children and three adults were injured in the Wednesday morning (late Wednesday night AEST) shooting at the Annunciation Catholic School.The shooter has been identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, who had no prior criminal history and is understood to have acted alone. Westman took their own life after the shooting.READ MORE: Surprise bidder pays $15k for potentially uncomfortable flightO&#x27;Hara said the \"coward\" shooter fired what he estimated to be \"dozens\" of rounds from a rifle, shotgun and pistol through the church windows towards children sitting in the pews at the Mass.\"This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping,\" he said.\"The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible.\"FBI Director Kash Patel said on X that the shooting is being investigated as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics.Federal officials referred to Westman as transgender, and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey decried hatred being directed at \"our transgender community.\"Westman&#x27;s gender identity wasn&#x27;t clear. In 2020, a judge approved a petition, signed by Westman&#x27;s mother, asking for a name change from Robert to Robin, saying the petitioner \"identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.\"Westman&#x27;s uncle, former Kentucky state lawmaker Bob Heleringer, said he did not know the accused shooter well.He said he last saw Westman at a family wedding a few years ago and was confounded by the violence: \"It&#x27;s an unspeakable tragedy.\"The children who died were aged eight and 10 and their parents had been notified. First responders attempted first aid and worked to rescue some of the children still hiding in the church.Authorities were aware of a manifesto posted online, O&#x27;Hara said.O&#x27;Hara said the content, which the shooter had timed for release on YouTube, has been taken down and is under active review.Westman lawfully purchased the firearms used in shooting, the police chief said.An emotional Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned the shooting and told the families of the victims he was \"so deeply sorry\".\"There are no words that can capture the horror and the evil of this unspeakable act,\" an emotional Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said.\"Children are dead. There are families that have a deceased child.READ MORE: Someone killed Woody. But witnesses &#x27;never&#x27; discussed it\"You cannot put into words the gravity, the tragedy or the absolute pain of this situation.\"At a press conference after the horror shooting, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said everyone in the state was standing with the community during a time of tragedy.\"What happened here today will not be gone. Minnesotans will not step away,\" he said.He added that violence was all too common across the country and \"it&#x27;s Minnesota&#x27;s day today.\"\"It&#x27;s my strongest desire that no state, no community, no school ever experiences a day like this,\" he said.Walz said students were met with \"evil and horror and death\".\"There&#x27;s no words that&#x27;s going to ease the pain of the families today,\" he added.In a post on X, FBI Director Kash Patel said the shooting was being investigated as an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics.LIVE UPDATES: Hunt for accused cop killer enters third dayPope Leo XIV has sent a telegram of condolences over the shooting at the Catholic school, calling it a \"terrible tragedy\" and saying he was praying for relatives of the dead and injured \"at this extremely difficult time\".Leo, history&#x27;s first American pope, said he was \"profoundly saddened\" to learn about the shooting at Annunciation Catholic School church.He sent his condolences \"to all those affected by this terrible tragedy, especially the families now grieving the loss of a child.\"The Chicago-born Leo said he was praying for those injured and the medical teams and first responders at the scene, and for the broader Catholic community.The telegram was signed by the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and was addressed to Archbishop Bernard Hebda, the archbishop of St. Paul-Minneapolis.Michael Simpson said his 10-year-old grandson, Weston Halsne, was nicked by a bullet as he sat by the church windows.His voice shaking as he left the area around the school, Simpson said the violence during Mass on the third day of school left him wondering whether God was watching over.\"I don&#x27;t know where He is,\" Simpson said. Frey said this kind of evil act should never happen but \"it happens far too often\".\"Don&#x27;t just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now. These kids were literally praying,\" Frey said.\"It was the first week of school. They were in a church. \"These are kids that should be learning with their friends. They should be playing on the playground.\"They should be able to go to school or church in peace, without the fear or risk of violence and their parents should have the same kind of assurance.\"READ MORE: &#x27;That bloke could be anywhere&#x27;: Porepunkah fears as night falls againBill Bienemann, who lives a couple of blocks away and has long attended Mass at Annunciation Church, said he heard dozens of shots, perhaps as many as 50, over as long as four minutes.\"I was shocked. I said, &#x27;There&#x27;s no way that could be gunfire&#x27;,\" he said.\"There was so much of it. It was sporadic.\"READ MORE: Higgins responds after being ordered to pay huge sum in defamation caseBienemann&#x27;s daughter, Alexandra, said she attended the school from kindergarten to year 8, finishing in 2014. After she heard of the shooting, she said she was shaking and crying, and her boss told her to take the day off.\"It breaks my heart, makes me sick to my stomach, knowing that there are people I know who are either injured or maybe even killed,\" Alexandra Bienemann said.\"It doesn&#x27;t make me feel safe at all in this community that I have been in for so long.\"READ MORE: Aussies might be paying too much for mortgagesThe school was evacuated, and students&#x27; families later were directed to a \"reunification zone\" at the school.Outside, amid a heavy uniformed law enforcement presence, were uniformed children in their dark green shirts or dresses.Many were trickling out of the school with adults, giving lingering hugs and wiping away tears.Local, state, county and federal law enforcement officers and agents converged on the area, a leafy residential and commercial neighbourhood about eight kilometres south of downtown Minneapolis.On Truth Social, US President Donald Trump said he was briefed on the \"tragic shooting\" and that the White House would continue to monitor it.The pre-kindergarten through eighth grade school had an all-school Mass scheduled at 8.15am (11.15pm AEST), according to its website.Monday was the first day of school. Recent social media posts from the school show children smiling at a back-to-school event, holding up summer art projects, playing together and enjoying ice pops.At a meeting of Democratic officials elsewhere in Minneapolis, Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin noted the shooting and \"unknown amount of victims\".The gunfire was the latest in a series of fatal shootings in the city in less than 24 hours.One person was killed and six others were hurt in a shooting on Tuesday outside a high school in Minneapolis. Hours later, two people died in two other shootings in the city.Wednesday&#x27;s school shooting also followed a spate of hoax calls about purported shootings on at least a dozen US college campuses.The bogus warnings, sometimes featuring gunshot sounds in the background, prompted universities to issue texts to \"run, hide, fight\" and frightened students around the nation as the school year began.Readers seeking support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or beyond blue on 1300 22 4636. -with Associated Press",

There are concerns that the US will not provide Australia with its first Virginia-class submarine by the early 2030s as planned because American submarine building was behind schedule. The submarines are expected cost Australia up to $380 billion.The Trump administration is also pushing Australia to raise its defence spending, from 2 per cent to 3.5 per cent, as the US seeks to meet China&#x27;s military might in the Indo-Pacific.National Party Senator Bridget McKenzie told Today this morning, securing a sit-down meeting with Hegseth was crucial for the Australian government.\"He [Marles] secures Vance, he secures Rubio.
