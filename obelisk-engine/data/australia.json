          "content": "Fifteen innocent people and a gunman are confirmed dead after a mass shooting at Sydney&#x27;s Bondi Beach yesterday evening that targeted the Jewish community at a Hanukkah celebration.It has been deemed a terrorist attack.A girl aged 10 who died at Sydney Children&#x27;s Hospital is among the 15 victims, and at least 40 people were injured in the attack.LIVE UPDATES: Sixteen people dead, more injuredThe shooting was allegedly carried out by a father-son pair. The 50-year-old father was shot dead by police at the scene, while the other alleged gunman was arrested and taken to hospital in a critical condition.NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said it is \"likely\" the younger man will survive his wounds and be charged over the attack. Police said 14 people died at the scene and 42 people – including four children – were taken to hospitals across Sydney. Two of those injured later died in hospital.There are conflicting reports of how many people are still receiving treatment for their injuries, but NSW Health says 27 patients remain in hospitals across Sydney.Six of them are in a critical condition, six are critical but stable, and a further 15 are in a stable condition.Two of the injured are police officers who are in a serious but stable condition and have undergone surgery.One of those officers may lose sight in one of their eyes as a result of their injuries.NSW Health Minister Ryan Park told Today this morning extra healthcare staff have been called in to hospitals around Sydney to help relieve the sudden pressure of dozens of wounded patients being taken in.Here&#x27;s what we know about the terror attack so far. &#x27;INCREDIBLE GUY&#x27;: Rabbi identified as victimWhat happened at Bondi BeachTwo men opened fire from a bridge into Archer Park about 6.47pm (AEDT), where the Chanukah by the Sea 2025 festival for children was taking place.It&#x27;s believed there were more than 1000 people at the Jewish festival on what was the first day of Hanukkah, while thousands of others were at and around the beach during a warm summer evening. Some attendees and beachgoers initially thought the gunshots were fireworks, before thousands of people began to flee the beach , running into the water and nearby businesses and cafes.READ MORE: Witnesses recall moment shooters open fire at Bondi BeachThe shooting unfolded over nine minutes.Police were on the scene within five minutes. Police issued an alert just before 7pm, urging the public to avoid the area due to the \"developing incident\".Police discovered a car which was believed to contain several \"improvised explosives\" on Campbell Parade shortly after the shooting.Two \"rudimentary\" but live explosives were taken from the scene by the bomb squad and disarmed.READ MORE: Billionaire donates nearly $100k to Bondi shooting hero What we know about the shootersThe attackers have been confirmed by 9News as father and son Sajid Akram, 50, and Naveed Akram, 24. The older man is dead, while the younger was taken to hospital in a critical condition under police guard.He is expected to survive his injuries and face charges over the attack.\"We do have a 24-year-old male in hospital at the moment,\" Lanyon said.\"Based on his medical condition, it&#x27;s likely that person may face criminal charges.\"The older man was a registered gun licensee who was a member of a gun club and legally owned six long-arm firearms.READ MORE: What we know about the two Bondi Beach gunmenThat is the same number of guns that have been seized by police following the shooting. Sajid Akram moved to Australia on a student visa in 1988 before being transferred to a partner visa three years later.He was on a resident return visa (RRV) at the time of the shooting.Having been born here, Naveed is an Australian citizen who was investigated by ASIO for six months.\"The son first came to attention in October 2019,\" Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said.\"He was examined on the basis of being associated with others and the assessment was made that there was no indication of any ongoing threat or threat of him engaging in violence...\"(He was investigated because of) people he was associated with, rather than things that he, himself, had done.\"Police confirmed there were only two shooters after investigating reports of a third gunman.Today, a major police operation was launched in Campsie at a home which is believed to have been used as short-term accommodation by the attackers.It&#x27;s understood that tactical officers were involved in the operation, as well as the Australian Federal Police.It follows an earlier raid overnight on a property in Bonnyrigg, believed to be linked to one of the attackers.Several people in the home were arrested and spoke with police this morning.&#x27;ABSOLUTE MASSACRE&#x27;: Bloodied witness describes chaos The weapons usedLongarm firearms were used. Police have seized six guns, which are believed to all be legally owned by the older shooter, although this is yet to be officially confirmed.Hero who disarmed gunman named Extraordinary footage emerged yesterday of a bystander appearing to wrestle a rifle from one of the gunmen while horrified witnesses filmed.He has been identified today as 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed, from Sydney&#x27;s south. Witness Alexander told 9News he was watching the man as he grabbed the gun and then pointed it at the suspected shooter.\"God bless him,\" Alexander said.\"We had a man like that... who put his own life at risk to save some more lives and not to escalate it to the next level.\"WATCH: Hero wrestles gun from attacker What we know about the victimsOne of the victims has been identified as a rabbi who helped organise the Hanukkah event. Rabbi Eli Schlanger, 41, was named by both the official X account of Hasidic Jewish movement Chabad, and his cousin Zalman Lewis on Instagram, as one of the 16 people killed in the attack.The Chabad.org account said Schlanger was an assistant rabbi at Chabad of Bondi.The youngest victim has been identified as 10-year-old girl Matilda, who was remembered by her language teacher as a \"bright, joyful, and spirited child who brought light to everyone around her\". A young French national, Dan Elkayam, has been identified as another victim, as has former police officer and current rugby union volunteer Peter Meagher.Chabad.org also named two other victims: Reuven Morrison, a member of the Chabad community; and 87-year-old Alex Kleytman, a Holocaust survivor and the oldest victim of the massacre.A total of 14 people died at the scene, while two others – 10-year-old Matilda and a 40-year-old man – have since died in hospital.&#x27;EVIL ANTISEMITISM&#x27;: PM says &#x27;justice will be done&#x27; Two police officers are among those shot and injured.

No stone will be left unturned.\"Lanyon also called for calm in the community.\"Retribution or acts against any part of any community will not be accepted,\" he said.\"We will have a significant policing presence. This is a time for the community to come together.\"This is a time that police will take action to make sure the community feels safe.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
