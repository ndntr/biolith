On Thursday, six search warrants were conducted across Sydney, including in Waterloo, Ultimo and Malabar.Landon Germanotta-Mills, 26, was arrested in Waterloo in Sydney&#x27;s southern suburbs and is alleged to be the leader of the group.Germanotta-Mills is the founder of the Underground Media Network, which describes itself as an independent investigative journalism platform.The platform on its website claims to investigate issues in \"child protection... [and] public interest harm\".\"We centre survivors, whistleblowers, and community voices — especially where institutions have failed to act,\" the website reads.Germanotta-Mills was taken to Mascot Police Station, where he was charged with multiple offences, including seven counts of using a carriage service to access child abuse material.READ MORE: Hit with an unusual spring flu? Turns out you aren&#x27;t aloneAt a unit block in Malabar in Sydney&#x27;s eastern suburbs, three men aged 46, 42 and 39 were arrested and taken to Maroubra Police Station.One of those arrested was Mark Sendecky, a former swimming coach.Sendecky was charged with possessing child abuse data using a carriage service, accessing child abuse material, and possessing child abuse material. Speaking to media, Detective Superintendent Jayne Doherty said the material was \"abhorrent\" and outlined some of the alleged activities of the group.\"[They engaged] in conversations and the sharing of material which depicted child abuse and the torture of children,\" she said.\" Police will allege in court that the initial examination of these devices has discovered thousands of videos depicting the abuse of live children between the ages of babies and 12 years of age.\"Amongst these deplorable images were also a number of videos depicting the sexual abuse of animals.\"Police are not alleging the men created the material. READ MORE: Why millions of Aussies could lose thousands by the end of the yearDoherty said the material was particularly appalling due to the sinister connotations behind it.\" These ones were particularly devastating in [that] they used symbols and rituals around it in the discussions about abusing children,\" she said.\"It had a ritualistic overview.\"Police charged the oldest man with multiple offences, including using a carriage service to make child abuse available.The 39-year-old was also charged with multiple offences, including possessing child abuse material and possessing bestiality material.READ MORE: Millions facing more electricity outages when critical power plant closesDoherty confirmed the men were allegedly part of an international group dealing with \"satanic child abuse material\", but said she police could not confirm the specific identity of any of the children involved, or if any of them are from Australia. \"We&#x27;ve not identified an actual child, but the images are of real children,\" she said.There is also no confirmation the men had any immediate access to children, but Doherty said the risk to the community was still high, hence the arrests being made.\" There are no specific children they had access to, but they were put in our community and we were concerned for the children within the community,\" she said.All men were refused bail and appeared in court on Friday.They will next appear at Downing Centre Local Court on January 27 and January 29 next year.Support is available from the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service at 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732).Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
