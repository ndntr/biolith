          "content": "Hawaii&#x27;s Kilauea volcano resumed erupting this weekend by shooting an arc of lava 100 feet (30 meters) into the air and across a section of its summit crater floor.It was Kilauea&#x27;s 31st display of molten rock since December, an appropriately high frequency for one of the world&#x27;s most active volcanoes.The north vent at the summit crater began continuously spattering in the morning, and then lava overflowed a few hours later. The vent started shooting lava fountains in the afternoon.READ MORE: Abandoned train station in Sydney&#x27;s east to be revivedThe eruption was contained within the summit crater, and no homes were threatened.A few lucky residents and visitors will have a front-row view at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. If the past is a guide, hundreds of thousands more will be watching popular livestreams made possible by three camera angles set up by the U.S. Geological Survey.Whenever she gets word the lava is back, Park Service volunteer Janice Wei hustles to shoot photos and videos of Halemaumau Crater — which Native Hawaiian tradition says is the home to the volcano goddess Pele.She said that when the molten rock shoots high like a fountain, it sounds like a roaring jet engine or crashing ocean waves; she can feel its heat from over a mile away.READ MORE: Thousands to flood Brisbane&#x27;s CBD for pro-Palestine rally “Every eruption feels like I am sitting in the front row at nature’s most extraordinary show,” Wei said in an email.Kilauea is on Hawaii Island, the largest of the Hawaiian archipelago. It’s about 200 miles (320 kilometers) south of the state’s largest city, Honolulu, which is on Oahu.Here’s what to know about Kilauea’s latest eruption:Towering fountains of molten rockA lower magma chamber under Halemaumau Crater is receiving magma directly from the earth’s interior at about 5 cubic yards (3.8 cubic meters) per second, said Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.This blows the chamber up like a balloon and forces magma into an upper chamber. From there it gets pushed above ground through cracks.Magma has been using the same pathway to rise to the surface since December, making the initial release and subsequent episodes all part of the same eruption, Hon said.Many have featured lava soaring into the air, in some cases more than 1,000 feet (300 meters). The fountains are generated in part because magma — which holds gases that are released as it rises — has been travelling to the surface through narrow, pipelike vents.READ MORE: Alleged arsonist targets popular Queen Victoria Market in MelbourneThe expanding magma supply is capped by heavier magma that had expelled its gas at the end of the prior episode. Eventually enough new magma accumulates to force the degassed magma off, and the magma shoots out like a Champagne bottle that was shaken before the cork was popped.This is the fourth time in 200 years that Kilauea has shot lava fountains into the air in repeated episodes. There were more episodes the last time Kilauea followed this pattern: The eruption that began in 1983 started with 44 sessions of shooting fountains.Those were spread out over three years, however. And the fountains emerged in a remote area, so few got to watch.The other two occurred in 1959 and 1969.Predicting Kilauea’s futureScientists don’t know how the current eruption will end or how it may change.In 1983 magma built enough pressure that Kilauea opened a vent at a lower elevation and started continuously leaking lava from there rather than periodically shooting out of a higher elevation. The eruption continued in various forms for three decades and ended in 2018.Something similar could happen again. Or the current eruption could instead stop at the summit if its magma supply peters out.Scientists can estimate a few days or even a week ahead of time when lava is likely to emerge with the help of sensors around the volcano that detect earthquakes and minuscule changes in the angle of the ground, which indicate when magma is inflating or deflating.READ MORE: Police hunt escapee, 39, who &#x27;shouldn&#x27;t be approached&#x27; “Our job is like being a bunch of ants crawling on an elephant trying to figure out how the elephant works,” Hon said.The lava fountains have been shorter lately. Steve Lundblad, a University of Hawaii at Hilo geology professor, said the vent may have gotten wider, leaving molten rock less pressurised.“We’re still gonna have spectacular eruptions,” he said. “They’re just going to be wider and not as high.”Carrying stories of PeleSome people may see lava flows as destructive. But Huihui Kanahele-Mossman, the executive director of the Edith Kanakaʻole Foundation, said lava is a natural resource that hardens into land and forms the foundation for everything on Hawaii Island.Kanahele-Mossman’s nonprofit is named after her grandmother — the esteemed practitioner of Hawaiian language and culture and founder of a noted hula halau, or school.Hālau o Kekuhi is celebrated for its mastery of a style of hula rooted in the stories of Pele and her sister, Hiʻiaka.Kanahele-Mossman has visited the crater a few times since the eruption began. She initially watches in awe and reverence, but then she observes more details so she can go home and compare it to the lava in the centuries-old tales that her school performs.READ MORE: Man falls to his death i n Adelaide while &#x27;retrieving rubbish&#x27;While at the crater, she also delivers a chant prepared in advance and places offerings. Recently she presented awa, a drink made with kava, and a fern lei.“You as the dancer, you are the storyteller and you carry that history that was written in those mele forward,” she said, using the Hawaiian word for song.“To be able to actually see that eruption that’s described in the mele, that’s always exciting to us and drives us and motivates us to stay in this tradition.”DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
