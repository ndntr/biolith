Tarrant suggested that signs of mental illness he displayed hadn’t been recorded and that at times he had sought to mask them.“I was definitely doing everything possible to come across as confident, assured, mentally well,” he told the court.Tarrant’s behavior “reflected the political movement I’m a part of,” he added. “So I always wanted to put on the best front possible.”He agreed that he had had access to legal advice throughout the court process. Tarrant’s current lawyers have been granted name suppression because they feared representing him would make them unsafe.READ MORE: &#x27;Stop the nonsense&#x27;: Vonn&#x27;s failed gamble divides the worldThe appeal outcome is due laterBids to appeal convictions or sentences in New Zealand must be made within 20 working days. Tarrant was about two years late in seeking an appeal, filing documents with the court in September 2022.He told the court on Monday that his bid had been late because he hadn’t had access to the information required to make it.The hearing is due to run for the rest of the week but the judges are expected to release their decision at a later date.If they reject Tarrant’s attempt to have his guilty pleas discarded, a later hearing will focus on his bid to appeal his sentence.",
