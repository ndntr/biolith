My attitude is if someone can do a better job than I can, fair enough. But don&#x27;t write me off at the moment.\"Hanson confirmed she had made a formal offer for Joyce to join One Nation, but he did not commit and is awaiting the outcome of a bill he introduced in parliament opposing net-zero. READ MORE: US military kills two people in strike on suspected drug boat in PacificIn what could be a dramatic turnaround, Joyce&#x27;s colleague and friend, Nationals Senator Bridget McKenzie, said she believed he would not even cross over to One Nation.\"Barnaby loves the party. He&#x27;s given us a lot, and we&#x27;ve given him a lot. And I think he&#x27;ll be staying where he is, if not in the room,\" she said told Today.McKenzie added that several Nationals MPs, including deputy leader Kevin Hogan, have taken a \"break\" from the party room \"every now and then\". \"I think there&#x27;s been a lot of hoopla about nothing,\" she said.Nationals leader David Littleproud has urged Joyce to stay in the party and is speaking to him to make sure his contribution is \"valued\" amid policy differences.READ MORE: Attorney-general requests review into decision to release Snowtown killer on paroleMore infighting over in the Coalition Joyce&#x27;s potential defection to One Nation has raised fears that he would take other Nationals members with him as Hanson ramps up her campaigning in regional territory.The Coalition is struggling to increase its influence and win back voters after its historic defeat at the federal election in May. Not long after that loss, the Nationals and Liberals had their own relationship breakdown when they split for the first time since the 1980s, before coming back together in what was a short-lived separation.The Coalition is also failing to shake off very public infighting, with Opposition Leader Sussan Ley coming under fire from her colleagues this week over her call for Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to sack Ambassador to the US Kevin Rudd over an awkward exchange with US President Donald Trump during his first meeting at the White House.READ MORE: Louvre boss admits failure after jewel heist, says she offered to resignAlbanese laughed off the exchange, and Trump reportedly accepted an off-camera apology from Rudd. The moment was dismissed as Rudd was praised for his efforts in securing a historic rare earth and critical mineral deal with the Trump administration.Backbench Senator Jane Hume said Ley&#x27;s comments were \"churlish\". \"The work clearly has been done on critical minerals and rare earths by Kevin Rudd personally, and I think that he should be acknowledged for that good work,\" she told Sky News.READ MORE: UK PM backs inquiry into Andrew&#x27;s rent-free Royal Lodge leaseLey later walked back her comments, saying \"Kevin Rudd is the prime minister&#x27;s choice for ambassador, it&#x27;s a big job\", and welcomed the remark from her \"talented backbench\".Former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also dismissed her calls in a letter praising the federal government for its \"10/10\" meeting and deal with Trump.McKenzie also supported Rudd&#x27;s efforts and gave him \"credit where it&#x27;s due\".\" Ambassador Rudd&#x27;s worked behind the scenes for months to land this deal. It all looks like it just happens in the room and it&#x27;s hammered out, people sign and away we go, but that would have taken months of painstaking negotiation to get the deal done,\" she told Today.\"There are plenty of good reasons to have a beef. This isn&#x27;t one of them.\"The Coalition has already lost two members, Andrew Hastie and Jacinta Price, from its frontbench over even more infighting.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
