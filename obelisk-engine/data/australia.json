Bottles filled with shards of glass were being thrown at the police, rotten fruit was being thrown at police, bins were put on fire, flags were on fire, and I think enough&#x27;s enough.\"READ MORE: Teenagers charged with attempted carjacking, delivery driver allegedly threatened during separate incidents in MelbourneCheeseman said that in the efforts to disperse the crowd, four flash bangs, two stinger balls, one rubber bullet, and 50 rounds of VKS pepper balls - similar to pepper spray - were used by police. Cheeseman claimed those who \"picked a fight\" with police were only seen within the counter-protest group and not within the March for Australia group.\" The people that came to pick the fight with police are the issue-motivated groups on the left,\" Cheeseman said.\"I can tell you that the March for Australia group were peaceful, they were engaging, they listened to our instructions, they did what they were told, and they protested by example.\"Cheeseman refused to confirm the exact number of protesters from both sides, but believed around 1000 people were present in Melbourne on Sunday. Reports from The Age claim some witnesses heard racist conspiracy theories being shared by some in the anti-immigration rally; Cheeseman said Victoria Police had zero tolerance for racism and would investigate such claims, but said there were no reports of poor behaviour in the main protest.READ MORE: More than 1600 customers of Dodo and iPrimus impacted by cybersecurity breach\"We are certainly not tolerant of that sort of language and that rhetoric. I will say on this occasion they were good, but I&#x27;m aware of behaviours in the past,\" he said.One person has been arrested for the alleged assault on the female police officer, and police believe more will follow.Cheeseman also said three other people were hit by rocks, but there were no other reports of injuries to either police or protesters.However, reports from The Age stated medical personnel were seen treating people who allegedly received injuries from the police flashbangs, including injuries to the chest and legs. He said police were happy to defend people&#x27;s right to protest, but said police have the right to be safe while working.\"We don&#x27;t come to work to get assaulted, we don&#x27;t come to work to get these rocks thrown at us, we come to work to make sure it&#x27;s a safe environment for everybody, for the left, for the right, everybody,\" he said.\"Yet we somehow find ourselves the target of behaviour that is simply unacceptable... I can see something very serious happening, and it could happen at the drop of a hat.\"READ MORE: More than 1600 customers of Dodo and iPrimus impacted by cybersecurity breachThe March for Australia protesters eventually walked away from the counter-protesters after 1pm and marched along Spring St.In Sydney, police estimated around 5000 people gathered in the CBD for an anti-immigration protest, but a counter-protest of a similar size was also mounted.There were no reports of injuries, clashes or arrests in Sydney, with other protests and counter-protests popping up all over the country on Sunday.Thousands gathered for an anti-immigration protest in Brisbane, with politician Bob Katter seen amongst the crowd.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

The report said they used a freight elevator to gain direct access to the targeted room in the Apollo Gallery.After breaking windows, they reportedly stole \"nine pieces from the jewellery collection of Napoleon and the Empress\".The Louvre has a long history of thefts and attempted robberies. The most famous was in 1911, when the Mona Lisa vanished from its frame, stolen by Vincenzo Peruggia, a former worker who hid inside the museum and walked out with the painting under his coat. It was recovered two years later in Florence — an episode that helped make Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s portrait the world&#x27;s best-known artwork.In 1983, two Renaissance-era pieces of armour were stolen from the Louvre and only recovered nearly four decades later. The museum&#x27;s collection also bears the legacy of Napoleonic-era looting that continues to spark restitution debates today.The Louvre is home to more than 33,000 works spanning antiquities, sculpture and painting — from Mesopotamia, Egypt and the classical world to European masters. Its star attractions include the Mona Lisa, as well as the Venus de Milo and the Winged Victory of Samothrace.The Galerie d&#x27;Apollon, where Sunday&#x27;s theft reportedly took place, displays a selection of the French Crown Jewels.The museum can draw up to 30,000 visitors a day.More to come.",

Hours later, Pakistan struck across the border.Pakistani security officials confirmed to The Associated Press Saturday that there were strikes on two districts in Afghanistan&#x27;s eastern Paktika province.The targets were hideouts of the militant Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, according to the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to the media.One said the operation was a direct response to the suicide bombing of a security forces compound in Mir Ali, in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province a day earlier.READ MORE: Albert risked his life to cure tuberculosis. But someone else took credit The Pakistani Air Force raids killed dozens of armed fighters and there were no civilian deaths, they said.But Afghan officials said the aerial assaults killed at least 10 civilians, including women, children and local cricketers.The attacks prompted the national cricket board to boycott an upcoming series in Pakistan.On Saturday, several thousand people attended funeral prayers in Paktika.They sat in the open air as loudspeakers broadcast sermons and condemnation.Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban government’s chief spokesman, in a statement, criticised the “repeated crimes of Pakistani forces and the violation of Afghanistan’s sovereignty.”Such acts were deemed provocative and viewed as “deliberate attempts” to prolong the conflict, he added.The two countries share a 2611-kilometre border known as the Durand Line, but Afghanistan has never recognised it.Pakistan is grappling with surging militancy, especially in areas bordering Afghanistan.It also accuses its nuclear-armed neighbour and rival India of backing armed groups, without providing any evidence.Pakistan&#x27;s army chief, Asim Munir, urged Afghans to choose “mutual security over perpetual violence and progress over hardline obscurantism.”“The Taliban must rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan,” he told an audience on Saturday at the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
