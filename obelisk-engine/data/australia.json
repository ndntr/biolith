Tools to create deepfakes can be exploited to create non-consensual and fake explicit images of a person, with women and girls the most likely targets.The eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, in June said deepfakes are a \"current crisis affecting school communities across Australia\".\"Students have found their image represented in fake nude photos or videos,\" the commissioner wrote at the time.\"Others have received AI-generated explicit content of their peers. Entire school communities have been thrown into turmoil – with families, educators, and students unsure how to respond.\"Inman Grant added that deepfakes are \"increasingly in use\" among young people.Readers seeking support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or beyond blue on 1300 22 4636.Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800.",
