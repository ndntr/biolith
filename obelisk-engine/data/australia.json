          "content": "A helicopter pilot involved in one of Australia&#x27;s worst air disasters was seen taking cocaine at a party a day before the fatal crash, a coroner has heard.Ashley Jenkinson, 40, was among four people who died when his Sea World chopper collided mid-air with another helicopter outside the Gold Coast theme park on January 2, 2023.Two people told an inquest into the tragedy they saw the pilot inhale a white substance they assumed was cocaine at a 2022 New Year&#x27;s Eve party.READ MORE: Japanese encephalitis detected in rural VictoriaIndustrial oil salesman Stephen Gill said Jenkinson used cocaine numerous times a year and may have taken it in the early hours of January 1, a day before the fatal crash.Gill testified he entered a shed at the party about 8pm and saw a \"white powder substance\" on a toolbox.Asked by counsel assisting Ryan Nattrass when had he seen the pilot use cocaine before, Gill said: \"Four or five times a year. Probably three or four lines throughout the night\".Gill saw the pilot last use cocaine at midnight on January 1 and could have taken it at 3am, coroner Carol Lee heard.Digital marketing company director Ross Meadows testified at the coronial inquiry in Brisbane on Tuesday he had been \"best mates\" with Jenkinson.He saw the pilot inhaling a white substance in the shed about 9pm at the 2022 party, Lee heard.\"I saw a white substance. I assumed it was cocaine,\" Meadows said.The pilot inhaled a single line of the substance, Lee heard, with Meadows remarking at the time: \"Nothing good comes from that shit\".Jenkinson tested positive to cocaine during an autopsy, Lee previously heard.He was \"unlikely to have been directly affected by the drug at the time of the accident,\" a previous Australian Transport Safety Bureau investigation found.Meadows said he had been taught by Jenkinson how to fly helicopters, describing him as a \"phenomenal pilot\".\"He was a very serious person,\" he said.READ MORE: Teen jailed for 17 years after stabbing doctor to deathMeadows did not think to report his mate to aviation authorities and did not speak to him about cocaine use, Lee heard.\"He was his own person. I&#x27;m not responsible,\" he said.Jenkinson was killed along with British newlyweds Ronald and Diane Hughes - aged 65 and 67 - and Sydney mother Vanessa Tadros, 36, in the horror crash.Under cross-examination from Tadros family barrister Gerard Mullins KC, Meadows said he knew cocaine and flying did not mix.\"An important part of a helicopter organisation targeting tourists is to promote themselves as a safe operator? Did it not occur to you to let them know of this illegal cocaine use?\" Mullins said.\"No,\" Meadows said.Vanessa Tadros&#x27; son Nicholas was aged just 10 when he lost his leg in the crash.He attended the inquest on Tuesday with his father, Simon Tadros.Meadows&#x27; company had provided social media marketing for Sea World Helicopters, Lee heard.Sea World owner Village Roadshow Theme Parks sold its joy flights operation to Sea World Helicopters in 2019.The inquest is due to hear from Sea World Helicopters executives next week.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
