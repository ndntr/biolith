Moore. He faces a first-degree murder charge that could be upgraded to capital murder, Scott said.Moore may face additional murder charges as the investigation proceeds.The shootings took place in the rural community of Cedarbluff, west of the county seat of West Point.\"This guy (the suspect) wasn’t our radar,” Scott said. “This is family members that he went after.”READ MORE: Filipino rescuers detect &#x27;signs of life&#x27; in garbage avalancheOnline court records in Clay County show Moore has no previous criminal charges.“A situation like this, you’ve got a family member attacking their own family,” Scott said.“Whatever the reason is, we’re hoping that we’ll find out.”Scott said investigators believe Moore placed a gun to the head of a younger child at the home where the seven-year-old died. Investigators aren’t sure whether the gun misfired.A third young child and their mother was present in that house as well.The seven-year-old victim was Moore’s second cousin, Scott said.Investigators hope to have more information and upgraded charges by the time Moore appears before a judge.An initial appearance is scheduled for Monday.Scott said no other injuries have been reported beyond the six deaths.Scott said evidence and witnesses indicate Moore was the only shooter.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

A severe weather warning is currently in place for heavy to locally intense rainfall and damaging winds about the northeast and central Queensland coasts.Heavy rainfall which could lead to flash flooding is forecast to develop from Ingham to Proserpine tonight.Locally intense rainfall, which the BoM says \"may lead to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooring\", is possible between Townsville and Proserpine overnight, extending south to Mackay on Sunday.
