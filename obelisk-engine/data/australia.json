It&#x27;s made $20 millionThe report looked at three key warming scenarios in Australia: 1.5 degrees, 2 degrees and three degrees of warming.It found the planet is heading towards 2.9 degrees of warming by 2030.Warming of this level would result in heatwave deaths skyrocketing by 444 per cent in Sydney and 423 per cent in Darwin.READ MORE: Teacher who beat cancer killed in tragic jet ski accidentThe rising temperatures will then increase the risk of communicable diseases from mosquitos and ticks.\"Public health risks will become more pronounced, with a significant potential for loss of life and strain on health systems,\" the report noted.Among the natural disasters and environmental crises we could face as temperatures rise are more frequent category 4 and 5 cyclones, large hail on the east coast and an increased risk of bushfires in forested areas.Dangerous fire weather days are projected to become more frequent in southern and eastern areas too.The assessment also noted 63 \"nationally significant\" climate risks.These include threats to Australia&#x27;s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, risks to infrastructure, mental health impacts and loss of animal species.Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen said the report made it clear that vulnerable Australians in rural communities will bear the brunt of climate change.\"Whether it be cropping, cattle sheep, fisheries… the report makes clear that Australia&#x27;s regional areas will be big losers from climate change,\" Bowen said.\"We are living [through] climate change now, it&#x27;s no longer a forecast, projection, or prediction.\"It is a lived reality. It is too late to avoid any impact now. But it&#x27;s not too late to avoid the worst of the impacts.\"The financial impact of climate change in Australia is predicted to be astronomical.Losses in property value could soar to $611 billion by 2050 and may reach $770 billion by 2090.Disaster costs for each state and territory for flood, bushfire, storm surge and tropical cyclones for a moderate emissions scenario (+1.5 degrees ) could reach an annual cost of $40.3 billion by 2050 too.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

The suspect in the killing struggled with mental illness and was living in a homeless shelter, the suspect&#x27;s mother told CNN.Co-host Lawrence Jones said taxpayers have given \"billions of dollars to mental health and the homeless population,\" but \"a lot of them don&#x27;t want to take the programs, a lot of them don&#x27;t want to get the help that is necessary.\"\"You can&#x27;t give them a choice,\" Jones continued.\"Either you take the resources that we&#x27;re going to give you … or you decide that you are going to be locked up in jail. That&#x27;s the way it has to be now.\"READ MORE: Accused Kirk shooter&#x27;s relationship with trans partner examinedThat&#x27;s what prompted Kilmeade to add, \"Or involuntary lethal injection or something. Just kill &#x27;em\".The condemnation was swift once the clip went viral on Saturday. Political figures such as California Governor Gavin Newsom weighed in. (Newsom replied to the video clip with a proverb: \"Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor will himself call out and not be answered.\")Christine Quinn, the CEO of WIN, which runs shelters and transitional housing in New York City, called Kilmeade&#x27;s rhetoric \"completely devoid of all humanity\" and said it \"only serves to divide and inflame\".Quinn said in a statement that she welcomed a dialogue with Kilmeade about the issues. Or \"better yet,\" she said, \"come volunteer in one of our shelters and see the face of homelessness for yourself – we could always use the help.\"READ MORE: Teacher who beat cancer killed in tragic jet ski accidentKilmeade appeared remotely on Sunday&#x27;s Fox & Friends Weekend, and Jones tossed to him, knowing Kilmeade had some cleaning up to do.Kilmeade said that on Wednesday \"we were discussing the murder of Iryna Zarutska in Charlotte and how to stop these kinds of attacks by homeless, mentally ill assailants, including institutionalising or jailing such people so they cannot attack again\".\"Now during that discussion, I wrongly said they should get lethal injections,\" Kilmeade said.\"I apologise for that extremely callous remark. I am obviously aware that not all mentally ill, homeless people act as the perpetrator did in North Carolina, and that so many homeless people deserve our empathy and compassion.\"Fox News also publicised the apology on its website, saying Kilmeade \"admits fault,\" perhaps in an attempt to defuse any further fallout.A Fox News spokesperson did not respond to CNN&#x27;s request for comment.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
