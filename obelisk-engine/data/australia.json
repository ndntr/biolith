          "content": "The Australian government has thrown its support behind the United States&#x27; strike on ISIS terrorists in Nigeria.President Donald Trump said that the US launched a \"powerful and deadly\" strike against Islamic State forces in Nigeria, after spending weeks accusing the West African country&#x27;s government of failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.In a Christmas evening post on his social media site, Trump did not provide details or mention the extent of the damage caused by the strikes.

Its extremist, violent ideology must be stopped,\" she said in a statement.Smartraveller warns Australians to reconsider their overall need to travel to Nigeria due to the volatile security situation and the high risk of terrorism, kidnapping, violent crime and the risk of civil unrest.The warning is elevated to\"do not travel\" in several parts of Nigeria, including Anambra, Borno, Delta, Niger and Kogi.Nigeria is battling multiple armed groups, including at least two affiliated with the Islamic State — an offshoot of the Boko Haram extremist group known as the Islamic State West Africa Province in the northeast, and the less-known Lakurawa group prominent in the northwestern states like Sokoto where the gangs use large swathes of forests connecting states as hideouts.Security analysts said the target of the US strikes could be the Lakurawa group, which in the last year has increasingly become lethal in the region, often targeting remote communities and security forces.\"Lakurawa is a group that is actually controlling territories in Nigeria, in Sokoto state and in other states like Kebbi,\" said Malik Samuel, a Nigerian security researcher at Good Governance Africa.\"In the northwest, there has been the incursion of violent extremist groups that are ideologically driven,\" he said, blaming the incursion on the near absence of the state and security forces in hot spots.Nigeria&#x27;s government has previously said in response to Trump&#x27;s criticisms that people of many faiths, not just Christians, have suffered attacks at the hands of extremists groups.READ MORE: Police release details of arson suspect after car with Hanukkah signage firebombedTrump ordered the Pentagon last month to begin planning for potential military action in Nigeria to try and curb the so-called Christian persecution.The State Department recently announced it would restrict visas for Nigerians and their family members involved in killing Christians there.And the US recently designated Nigeria a \"country of particular concern\" under the International Religious Freedom Act.Trump said the US defence officials had \"executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing\" and added that \"our Country will not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper\".Nigeria&#x27;s population of 220 million is split almost equally between Christians and Muslims.The country has long faced insecurity from various fronts including the Boko Haram extremist group, which seeks to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law and has also targeted Muslims it deems not Muslim enough.But attacks in Nigeria often have varying motives.There are religiously motivated ones targeting both Christians and Muslims, clashes between farmers and herders over dwindling resources, communal rivalries, secessionist groups and ethnic clashes.The US security footprint has diminished in Africa, where military partnerships have either been scaled down or cancelled.US forces likely would have to be drawn from other parts of the world for any larger-scale military intervention in Nigeria.Trump has nonetheless kept up the pressure as Nigeria faced a series of attacks on schools and churches in violence that experts and residents say targets both Christians and Muslims.Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth posted yesterday night on X: \"The President was clear last month: the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end.\"Hegseth said US military forces are \"always ready, so ISIS found out tonight — on Christmas\" and added, \"More to come…Grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation\" before signing off, \"Merry Christmas!\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
