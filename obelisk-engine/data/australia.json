The captured pair are due to make their first appearance in a New York court on narco-terrorism and cocaine importation conspiracy charges on Monday (Tuesday morning AEDT).READ MORE: Trump attacked Venezuela and arrested its president. Is that legal? READ MORE: Trump declares US will take control of Venezuela&#x27;s massive oil reservesMexico&#x27;s president rejects US interventionMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has restated her opposition to the US military intervention in Venezuela and defended her administration&#x27;s efforts to address drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States.\"We categorically reject the intervention in the internal affairs of other countries,\" Sheinbaum said during her daily news briefing on Monday (Tuesday morning AEDT).\"Latin American history is clear and overwhelming. Intervention has never brought democracy, never has generated wellbeing, nor lasting stability.\"The president noted 300 tonnes of drugs seized by Mexican authorities and a drop in homicides during her presidency, but added that the US has a responsibility to address its demand for drugs.Sheinbaum said her administration had previously agreed with the Trump administration to collaborate and coordinate while respecting each country&#x27;s sovereignty.

We hope that President Edmundo González Urrutia, elected in 2024, will be able to ensure this transition as quickly as possible,\" Macron wrote on X.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said his government would \"take our time\" to evaluate the developments in Venezuela. Merz added that \"a transition to a government legitimised by elections must be ensured\" and said \"political instability must not arise in Venezuela\".https://x.com/Keir_Starmer/status/2007540837224255602Some celebration Opposition Leader Sussan Ley said she welcomed the news and that Maduro was now facing justice after serving as an \"illegitimate president\". \"Under his rule, Venezuela has endured years of repression, systemic human rights abuses, corruption, and the crushing of basic democratic freedoms,\" Ley said in a joint statement alongside Shadow Foreign Affairs Minister Michaelia Cash.\"The Venezuelan people deserve the chance to restore their sovereignty through a peaceful return to democracy.Israel&#x27;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump in a post on X.\"Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump for your bold and historic leadership on behalf of freedom and justice,\" Netanyahu wrote.\"I salute your decisive resolve and the brilliant action of your brave soldiers.\"President of Argentina Javier Milei opted for a similarly celebratory response.\"What we have to understand is that it&#x27;s the collapse of the regime of a dictator that was rigging elections, that in the last election was badly defeated and, despite that, he clung on to power,\" he told reporters.\"That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d say that today&#x27;s news is excellent news for the free world.\"&#x27; This is deeply concerning and condemnable&#x27;Other foreign governments swiftly responded with strong criticism of the US&#x27; military action. Spa in, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay expressed \"deep concern\" for the military response in Venezuela in a joint statement.The five countries said it rejected the operations which were conducted in violation of international law.\"Such actions set an extremely dangerous precedent for regional peace and security and for the rules-based international order, in addition to endangering the civilian population,\" the statement read.\"We reiterate that the situation in Venezuela must be resolved exclusively by peaceful means, through dialogue, negotiation, and respect for the will of the Venezuelan people in all its expressions, without external interference and in accordance with international law.\"Brazil&#x27;s President Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva posted his own statement on X and claimed the strikes and Maduro&#x27;s capture crosses an unacceptable line.\"T hese acts represent a grave affront to Venezuela&#x27;s sovereignty and yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community.\" he said.\"Attacking countries in flagrant violation of international law is the first step toward a world of violence, chaos, and instability, where the law of the strongest prevails over multilateralism.\" The Mexican Ministry for Foreign Affairs initially said it \"strongly condemns and rejects the military actions carried out unilaterally in recent hours by the armed forces of the United States of America against targets in the territory of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, in clear violation of Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations\".Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said that while Spain did not recognise Maduro&#x27;s regime, his government also does not recognise an intervention that is a violation of international law and of which \" pushes the region toward a horizon of uncertainty and belligerence\".READ MORE: Operation Absolute Resolve: The US mission to capture Maduro\"We call on all actors to think of the civilian population, to respect the United Nations Charter, and to articulate a fair and dialogued transition,\" Sanchez said.Russia&#x27;s foreign ministry condemned the action as an \"act of armed aggression\". \"The pretexts used to justify such actions are unfounded. Ideological animosity has prevailed over business pragmatism and the willingness to build relationships based on trust and predictability,\" the ministry said in a statement.\"In the current situation, it is important, first and foremost, to prevent further escalation and to focus on finding a way out of the situation through dialogue.\"China&#x27;s foreign ministry said in a statement that it was \"deeply shocked\". \"China is deeply shocked and strongly condemns the use of force by the US against a sovereign country and the use of force against the president of a country,\" a ministry statement said.Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres echoed the sentiment that the US operation sets a dangerous precedent.\"The Secretary-General continues to emphasise the importance of full respect - by all - of international law, including the UN Charter,\" a spokesperson for Guterres said. \"He&#x27;s deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected.\"Pope Leo called for the \"sovereignty\" of Venezuela to be guaranteed, saying he&#x27;s following developments in the Latin American country with \"deep concern\".READ MORE: What to know about the Swiss Alpine bar fire that killed 40 The US-born pope, speaking at the Sunday Angelus, said, \"the good of the beloved Venezuelan people must prevail over every other consideration\" while calling for a journey of \"justice and peace guaranteeing the sovereignty of the country, ensuring the rule of law written in the Constitution and respecting human and civil rights of all and working together to build a peaceful future of collaboration, stability and harmony\".The pope also appealed for \"the poorest who suffer because of the difficult economic situation\" in the country whose economy is 28 per cent of what it was in 2013, according to the IMF.In early December, Leo, warned against a US military incursion in Venezuela.
