A 15-year-old boy was also in the home at the time.READ MORE: Police descend on home amid search for alleged cop killer Tran&#x27;s remains were found in the torched SUV in Beverly Hills.Police believe Tran and the children were likely targeted as a result of her husband&#x27;s alleged involvement with a criminal drug crime network based in Victoria. He has not been charged over his alleged involvement in the criminal group.Police raided a unit in Bankstown yesterday and arrested a 29-year-old man.He was charged with murder and was refused bail to appear before Bankstown Local Court today.Police will allege in court the man facilitated Tran&#x27;s kidnapping and murder and was involved in the assault of the eight-year-old boy.The man who was arrested is not alleged to have killed Tran himself, but is alleged to have brought the three men who did to her home and facilitated the murder.Evidence suggested Tran was shot before the SUV was set alight with her body in it, NSW Police homicide squad commander Joe Doueihi said today. Investigations under Strike Force Bushfield are ongoing and detectives are still working to track down the three men alleged to have kidnapped and killed Tran.The eight-year-old boy has made a good recovery from the serious head injuries he sustained in the attack, Doueihi said.A relative of Tran&#x27;s took to social media at the time of her death, calling on the government for justice to be served.The family member posted an Instagram comment asking \"the local government [to] return justice to [Tran].Another friend, who didn&#x27;t want to be named, told the Sydney Morning Herald what happened was \"so awful\".\"She didn&#x27;t deserve this. She was a loving mother. Everyone is in shock,\" they said.",
