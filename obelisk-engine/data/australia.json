          "content": "The man who attempted to assassinate Donald Trump at a Florida golf course last year tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen shortly after being found guilty of all counts overnight.Officers quickly swarmed him and dragged him out of the courthouse.The jury of five men and seven women found Ryan Routh guilty on all counts that he was facing after two hours of deliberation.READ MORE: More than 160,000 apply for Florida&#x27;s first bear hunt in a decade After the jurors were on their way out of the courtroom, Routh grabbed a pen and started trying to stab himself in the neck. Marshals swarmed him and picked him up and dragged him out of the courthouse.His daughter Sara Routh was screaming, \"Dad I love you don&#x27;t do anything. I&#x27;ll get you out. He didn&#x27;t hurt anybody.\"She continued screaming inside the courtroom as her father was dragged out. She said the case against him was rigged. The daughter went outside the courthouse and was waiting by the guard gate for her father to be driven out and transported to prison.READ MORE: Where &#x27;day-zero droughts&#x27; could happen as soon as this decade Routh had been charged with attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, assaulting a federal officer, possessing a firearm and ammunition as a convicted felon and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. He had pleaded not guilty to the charges and defended himself in court.Prosecutors said Routh spent weeks plotting to kill Trump before aiming a rifle through shrubbery as the Republican played golf on September 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club.Routh told jurors in his closing argument that he didn&#x27;t intend to kill anyone that day.READ MORE: &#x27;Rewards would be too great&#x27;: Trump hits out at recognition of Palestine \"It&#x27;s hard for me to believe that a crime occurred if the trigger was never pulled,\" Routh said. He pointed out that he could see Trump as he was on the path toward the sixth-hole green at the golf course and noted that he also could have shot a Secret Service agent who confronted him if he had intended to harm anyone.Routh, 59, exercised his constitutional right not to testify in his own defence. He rested his case Monday morning after questioning just three witnesses – a firearms expert and two character witnesses – for a total of about three hours. In contrast, prosecutors spent seven days questioning 38 witnesses.Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X that the guilty verdict \"illustrates the Department of Justice&#x27;s commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence.\"\"This attempted assassination was not only an attack on our President, but an affront to our very nation,\" Bondi said.US District Judge Aileen Cannon signed off on Routh&#x27;s request to represent himself following two hearings in July. The US Supreme Court has held that criminal defendants have a right to represent themselves in court proceedings, as long as they can show a judge they are competent to waive their right to be defended by an attorney.Routh&#x27;s former defence attorneys have served as standby counsel since he took over his own defence and have been present during trial the past two weeks.Recounting what happened at the golf course, a Secret Service agent testified earlier in the trial that he spotted Routh before Trump came into view. Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot, the agent said.Law enforcement obtained help from a witness who testified that he saw a person fleeing the area after hearing gunshots. The witness was then flown in a police helicopter to a nearby interstate where Routh was arrested, and the witness said he confirmed it was the person he had seen.Just nine weeks earlier, Trump had survived an attempt on his life while campaigning in Butler, Pennsylvania. That gunman had fired eight shots, with one bullet grazing Trump&#x27;s ear. The gunman was then fatally shot by a Secret Service counter sniper.Routh was a North Carolina construction worker who in recent years had moved to Hawaii. A self-styled mercenary leader, Routh spoke out to anyone who would listen about his dangerous and sometimes violent plans to insert himself into conflicts around the world, witnesses have told The Associated Press.In the early days of Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine, Routh tried to recruit soldiers from Afghanistan, Moldova and Taiwan to fight the Russians.In his native Greensboro, North Carolina, he was arrested in 2002 for eluding a traffic stop and barricading himself from officers with a fully automatic machine gun and a \"weapon of mass destruction,\" which turned out to be an explosive with a 10-inch (25-centimetre) fuse, police said.In 2010, police searched a warehouse Routh owned and found more than 100 stolen items, from power tools and building supplies to kayaks and spa tubs. In both felony cases, judges gave Routh either probation or a suspended sentence.Besides the federal charges, Routh also has pleaded not guilty to state charges of terrorism and attempted murder.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
