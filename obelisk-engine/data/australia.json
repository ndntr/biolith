          "content": "A gunman opened fire inside a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Michigan during a Sunday service and set the building ablaze, killing at least four people and injuring eight others before police shot him, authorities said.Hundreds of people were inside The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township when a 40-year-old man rammed a ute through the front door, then got out of the vehicle and started shooting, Police Chief William Renye told reporters.Police believe he \"deliberately\" set the building on fire.READ MORE: The events that have led to the UN retaliating against IranAfter the suspect left the church, two officers pursued him and \"engaged in gunfire,\" Renye said. The man was killed.Flames and smoke could be seen pouring from the church for hours before the blaze was put out. First responders were then sifting through the wreckage.\"We do believe we will find some additional victims once we find the area where the fire was,\" Renye said.He said as well as two victims killed by gunfire, two other bodies had been found in the ruins of the burned church.According to CNN, a law enforcement source said seven people remain unaccounted for, but cautioned that number could include survivors who had not yet contacted their families. The search through the wreckage of the church has been called off for the night and will resume tomorrow. The FBI is leading the investigation into the attack as an \"act of targeted violence\", according to Reuben Coleman, the Acting Special Agent in Charge of FBI Detroit Field Office.\"This act of violence has no place in our state or anywhere else in our country,\" he said.\"The FBI is committed to continue finding out the facts, circumstances and motives behind this tragedy.\"READ MORE: Trump authorises &#x27;full force if necessary&#x27; while sending troops to PortlandWho is Thomas Jacob Sanford? Renye identified the suspect as Thomas Jacob Sanford, 40, from neighbouring Burton. Reyne did not specify a motive at a news conference on Sunday evening. Police cordoned off the street leading to the suspect&#x27;s home.Sanford was an Iraq War veteran and outdoorsman, according to military records and social media posts.A Marine Corps spokesperson told CNN that Sanford served as a sergeant and received several medals for his service, which lasted from 2004 to 2008. He was deployed during Operation Iraqi Freedom for several months starting in the summer of 2007.Sanford graduated from Goodrich High School in 2004 and was recognised among other veteran alumni, according to an archived page from the school&#x27;s website. A local news profile of Sanford from 2007 said he was deployed with the US Marine Corps to Japan before preparing to head for service in Iraq.Social media accounts linked to Sanford&#x27;s family show he was married with at least one child, a young son. According to a GoFundMe page from 2015, the family was in need of donations to help pay for the medical care of Sanford&#x27;s son, who was born with a rare genetic disorder.The newborn was diagnosed with a condition called congenital hyperinsulinism, which required a lengthy hospital stay and several surgeries to remove portions of the pancreas, according to a family Facebook page documenting the difficult journey.The child&#x27;s medical condition took a financial toll on the family, with one local news article reporting Sanford took leave from his work as a truck driver for Coca-Cola to be with his son.\"Don&#x27;t ever take having healthy kids for granted,\" Sanford is quoted as saying in another article.\"We are proud of our child. I spent four years in the Marine Corps and was in Iraq and this is still the most unique thing to deal with.\"Other posts on Sanford&#x27;s mother&#x27;s Facebook page show that Sanford was a hunter, posing with deer and other game.No motive known Renye said one of the wounded people was in critical condition Sunday evening and seven others were stable.Police said they did not yet have a motive for the fire or shooting. Investigators are searching the suspect&#x27;s residence in nearby Burton. Authorities did not provide any additional details about the suspect, including whether he was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, widely known as the Mormon church.It was the latest of many shooting attacks on houses of worship in the US over the past 20 years, including one in August that killed two children during Mass at the Church of the Annunciation in Minneapolis.US President Donald Trump said he was briefed on the shooting. In a social media post, he applauded the FBI, who local authorities said are sending 100 agents to the area, for responding.READ MORE: Egyptian wrestler pulls 700-ton ship with his teeth \"PRAY for the victims, and their families. THIS EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE IN OUR COUNTRY MUST END, IMMEDIATELY!\" Trump wrote.The church building, circled by a parking lot and a large lawn, is near residential areas and a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness church. It is in Grand Blanc Township, a community of roughly 40,000 people outside Flint.The impact spread quickly to neighbouring communities, including the small city that shares a name with the township.\"Although we are two separate governmental units, we are a very cohesive community,\" said city of Grand Blanc Mayor John Creasey.\"This sort of thing is painful for our entire community. I&#x27;m struggling to digest all that has happened, and my heart goes out to all of the affected families.\"Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement that her heart was breaking for the community. \"Violence anywhere especially in a place of worship, is unacceptable,\" she said.The shooting occurred the morning after Russell M Nelson, the oldest-ever president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, died at 101. The next president of the faith is expected to be Dallin H Oaks, per church protocol.\"The church is in communication with local law enforcement as the investigation continues and as we receive updates on the condition of those affected,\" Doug Anderson, a spokesperson for Utah-based faith said in a statement.\"Places of worship are meant to be sanctuaries of peacemaking, prayer and connection. We pray for peace and healing for all involved.\"Some striking nurses at nearby Henry Ford Hospital left the picket line and ran the short distance to the church to help first responders, Teamsters Local 332 President Dan Glass said.\"Human lives matter more than our labour dispute.\" Glass said.
