          "content": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan have announced an additional $158 million will go towards communities impacted by Victorian bushfires.Addressing the media from Victoria&#x27;s State Control Centre, Albanese announced the funds will bring the total Commonwealth‑State Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements for the fires to $329 million.\"This includes funds for clean-up programs, for emergency recovery support programs, to support businesses, to support local government across a range of areas,\" Albanese said.READ MORE: Man arrested for allegedly impersonating FBI agent in foiled attempt to free Luigi Mangione\"In addition to that, money to help repair public land and waterways, money for recovery water tanks rebates, funding across the board where it&#x27;s needed.\"We want to make sure that people know the government will be there at difficult times.\"It is the second major funding announcement from the Prime Minister today, after Albanese struck a $25 billion deal to help fund public hospitals across the country.The announcement marks an expansion of a joint $171 million disaster recovery payment support package announced for fire-impacted communities earlier this month.Allan said the first funding stage addressed \"immediate relief\" measures including hardship payments, fodder, prolonged power outages and emergency accommodation funding.Today&#x27;s announcement would focus on the next phase of the fire recovery, Allan said.\"A significant component of this funding is focused on the clean-up, and a lead contractor has been appointed and will work with those communities on the clean-up,\" she said.Ongoing and additional mental health support and temporary accommodation would also be allocated from today&#x27;s package expansion. The Allan government will inject an extra $2 million for mental health services at schools within fire-affected areas. The Harcourt Cooperative Cool Store will receive a $500,000 cash splash to rebuild after fire tore through the facility.More than 95 businesses in Harcourt and the surrounding region relied on the facility to keep apples, pears, seed potatoes, wine, craft beer and beehives at temperature before it succumbed to fire.Affected individuals can call the Emergency Recovery Hotline on 1800 560 760READ MORE: Alleged Lone Wolf bikie associate one of two charged over woman&#x27;s kidnappingVictorian fire s claim more than 1550 structuresMore than 400,000 hectares of land has been scorched by bushfires over the last month alone.The fires have razed more than 1550 structures, Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch said.More than 400 homes have been destroyed, including 320 houses flattened and 19 severely damaged in the Longwood fire. Crews were able to bring the Lake Barracoota, Rich River, Rocklands and Larralea blazes under control yesterday.\"In good news, we&#x27;ve gone from eight major fires now to four major fires that are still active at this time,\" Wiebusch said.That means the Longwood, Walwa , Carlisle River and Dargo/Wonnangatta fires are the only fires that continue to burn.READ MORE: Man who squirted vinegar on politician is charged with assaulting and intimidating herThe Longwood fire is now contained and hasn&#x27;t moved in recent days thanks to firefighter efforts.\"Both of [the Wonnangatta and Carlisle River] fires really won&#x27;t be safe until we see decent rain, and there&#x27;s no forecast rain in the near future,\" Wiebusch said.\"Both of those fires have remained in containment lines in recebt days and we&#x27;re hoping come early next week those fires may be deemed in fact contained.\"Four watch and acts warnings remain in place across the state, where it&#x27;s still deemed too unsafe to return to several communities in the Walwa and Carlisle River fire zones.Residents in Gellibrand, Lovat and sections of Carlisle River are unable to return to their properties due to fire danger from Carlisle River blaze, after they were evacuated on Tuesday.\"We are hopeful that over the weekend we will be able to get residents back into the Gellibrand communities,\" Wiebusch said.The Carlisle River blaze has destroyed nine homes and significantly damaged two others. Twenty-five outbuildings were also lost to the blaze. The Gellibrand community still doesn&#x27;t have access to safe drinking water after the fire \"badly impacted\" the town&#x27;s water treatment plant.Barwon Water has restored some water to Gellibrand for toilets and showers, and a potable water station has been set up .Walwa fire faces next test Three watch and act warnings remain in place over the Walwa fire zone. Those in Berringama, parts of Bullioh, Koetong, Lucyvale and Shelley, Bucheen Creek, Cravensville and parts of the southern end of the Nariel Valley and surrounds can&#x27;t go back to their properties near the Walwa bushfire either. READ MORE: Urgent safety warning issued over counterfeit melatonin sleep supplementsThe Walwa fire is expected to \"come under pressure\" in the next 24 hours with the arrival of increased winds and 40 degree temperatures, but crews hope to also bring that blaze under control early next week.Fourteen homes have been destroyed by the Walwa fire and two have been significantly damaged, in addition to 93 damaged or destroyed structures. Warnings have been reduced in areas surrounding the fire activity zones in recent days.A state of disaster remains in place across Victoria and the landscape remains very dry, Wiebusch said.Dry lightning forecast across Victoria on Saturday and early Sunday could pose a risk. \"We need the community to remain vigilant, if you do see flames or new fires start then please ring through to Triple Zero so we can get our fire crews onto them as soon as we can,\" Wiebusch said.
