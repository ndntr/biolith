To induce protests. To induce conflicts. His goal is to make Portland look as he was describing it as,\" Merkley said.\"Our job is to say, &#x27;We are not going to take the bait.&#x27;\"Wilson in a statement Saturday said there is no need to send troops, adding the president \"will not find lawlessness or violence here unless he plans to perpetrate it.\"\"Imagine if the federal government sent hundreds of engineers, or teachers, or outreach workers to Portland, instead of a short, expensive, and fruitless show of force,\" the mayor wrote.Oregon Governor Tina Kotek wrote on social media Saturday her office had not been notified why the troops were being deployed.\"My office is reaching out to the White House and Homeland Security for more information. We have been provided no information on the reason or purpose of any military mission,\" Kotek wrote.\"There is no national security threat in Portland.

They&#x27;re professional agitators and anarchists,\" Trump said.Trump earlier this month designated Antifa – the loose factions of black-clad leftists or anarchists who show up at protests opposing the police or government – as a \"major terrorist organization.\"The White House has emphasised incidents in Portland, home to one of the oldest organizations in the country to carry the Antifa moniker, in its statements about the designation.Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officials were deployed to downtown Portland in 2020, during Trump&#x27;s first term, due to protests after the murder of George Floyd.\"I&#x27;m going to look at it now, because I didn&#x27;t know that was still going on. This has been going on for years,\" Trump said earlier this month.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "As new tensions rise between Russia and NATO powers, Moscow&#x27;s top diplomat insisted to world leaders that his nation doesn&#x27;t intend to attack Europe but will mount a “decisive response” to any aggression.Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke at the UN General Assembly after weeks in which unauthorised flights into NATO’s airspace — intrusions the alliance blames on Russia — have raised alarm around Europe, particularly after NATO jets downed drones over Poland and Estonia said Russian fighter jets flew into its territory and lingered for 12 minutes.Russia has denied that its planes entered Estonian airspace and has said the drones didn’t target Poland, with Moscow’s ally Belarus maintaining that Ukrainian signal-jamming sent the devices off course.READ MORE: Trump sending in troops to protect &#x27;under siege&#x27; facilitiesBut European leaders see the incidents as intentional, provocative moves meant to rattle NATO and to assess how the alliance will respond. The alliance warned Russia this week that NATO would use all means to defend against any further breaches of its airspace.At the UN, Lavrov maintained it’s Russia that’s facing threats.“Russia has never had and does not have any such intentions” of attacking European or NATO countries, he said. “However, any aggression against my country will be met with a decisive response. There should be no doubt about this among those in NATO and the EU.\"Speaking three years into the Ukraine warLavrov spoke three years into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a war that the international community has broadly deplored.US President Donald Trump said this week that he believed Ukraine can win back all the territory it has lost to Russia. It was a notable tone shift from a US leader who had previously suggested Ukraine would need to make some concessions and could never reclaim all the areas Russia has occupied since seizing the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and launching a full-scale invasion in 2022.At a news conference after his speech, Lavrov said Moscow appreciates President Donald Trump&#x27;s proposal that led to rekindling a dialogue between the two countries.When U.S. and Russian interests don&#x27;t coincide, he said, “the most important thing is not to let it result in confrontation or collision, especially a hot confrontation, and we&#x27;re united in this position, in diplomacy.”He said some unnamed European countries have turned diplomacy “into kissing up to their friends from Washington,” so he believes the US will continue to support Ukraine and substitute diplomacy with sanctions.READ MORE: Three teens arrested after allegedly stealing car, injuring woman on Gold Coast“This is a path without any promise. It won&#x27;t succeed,\" Russia&#x27;s top diplomat said. “However, frank dialogue on any matters — well, we&#x27;ll see that the US is prepared for that, and we&#x27;re also prepared to conduct it.”Just three weeks earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country and the US had a “mutual understanding” and that Trump&#x27;s administration \"is listening to us.” Trump and Putin held a summit in Alaska in early August but left without a deal to end the war.Sounding a notably open note on the UN. stage from a country that has often lambasted the West, Lavrov pointed to the summit and said Russia had “some hopes” to keep talking with the United States.“In the approaches of the current U.S. administration, we see a desire not only to contribute to ways to realistically resolve the Ukrainian crisis, but also a desire to develop pragmatic cooperation without adopting an ideological stance,” the diplomat said, portraying the powers as counterparts of sorts: “Russia and the U.S. bear a special responsibility for the state of affairs in the world, and for avoiding risks that could plunge humanity into a new war.”To be sure, Lavrov still had sharp words for NATO, an alliance that includes the U.S., and for the West in general and the European Union.Trump&#x27;s emerging view of Ukraine is part of the equationTrump&#x27;s new view of Ukraine&#x27;s prospects came after he met with its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on the sidelines of General Assembly on Tuesday — seven months after a televised blow-up between the two in the Oval Office. This time, the doors were closed, and the tenor was evidently different —\"a good meeting,” as Zelenskyy described it in his assembly speech the next day.For the fourth year in a row, Zelenskyy appealed to the gathering of presidents, prime ministers and other top officials to get Russia out of his country — and warned that inaction would put other countries at risk.“Ukraine is only the first,\" he said.Russia has offered various explanations for the Ukraine war, among them ensuring Russia&#x27;s own security after NATO expanded eastward over the years and drew closer with Ukraine after Russia&#x27;s move into Crimea. Russia also said its offensive was meant to protect Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine.Ukraine and the West have denounced Russia&#x27;s invasion as an unprovoked act of aggression.Addressing the devastating war in Gaza, Lavrov condemned Hamas militants&#x27; surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, but said “there is no justification” for Israel’s killing of Palestinian civilians, including children.READ MORE: Albanese joins UK PM in far right warnings as he takes Aussie beers to No.10The Hamas attack killed about 1200 people in Israel; 251 were taken hostage. Israel’s sweeping offensive has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not give a breakdown of civilian and combatant deaths but says around half of those killed were women and children.Lavrov also said there is no basis for any potential Israeli annexation of the West Bank, which Palestinians consider a key part of their future state, along with Gaza and east Jerusalem.Israel hasn’t announced such a move, but several leading members in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government have advocated doing so. Officials recently approved a controversial settlement project that would effectively cut the West Bank in two, a move critics say could doom chances for a Palestinian state.Between the Gaza war and the situation in the West Bank, “we are essentially dealing with an attempt at a kind of coup d’etat aimed at burying UN decisions on the creation of a Palestinian state,” Lavrov said.The international community has long embraced a “two-state solution\" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But Netanyahu rejects the idea of a Palestinian state, saying it would reward Hamas — a position he reiterated at the General Assembly.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
