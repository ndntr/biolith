          "content": "A 7.6-magnitude earthquake off the southern Philippines has damaged buildings, knocked out power, killed at least one person and prompted evacuations of coastal areas nearby due to a possible tsunami.President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said the potential damage was being assessed and rescue teams and relief operations were being prepared and would be deployed when it was safe to do so.The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said it was expecting damage and aftershocks from the earthquake, which was centred at sea about 62 kilometres south-east of Manay town in Davao Oriental province and was caused by movement in the Philippine Trench at a depth of 23 kilometres.READ MORE: Severe weather warnings issued in five states as destructive winds surgeAt least one person died after being hit by falling debris in the south, Office of Civil Defence deputy administrator Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV said in a news briefing without providing details.Several buildings sustained cracks in their walls, including an international airport in Davao city, but it remained operational without any flights being cancelled, Alejandro said.\"I was driving my car when it suddenly swayed and I saw powerlines swaying wildly. People darted out of houses and buildings as the ground shook and electricity came off,\" Jun Saavedra, a disaster-mitigation officer of Governor Generoso town in Davao Oriental, told The Associated Press.READ MORE: Tighter Chinese curbs on rare earth exports could open door for Australia \"We&#x27;ve had earthquakes in the past, but this was the strongest,\" Saavedra said, adding that the intense ground swaying caused cracks in several buildings, including schools.At least 50 students from a high school in his town were brought to a hospital by ambulance after sustaining bruises, fainting or becoming dizzy due to the earthquake, Saavedra said.Governor Generoso is a town about 100 kilometres south of Manay, where classes in all levels were also suspended.Children evacuated schools in Davao City, which has about 5.4 million people and is the biggest city near the epicentre, about 250 kilometres west of Davao Oriental province.The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre in Honolulu said small waves were detected on the coasts of the Philippines and Indonesia before the threat passed about two hours after the quake. It said small sea fluctuations may continue.READ MORE: RBA boss denies housing crisis accusation in tense stand-off Alejandro warned that tsunami waves could hit six nearby coastal provinces from Davao Oriental up to two hours after the earthquake struck at 9.43am (12.43pm AEDT).\"We urge these coastal communities to be on alert and immediately evacuate to higher grounds until further notice,\" Alejandro said in a video news briefing.Indonesia&#x27;s Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics Agency said small tsunami waves were detected in North Sulawesi province with heights ranging from 3.5-17 centimetres in Melonguane, Beo, Essang and Ganalo in the Talaud Islands districts.The Philippines is still recovering from the September 30 earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9 that left at least 74 people dead and displaced thousands of people in the central province of Cebu, particularly Bogo city and outlying towns.One of the world&#x27;s most disaster-prone countries, the Philippines is often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions because of its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of seismic faults around the ocean.The archipelago is also lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms each year, making disaster response a major task of the government and volunteer groups.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "RBA Governor Michele Bullock has hit back at suggestions from the Greens that the central bank is responsible for Australia&#x27;s skyrocketing house prices in a tense parliamentary hearing.In an appearance at Senate estimates this morning, Bullock was questioned by Greens senator Nick McKim about the Reserve Bank&#x27;s role in the housing crisis.\"The $400 billion that the RBA printed in the early year or two of COVID and effectively handed over to retail banks, who then turn around and lend it into the property market, do you accept that that played a role in the housing price bubble that we&#x27;ve seen over the last five years?\" McKim asked.READ MORE: Man arrested after woman&#x27;s death at Melbourne home \"Certainly part of the way monetary policy works is through the housing market, but I would not accept that the Reserve Bank is responsible for the housing price issues in this country,\" Bullock, who wasn&#x27;t appointed as governor until 2023, replied.When challenged on that by McKim, who put to her that the RBA \"doesn&#x27;t accept any responsibility whatsoever in the housing price spike\", Bullock pointed to an oft-cited factor as the genuine culprit.\"The problem is the lack of supply relative to demand, and when monetary policy eases and housing demand picks up, supply can&#x27;t pick up as quickly, and that&#x27;s where you end up,\" she said. \"But it&#x27;s not monetary policy&#x27;s responsibility to look after housing prices.\"READ MORE: Unusual customer heads to South Australia bottle shop&#x27;s beer fridge Having previously said that it would be at least two years before Australia started to see some relief from price surges, despite governments starting to focus on increasing supply, Bullock reiterated that fixing the country&#x27;s housing stock was a long, slow process.\"It takes time to get approvals and one of the big things is higher density housing and that by its nature takes much longer,\" she said.\"It is not something that you can just turn the switch and say &#x27;alright, now we&#x27;re off and running&#x27;, it really takes time.\"Bullock also frustrated McKim by telling him investors weren&#x27;t significantly exacerbating the housing crisis at the moment, and by refusing to be drawn on whether removing the capital gains tax discount for property would slow price rises.READ MORE: Pure chance saved fourth officer from being shot by Dezi Freeman: police \"I have done no particular analysis on what removal of the capital gains tax might do,\" she said.\"It&#x27;s (not) my job to tell the government what they should do with the policy,\" she added. However, when asked by Liberal senator Andrew Bragg about the impact of the federal government&#x27;s expanded first home guarantee scheme, Bullock said it was possible it would lead to house prices going \"a little higher\" in the short-term.But as for the medium-term impacts, she said that would depend on – you guessed it – supply.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
