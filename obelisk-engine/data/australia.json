I won&#x27;t do it,\" Griffiths replied, before placing the lighter near the ground and setting Sheahan alight.Flames spread to his 16-year-old stepdaughter and to Griffiths, who extinguished the fire on himself before helping his wife.Sheahan was dragged to the bathroom, given a cold shower and then Griffiths took her outside and sprayed his wife with a hose.READ MORE: Melbourne youth gang members on notice after police warningThe children who were trapped inside the house, including a 10-month-old and a two-year-old, were rescued by their older siblings before the entire home caught fire.Emergency services heard Griffiths blaming Sheahan for the fire and telling her: \"Why didn&#x27;t you stop me, you should&#x27;ve stopped me and I should be in jail\".The woman, who was in the early stages of dying, lied to police for him, saying Griffiths tried to light himself on fire and when she tried to stop him she caught fire too.Sheahan was taken to hospital with burns to 91 per cent of her body, but she died on March 18, 2022, four days after the blaze.The day Griffiths was supposed to face trial, in February 2025, he indicated he wanted to plead guilty to murder and recklessly causing injury to his stepchild.Justice John Champion labelled the murder a brutal example of the offence and pointed out his taunting of his victims who must have been \"terrified\".He noted Griffiths&#x27; victim blaming of Sheahan after the offending was \"particularly repugnant\".\"I make it clear that Ms Sheahan was completely blameless, innocent and did not deserve the treatment you meted out to her at all,\" the judge said.\"Your attack on Ms Sheahan was grievously inappropriate.\"Justice Champion jailed Griffiths for life, with 32 years to serve before he is eligible for parole.Griffiths has spent more than 1300 days in custody as he has been in jail since his arrest in March 2022.National Sexual Assault, Domestic Family Violence Counselling Service 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732).",

          "content": "I nternational biosecurity measures are tightening in Asian airports after the deadly Nipah virus was detected in India.Two people in the country have contracted the illness, which has a high mortality rate.So far, a range of nearly 200 of their contacts have been asymptomatic.READ MORE: Congresswoman attacked &#x27;probably&#x27; set up the assault, claims Trump Nonetheless, Hong Kong has announced it will be screening all passengers from India for the time being, as the investigation into the cases continues.So what is the Nipah virus that has everybody so worried? Here&#x27;s what you need to know.What is the Nipah virus?The Nipah virus, first recorded in 1999 in Malaysia, is a virus natively found in bats that can be transferred to other animals and humans.It can also be transferred to humans via food, including fruit. It is also known to transfer from bats to pigs, and has caused wide agricultural damage in its occasional breakouts.It&#x27;s closely related to the Hendra virus, which is more widely-known in Australia.READ MORE: Agents involved in Alex Pretti shooting placed on administrative leaveWhat happens to humans who get it?The fatality rate in humans is estimated at 40 to 75 per cent, the World Health Organisation says.That&#x27;s a wide variation, but the WHO said it was due to the differences in medical resouces between stricken areas.Symptoms in humans include fever, headache, dizziness, vomiting, reduced consciousness, and respiratory distress. READ MORE: Residents in fear after teens invited to mass bike rideoutAs well as acute, potentially deadly respiratory illness, the disease also kills through encephalitis, which can develop in as little as 24 hours in severe cases.Survivors can also be left with brain damage. Is there a cure?There is no known treatment and no vaccine for the Nipah virus. Researchers in Queensland recently announced in July last year they had detected the first ever antibody to work effectively against Nipah and Hendra.The antibody is able to prevent the virus mutating, which was one of the chief reasons treatments failed against it.But as of yet, that has not been approved for clinical use.Where is the nipah virus found?Not in Australia.The Nipah virus is chiefly found in south-east Asian countries including Malaysia, Bangladesh, and Singapore, though signs of the virus in bats have also been found in Indonesia and as far flung as Ghana.The Department of Agriculture has identified a risk that migrating fruit bats could bring the disease to Australia but so far the country is nipah-free.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
