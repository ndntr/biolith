READ MORE: Macron forced to walk NYC streets as Trump motorcade blocks trafficIf you don&#x27;t have the time to sit through the entire speech, fret not. Here is a compilation of some of the president&#x27;s most notable lines. &#x27;Whoever&#x27;s operating this teleprompter is in big trouble&#x27;Trump&#x27;s speech was off to a rocky start due to some temporary teleprompter issues.He didn&#x27;t seem to mind and said this was an opportunity to \"speak more from the heart\".\"I don&#x27;t mind making this speech without a teleprompter because the teleprompter is not working,\" he said.\"I feel very happy to be up here with you, nevertheless, and that way, you speak more from the heart. I can only say that whoever&#x27;s operating this teleprompter is in big trouble.\" The teleprompter was ultimately fixed.&#x27;We&#x27;re the hottest country&#x27; This is a line that we heard quite a bit during his address.\"Just eight months into my administration, we&#x27;re the hottest country anywhere in the world, and there is no other country even close,\" he said. Trump was unabashedly boastful, patting himself on the back for building the \" greatest economy in the history of the world\".\"We had the best economy ever, history of the world. And I&#x27;m doing the same thing again, but this time it&#x27;s actually much bigger and even better. The numbers far surpass my record-setting first term,\" he said. The president spoke about a \"prosperous\" world during his first term, which descended into \"weakness, lawlessness and radicalisation\" under the former Biden administration.READ MORE: Popular beef mince recalled over plastic found in packets&#x27;I want to thank the country of El Salvador&#x27; The president threw in a shoutout to El Salvador for taking in people the US has deported, including people who are not from El Salvador and who do not appear to be criminals.They have been held in a contro versial prison - the Centre for Terrorism Confinement.\"I want to thank the country of El Salvador for the successful and professional job they&#x27;ve done in receiving and jailing so many criminals that entered our country,\" he said.\"On the world stage, America is respected again like it has never been respected before. You think about two years ago, three years ago, four years ago, or one year ago, we were a laughingstock all over the world.\" &#x27;I have ended seven unendable wars&#x27;Trump has criticised the UN for its failure to stop global conflicts and leaving it up to him to end several wars.\"In a period of just seven months, I have ended seven unendable wars,\" he said.\"It&#x27;s too bad that I had to do these things instead of the United Nations doing them, and sadly, in all cases, the United Nations did not even try to help in any of them.\"I ended seven wars, dealt with the leaders of each and every one of these countries and never even received a phone call from the United Nations offering to help in finalising the deal.\"Trump does get credit for hosting peace talks between Armenia and Azerbaijan after nearly four decades of war.The conflict in Congo and Rwanda continues, however, despite Trump&#x27;s peace effort.India has rejected the idea that Trump ended its short-lived conflict with Pakistan.The ceasefire between Iran and Israel was also negotiated by Qatar and came only after Israel violated Trump&#x27;s previous ceasefire announcement.Neither Kosovo and Serbia nor Ethiopia and Egypt were technically at war during Trump&#x27;s term.READ MORE: Albanese, Trump meeting confirmed for White HouseThis building needs workTrump first criticised the bad teleprompter, and now, he is going after the escalator. \"All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that on the way up, stopped right in the middle,\" Trump said.\"If the first lady wasn&#x27;t in great shape, she would have fallen, but she&#x27;s in great shape. We&#x27;re both in good shape. We both stood.\"These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter.\"Trump appeared to dislike the UN&#x27;s headquarters building. We will learn more on this shortly.&#x27;What is the purpose of the United Nations?&#x27; The mockery of the UN continues.\"What is the purpose of the United Nations? The UN has such tremendous potential. I&#x27;ve always said it. It has such tremendous, tremendous potential, but it&#x27;s not even coming close to living up to that potential, for the most part,\" he said.\"At least for now, all they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up.\"It&#x27;s empty words, and empty words don&#x27;t solve war. The only thing that solves war and wars is action.\"Trump is heralding his own peace efforts.He, however, has failed to stop the war in Gaza and Ukraine he promised to end as a presidential candidate.READ MORE: Trump calls climate change &#x27;the greatest con job ever perpetrated&#x27; on the world&#x27; Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize&#x27;Several world leaders have endorsed the idea of awarding Trump the Nobel Peace Prize over high-profile diplomatic efforts.If he wins, he would be the fifth US president to do so.But in his speech, Trump said he does not care about winning prizes. \"Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize for each one of these achievements,\" he said.\"But for me, the real prize will be the sons and daughters who live to grow up with their mothers and fathers because millions of people are no longer being killed in endless and unglorious wars.\"What I care about is not winning prizes; it&#x27;s saving lives. We save millions and millions of lives with the seven wars. And we have others that we&#x27;re working on. And you know that.\"Seriously, this building And he&#x27;s gone right back to the UN building. He revealed he had actually bid on rebuilding the headquarters, but they went in a different direction. \"Many years ago, a very successful real estate developer in New York, known as Donald J. Trump, I bid on the renovation and rebuilding of this very United Nations complex,\" he said.\"But they decided to go in another direction, which was much more expensive at the time and which actually produced a far inferior product.\"It was going to cost them a fortune. And I said, and wait till you see the overruns. Well, I turned out to be right.\"They had massive cost overruns and spent between 2 and 4 billion dollars on the building and did not even get the marble floors that I promised them. You walk on terrazzo. Do you notice that?\"As far as I&#x27;m concerned, frankly, looking at the building and getting stuck on the escalator, they still haven&#x27;t finished the job.\"The project was so corrupt that Congress actually asked me to testify before them on the tremendous waste of money.\"Unfortunately, many things in the United Nations are happening just like that, but on an even much bigger scale. Much, much bigger. Very sad to see.\"READ MORE: Would-be Trump assassin tries to stab self with pen after verdictThe US is in the minority by not recognising a Palestinian stateTrump spoke about the recognition of Palestinian statehood a day after Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese joined France, the UK, Belgium and several other countries in formally confirming their support. \"As if to encourage continued conflict, some of this body is seeking to unilaterally recognise a Palestinian state,\" he said.\"The rewards would be too great for Hamas&#x27; terrorists for their atrocities… but instead of giving in to Hamas&#x27; ransom demands, those who want peace should be united with one message: Release the hostages now. Just release the hostages now.\"More than 150 of the 193 UN-recognised countries have recognised Palestine as a state.Stop doing business with Russia\"Even NATO countries have not cut off much Russian energy and Russian energy products, which, as you know, I found out about two weeks ago and I wasn&#x27;t happy.

Illegal aliens are pouring into Europe.\"Nobody has ever — and nobody&#x27;s doing anything to change it, to get them out. It&#x27;s not sustainable. And because they choose to be politically correct, they&#x27;re doing just absolutely nothing about it.\"&#x27;Your countries are going to hell&#x27;In arguably one of the most jarring lines in his entire speech, Trump tells the world leaders that their countries are going to hell.\"It&#x27;s time to end the failed experiment of open borders,\" he said.\"You have to end it now. It&#x27;s — I can tell you. I&#x27;m really good at this stuff. Your countries are going to hell.\"&#x27;We will blow you out of existence&#x27; \"We&#x27;ve recently begun using the supreme power of the United States military to destroy Venezuelan terrorists and trafficking networks led by Nicolás Maduro,\" he said, speaking about blowing up boats in the Caribbean.\"To every terrorist thug smuggling poisonous drugs into the United States of America, please be warned that we will blow you out of existence.\"That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re doing.

That&#x27;s what it represents. And it&#x27;s not politically correct, I&#x27;ll be very badly criticised for saying it, but I&#x27;m here to tell the truth,\" he said.\"I don&#x27;t care, it doesn&#x27;t matter to me. I&#x27;m in New York City. I&#x27;m feeling a lot safer.\"It&#x27;s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion. Climate change, no matter what happens, you&#x27;re involved in that. No more global warming, no more global cooling.\"Trump blamed the UN for raising the alarm about climate change. \"All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong,\" he said.\"They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don&#x27;t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.\"He also went on the attack against what he called the \"falsely named renewables\".\" By the way, they&#x27;re a joke. They don&#x27;t work. They&#x27;re too expensive; they&#x27;re not strong enough to fire up the plants that you need to make your country great,\" he said.\"The wind doesn&#x27;t blow. Those big windmills are so pathetic and so bad, so expensive to operate, and they have to be rebuilt all of the time and they start to rust and rot.\"&#x27;I&#x27;ve been right about everything&#x27;Trump said he is \"really good about predicting things\". \"I don&#x27;t say that in a braggadocious way, but it&#x27;s true,\" he said.\"I&#x27;ve been right about everything.

It&#x27;s nonsense,\" he said.\"In the United States, we have, still, radicalised environmentalists, and they want the factories to stop.\"Everything should stop.
