Six-hourly rainfall totals between 40 and 70 millimetres are possible, sparking a severe weather warning for heavy rainfall across places like Echuca, Bendigo, Seymour, Mount Buller, Warragul and the Melbourne metropolitan area.BOM senior meteorologist Angus Hines said flash flooding was possible through the Melbourne metropolitan region.Melbourne&#x27;s western suburbs are particularly in danger of heavy rainfall, according to the Bureau&#x27;s current severe weather warning.Warnings for livestock safety in rural areas have also been issued. Conditions are expected to move through eastern parts of Victoria and potentially south-eastern parts of NSW tomorrow. An initial flood watch is in place for North East, Central and Gippsland catchments.The system is also expected to push into Queensland&#x27;s western Channel Country, affecting Birdsville, Eromanga, Bulloo Downs and the surrounds.There are already a number of flood warnings across the sunshine state due to recent rainfall.More rain and thunderstorms are also forecast today for much of northern and western Queensland, and there are warnings of widespread riverine flooding.The weather system is being driven by a low-pressure system bringing tropical moisture from central Australia, coupled with a cold front from the south.The low is expected to linger until at least the end of the week and possibly into next week, Hines said, though its impact on eastern Australia is expected to shift northward.Sydney will face the possibility of heavy rain from tomorrow afternoon. Emergency services are urging communities to prepare their properties before the storm by tying down loose outdoor items, clearing gutters and downpipes and parking cars undercover or away from trees.Motorists and commuters are warned to drive safely, allow extra travel time and be alert to allow extra travel time and stay alert for hazards. These hazards could include fallen trees, debris, damaged power lines and localised flash flooding.\"If severe weather is impacting your area, consider delaying travel where possible and staying indoors until conditions improve. Never drive through floodwater,\" VICSES chief officer of operations Alistair Drayton said.READ MORE: One award after another for Oscar front-runner at BAFTAsVictoria had a taste of the extreme weather on Sunday, with parts of the state battered by up to 40 millimetres of rain in the 24 hours to 9am yesterday.There was localised flash flooding in the Wodonga area, sparking 90 calls for assistance from VICSES.All up, SES volunteers responded to about 250 requests for assistance across the state between midday on Sunday and 10am yesterday.\"Thank you to the dedicated volunteers who worked throughout last night to assist impacted communities and remain ready to respond as further storms approach this week,\" Drayton said.Communities in areas recently impacted by bushfires have been warned of elevated flash flooding warnings. Burnt ground does not absorb water effectively, meaning runoff can occur quickly and without warning, the State Control Centre said.What was set to be a record-breaking dry summer across swaths of inland Australia has ended dramatically, with a torrential downpour bringing widespread flooding in the final days of summer. Before last weekend, much of inland Australia had not seen any rainfall for two to three months.An area the size of Greenland is on flood watch, from the top of the Northern Territory, into Queensland, NSW and down into agricultural regions of South Australia.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
