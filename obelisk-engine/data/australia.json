          "content": "Five more people have been arrested in the investigation into the theft of crown jewels from the Louvre Museum, but the treasures remain missing, the Paris prosecutor announced on Thursday. The five were detained late on Wednesday night in separate police operations in Paris and surrounding areas, including the Seine-Saint-Denis region, Prosecutor Laure Beccuau told RTL radio. She did not release their identities or other details. One is suspected of being part of the four-person team that robbed the Louvre&#x27;s Apollo Gallery in broad daylight October 19, the prosecutor said. Two other members of the team were arrested on Sunday and given preliminary charges on Wednesday of criminal conspiracy and theft committed by an organized gang. Both partially admitted their involvement, according to the prosecutor.READ MORE: Brutal jail attack that sparked prison officer walkout revealed \"Searches last night and overnight did not allow us to find the goods,\" Beccuau said. It took thieves less than eight minutes to steal the jewels valued at €88 million ($155 million), shocking the world. The robbers forced open a window, cut into cases with power tools and fled with eight pieces of the French crown jewels. French police have acknowledged major gaps in the Louvre&#x27;s defences, turning the dazzling daylight theft into a national reckoning over how France protects its treasures. One of those who has been charged is a 34-year-old Algerian national who has been living in France since 2010, Beccuau said. He was arrested at Charles de Gaulle airport as he was about to fly to Algeria with no return ticket. He was living in a suburb north of Paris, Aubervilliers, and was known to police mostly for road traffic offenses. His DNA was found on one of the scooters used by robbers to leave the scene, she said. The other suspect, 39, was arrested at his home in Aubervilliers. The man was known to police for several thefts, and his DNA was found on one of the glass cases where the jewels were displayed and on items the thieves left behind, she added. Video surveillance cameras showed there were at least four people involved, Beccuau said. Four of the suspects arrived onboard a truck equipped with a freight lift that two of them used to climb up to the museum&#x27;s window. The four of them left onboard two motor scooters along the Seine River toward eastern Paris, where they had some other vehicles parked, she said. Beccuau said nothing suggests that the robbers had accomplices within the museum&#x27;s staff. She made a plea on Wednesday night to those who have the jewels: \"These jewels are now, of course, unsellable … Anyone who buys them would be guilty of concealment of stolen goods. There&#x27;s still time to give them back.\" Information about investigations is meant to be secret under French law to avoid compromising police work and to ensure victims&#x27; right to privacy. Only the prosecutor can speak publicly about developments, and violators can be prosecuted. Police and investigators are not supposed to divulge information about arrests or suspects without the prosecutor&#x27;s approval, though in high-profile cases, police union officials have leaked partial details.",

It&#x27;s his legacy.\"Daniel&#x27;s Law will give Queensland parents access to a list of convicted paedophiles, including child sex offenders released from jail on supervision orders, offenders who have failed to comply with those orders, and those whose whereabouts are unknown. Names and photos will be published along with personal details, like identifying tattoos. \"For too long, monsters have been able to hide in plain sight, living next door, having interaction with kids,\" Queensland premier David Crisafulli said.\"This gives parents another tool to try and keep their kids safe.\"There will also be a locality search, where parents can find out whether high-risk offenders are living near them.A register will also be made available for parents to check whether an individual who has or will have unsupervised contact with their child is a registered child sex offender.The registry won&#x27;t list all pedophiles, but police are confident it will help the public to assist authorities in connecting the dots in what are usually complex cases.\"We can protect our children going forward much better,\" Queensland Police Service Commissioner Steve Gollschewski said\"We&#x27;ll be able to do things now by making those connections that will make a difference to our investigation.\"The register is expected to be up and running by December.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "US President Donald Trump has described his face-to-face with Chinese leader Xi Jinping today as a roaring success, saying he would cut tariffs on China, while Beijing had agreed to allow the export of rare earth elements and start buying American soybeans.The president told reporters aboard Air Force One that the US would lower tariffs implemented earlier this year as punishment on China for its selling of chemicals used to make fentanyl from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.That brings the total combined tariff rate on China down from 57 per cent to 47 per cent.READ MORE: Dad almost killed in freak bed base accident\"I guess on the scale from 0 to 10, with ten being the best, I would say the meeting was a 12,\" Trump said. \"I think it was a 12.\"Trump said that he would go to China in April and Xi would come to the US \"sometime after that\". The president said they also discussed the export of more advanced computer chips to China, saying that Nvidia would be in talks with Chinese officials.Trump said he could sign a trade deal with China \"pretty soon.\"\"We have not too many major stumbling blocks,\" Trump said.READ MORE: Trump makes &#x27;immediate&#x27; nuclear weapons testing order Sources of tension remainDespite Trump&#x27;s optimism after a 100-minute meeting with Xi in South Korea, there continues to be the potential for major tensions between the world&#x27;s two largest economies.Both nations are seeking dominant places in manufacturing, developing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and shaping world affairs like Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine.Trump&#x27;s aggressive use of tariffs since returning to the White House for a second term, combined with China&#x27;s retaliatory limits on exports of rare earth elements, gave the meeting newfound urgency.READ MORE: Renewed search for missing boy Gus to focus on damThere is a mutual recognition that neither side wants to risk blowing up the world economy in ways that could jeopardise their own country&#x27;s fortunes.When the two were seated at the start of the meeting, Xi read prepared remarks that stressed a willingness to work together despite differences.\"Given our different national conditions, we do not always see eye to eye with each other,\" he said through a translator.\"It is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then.\"There was a slight difference in translation as China&#x27;s Xinhua News Agency reported Xi as telling Trump that having some differences is inevitable.China did not provide immediate comment on the meeting or any outcomes.READ MORE: Earth at its hottest temperature in 125,000 years, report finds Finding ways to lower the temperatureThe leaders met in Busan, South Korea, a port city about 76 kilometres south of Gyeongju, the main venue for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.In the days leading up to the meeting, US officials signalled that Trump did not intend to make good on a recent threat to impose an additional 100 per cent import tax on Chinese goods, and China showed signs it was willing to relax its export controls on rare earths and also buy soybeans from America.Officials from both countries met earlier this week in Kuala Lumpur to lay the groundwork for their leaders. Afterwards, China&#x27;s top trade negotiator Li Chenggang said they had reached a \"preliminary consensus,\" a statement affirmed by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said there was \" a very successful framework\".Shortly before the meeting today, Trump posted on Truth Social that the meeting would be the \"G2\", a recognition of America and China&#x27;s status as the world&#x27;s biggest economies.The Group of Seven and Group of 20 are other forums of industrialised nations.But while those summits often happen at luxury spaces, this meeting took place in humbler surroundings: Trump and Xi met in a small grey building with a blue roof on a military base adjacent to Busan&#x27;s international airport.The anticipated detente has given investors and businesses caught between the two nations a sense of relief. The US stock market has climbed on the hopes of a trade framework coming out of the meeting.READ MORE: Searchers to drain large dam in renewed search for missing boy Gus Pressure points remain for both US and ChinaTrump has outward confidence that the grounds for a deal are in place, but previous negotiations with China this year in Geneva, Switzerland and London had a start-stop quality to them.The initial promise of progress has repeatedly given way to both countries seeking a better position against the other.\"The proposed deal on the table fits the pattern we&#x27;ve seen all year: short-term stabilisation dressed up as strategic progress,\" Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, said.\"Both sides are managing volatility, calibrating just enough cooperation to avert crisis while the deeper rivalry endures.\"The US and China have each shown they believe they have levers to pressure the other, and the past year has demonstrated that tentative steps forward can be short-lived.For Trump, that pressure comes from tariffs.READ MORE: Cricketer killed in training tragedy remembered as &#x27;shining light&#x27; China had faced new tariffs this year totalling 30 per cent, of which 20 per cent were tied to its role in fentanyl production. But the tariff rates have been volatile. In April, he announced plans to jack the rate on Chinese goods to 145 per cent, only to abandon those plans as markets recoiled.Then, on October 10, Trump threatened a 100 per cent import tax because of China&#x27;s rare earth restrictions. That figure, including past tariffs, would now be 47 per cent \"effective immediately,\" Trump told reporters this afternoon.Xi has his own chokehold on the world economy because China is the top producer and processor of the rare earth minerals needed to make fighter jets, robots, electric vehicles and other high-tech products.China had tightened export restrictions on October 9, repeating a cycle in which each nation jockeys for an edge only to back down after more trade talks.What might also matter is what happens directly after their talks. Trump plans to return to Washington, while Xi plans to stay on in South Korea to meet with regional leaders during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which officially begins on Friday.\"Xi sees an opportunity to position China as a reliable partner and bolster bilateral and multilateral relations with countries frustrated by the US administration&#x27;s tariff policy,\" Jay Truesdale, a former State Department official who is CEO of TD International, a risk and intelligence advisory firm, said.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
