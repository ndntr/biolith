The VC can also be awarded posthumously , including one announced last year on Remembrance Day to the late Richard Nordern VC for gallantry during the Battle of Fire Support Base Coral in Vietnam in 1968.READ MORE: Blast kills at least eight at historic tourist spotThe first VCs were struck from the bronze of a Russian artillery gun captured during the Crimean War in the mid-1800s.Every Victoria Cross ever made has been manufactured by the same jewellers, Hancock&#x27;s and Co of London.\"The Victoria Cross, which ranks next to the George Cross, is considered the most prestigious award that can be bestowed on an individual for valour in the face of an enemy,\" Anderson said.\"We are honoured that we can display these medals for the public and help them gain a deeper understanding of these extraordinary individuals and their stories.\"What is Remembrance Day?Remembrance Day marks the end of fighting in World War I on the Western Front on November 11, 1918.Formerly known as Armistice Day - in reference to the German surrender in 1918 - the name was changed to Remembrance Day in 1945.Every year, one minute of silence is held at 11am (local time) on November 11 in Australia and other Commonwealth nations.While Remembrance Day marks the end of World War I, the loss of Australian lives from all wars and conflicts past and present are commemorated.The red poppy is the best-known symbol of remembrance.On the mud-soaked battlefields of northern France, the wild flower grew abundantly after the close of World War I.READ MORE: US snubs key climate talks as host slams &#x27;denialists&#x27;What events are held?Commemorative services are held in Australia at memorials, schools and community centres today.The national ceremony is organised by the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.Across Australia, everyone is welcome to attend a Remembrance Day service.They are free and you don&#x27;t need to be a Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL) member to attend a service at your local sub-branch.As part of the commemorations, the Sydney Opera House will be lit with the symbolic red poppies.READ MORE: Trump pardons Rudy Giuliani, others involved in efforts to overturn 2020 electionWhat happens at a Remembrance Day service?Flags are lowered to half-mast about 10.30am (AEDT) before a service starts at 10.45am and the catafalque party will mount the cenotaph and take their positions. Typically, the service will start with an Acknowledgement of Country, welcome speech, and words of experience or reflection from a veteran or service personnel.After this, it&#x27;s common that a hymn, prayer or reading is shared before dignitaries and other guests of honour lay wreaths or poppies.It&#x27;s customary to recite The Ode, play the Last Post, and observe one minute of silence.The minute&#x27;s silence concludes with the playing of The Rouse and a designated spokesperson saying the iconic words, \"lest we forget\".Sign up here to receive our daily newsletters and breaking news alerts, sent straight to your inbox.",
