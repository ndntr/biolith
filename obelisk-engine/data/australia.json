He has since been moved to a different hospital to continue treatment.READ MORE: Police say &#x27;hope fading&#x27; to find kidnapped Sydney grandfatherThere is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Matt Utai, and police say he is not involved in any criminal activity.Authorities said the alleged gunman fired from an SUV before it drove away on Tuesday.A short time later, the car, a black Toyota, was found burnt out in the nearby suburb of Wiley Park.The following night, at about 12.45am, shots were fired at a house in St Clair. A woman in her 50s was uninjured inside. A second burnt-out car discovered a short time later in Colyton was seized by police for forensic examination.The morning following the second shooting, at 6.05am, a fire broke out at a Guildford West house and a nearby car was set alight. Firefighters extinguished both blazes, and no one was injured.Yesterday, officers raided four properties in Riverwood, Guildford, Lilyfield, Villawood and Auburn and seized three vehicles, 1kg of cocaine, knuckle dusters, electronics and clothing.An 18-year-old man was arrested in Riverwood, and a 19-year-old man was arrested in Villawood.READ MORE: US President Donald Trump says ex-prince Andrew&#x27;s arrest &#x27;very, very sad to me&#x27; \" We will allege in court that those two men were involved in the firebombing of that home in Hunt Street, Guildford,\" Detective Acting Superintendent Brad Abdy said.Both have been charged to appear in court today.
