          "content": "Tropical Cyclone Mitchell is forecast to intensify to a category 3 storm before it makes landfall in Western Australia &#x27;s Pilbara region, breaking an eight-year record for the nation.Mitchell is sitting off the coast about 140km north of Port Hedland as a category 2 storm and is on track to worsen as it passes north of Karratha overnight.The Bureau of Meteorology is anticipating heavy rainfall and flash flooding later today and has already recorded wind gusts of up to 130km/h.READ MORE: WA Police Commissioner grilled on response to alleged terror bombing at rallyResidents in De Grey to Ningaloo, including Port Hedland, Karratha, Onslow, Exmouth, Pilbara and Pannawonica are under the warning zone.The Department of Fire and Emergency Services has issued a watch and act warning to those in Whim Creek to Mardie, including Barrow Island and Montebello Islands, urging them to prepare to take shelter.\"There is a possible threat to lives and homes as a cyclone is approaching the area,\" the warning reads.An evacuation centre will be open in the Karratha Leisureplex from midday today.Residents south of Mardie to Carnarvon and inland to Pannawonica are urged to prepare now, while those in Pardoo Roadhouse to east of Whim Creek are advised to monitor conditions. Mitchell is expected to continue travelling south to the Pilbara coast at 17km/h tomorrow, where it will remain until it makes landfall there by Monday. \"That&#x27;s pretty fast for a tropical cyclone, and as we&#x27;ll see as we play through the track map for the rest of the day on Saturday, that movement is going to take it quite close to the coastline,\" the bureau&#x27;s Senior Meteorologist Angus Hines said.READ MORE: Author accused of child exploitation returns to courtHeavy rainfall and potential flash flooding are forecast for the area and could extend to the west Gascoyne region.\"Rainfall could cause rivers to rise and burst their banks, and flash flooding could cause areas of flooding anywhere that the rain is heavy, that can lead to road closures and potentially community isolation,\" Hines said. Abnormally high tides are also feared to cause serious flooding in the Karratha region early tomorrow morning and then in the Onslow region by the afternoon.Very destructive winds are expected to extend to Onslow and possibly Exmouth, reaching up to 170km/h, which Hines said could bring down trees and powerlines and damage property.The cyclone is forecast to downgrade to a category 2 storm by Monday night and then a category 1 by Tuesday. But Hines said remnants of the system will continue to be felt across parts of the state.\"This weather system is not going to dissipate quickly as we continue into Monday and next week, we&#x27;ll see the remnants of the system, even though it won&#x27;t be a tropical cyclone anymore, are going to plunge deeply into central parts of Western Australia,\" he said.Mitchell is the ninth tropical cyclone in the 2025-26 season, and if it crosses the coast, it would be the fifth this year.This would be the most cyclones to reach the mainland since five made landfall in eight years, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

The aircraft crashed into the ocean in Long Bay, near Goolwa South, just before 4.30pm local time (5pm AEDT) in front of several beachgoers, which sparked a major emergency response.Police have since recovered the bodies of all three men who were on board - 57-year-old pilot Leo Howard and his 18-year-old and 19-year-old passengers.READ MORE: Aussies dealt $250 billion blow as cost of controversial policy snowballsThe trio were on a scenic flight over one of the state&#x27;s most picturesque places, where the Murray River meets the ocean near the Fleurieu Peninsula town of Goolwa.Howard was an experienced pilot in both regular flights and aerobatic flying.His sister described him as a loved son, father and brother.The Cessna 210 Centurian involved in the crash is a single-engine aircraft and part of a small fleet operated by local charter and training company Goolwa Air. The wreckage of the light plane has been brought to shore.Investigators from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau will now try to determine what went wrong.A focus of the investigation will be how Howard appeared to lose all control in the final moments, as well as the 40-year-old aircraft&#x27;s flight and maintenance history.A report will also be prepared for the coroner.
