It&#x27;s a reflection of who we are – a vibrant, diverse and inclusive city. Those values are more important than ever.\"Moore said the small tributes to the Bondi attack offered a chance \"to reflect on the atrocity and to say we will not let this hateful act of terror divide us\".Extra public transport services Roads were closed in the city centre as huge crowds poured onto the harbour foreshore.Roads in Circular Quay were closed north of Bridge Street.Roads in The Rocks and Barangaroo were closed including a section of Harrington, Essex and Argyle streets and a section of Hickson Road.
