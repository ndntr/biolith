          "content": "The United States is offering Ukraine security guarantees for a period of 15 years as part of a proposed peace plan, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Monday, though he said he would prefer an American commitment of up to 50 years to deter Russia from further attempts to seize its neighbour&#x27;s land by force.US President Donald Trump hosted Zelenskyy at his Florida resort on Sunday and insisted that Ukraine and Russia are \"closer than ever before\" to a peace settlement.Negotiators are still searching for a breakthrough on key issues, however, including whose forces withdraw from where and the fate of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of the 10 biggest in the world. Trump noted that the monthslong US-led negotiations could still collapse.READ MORE: Peace proposal &#x27;90 per cent&#x27; agreed after Trump-Zelenskyy meeting\"Without security guarantees, realistically, this war will not end,\" Zelenskyy told reporters in voice messages responding to questions sent via a Whatsapp chat.Ukraine has been fighting Russia since 2014, when it illegally annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists took up arms in the Donbas, a vital industrial region in eastern Ukraine.Details of the security guarantees have not become public but Zelenskyy said on Monday that they include how a peace deal would be monitored as well as the \"presence\" of partners. He didn&#x27;t elaborate, but Russia has said it won&#x27;t accept the deployment in Ukraine of troops from NATO countries.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump were expected to speak in the near future but there was no indication the Russian leader would speak to Zelenskyy.French President Emmanuel Macron said Kyiv&#x27;s allies will meet in Paris in early January to \"finalise each country&#x27;s concrete contributions\" to the security guarantees.Trump said he would consider extending US security guarantees for Ukraine beyond 15 years, according to Zelenskyy. The guarantees would be approved by the US Congress as well as by parliaments in other countries involved in overseeing any settlement, he said.Zelenskyy said he wants the 20-point peace plan under discussion to be approved by Ukrainians in a national referendum.However, holding a ballot requires a ceasefire of at least 60 days, and Moscow has shown no willingness for a truce without a full settlement.",

          "content": "China&#x27;s military on Monday dispatched air, navy and rocket troops to conduct joint military drills around the island of Taiwan, a move Beijing called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces. Taiwan said it was placing its forces on alert and called the Chinese government “the biggest destroyer of peace.”The drills came after Beijing expressed anger at US arms sales to the territory and a statement by Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, saying its military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that the world’s second-biggest economy says must come under its rule. READ MORE: Prime Minister rejects plea from Bondi shooting victims&#x27; families But the Chinese military did not mention the United States and Japan in its statement.Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said in a post on X that rapid response exercises were underway, with forces on high alert to defend the island. In a separate statement, it said it had deployed appropriate forces in response, conducting combat readiness drills.“The Chinese Communist Party’s targeted military exercises further confirm its nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace,” the ministry said.READ MORE: Legionnaires&#x27; disease outbreak in Sydney CBD grows Senior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;s Eastern Theater Command, said the drills would be conducted in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, southwest, southeast and east of the island.Shi said the activities will focus on sea-air combat readiness patrol, “joint seizure of comprehensive superiority” and blockades on key ports. It was also the first large-scale military drill where the command publicly mentioned one of the goals was “all-dimensional deterrence outside the island chain.\"“It is a stern warning against ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces, and it is a legitimate and necessary action to safeguard China’s sovereignty and national unity,” Shi said.China and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949, when a civil war brought the Communist Party to power in Beijing. Defeated Nationalist Party forces fled to Taiwan. The island has operated since then with its own government, though the mainland’s government claims it as sovereign territory.Live firing exercises scheduled for TuesdayThe command said it was using fighters, bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles in coordination with long-range rocket launches to conduct drills in the sea and airspace in the middle areas of the Taiwan Strait on Monday, focusing on striking mobile ground targets. They are intended to test the troops&#x27; capabilities of precision strikes on key targets, it said.It also said major military drills were scheduled to happen between 8am and 6pm on Tuesday, saying it would organise live firing activities then, and its exercises would cover five areas around the island.The command released themed posters about the drills online accompanied by provocative wording. One poster depicted two shields with the Great Wall alongside three military aircraft and two ships. Its social media post said the drills were about the “Shield of Justice, Smashing Illusion,\" adding that any foreign interlopers or separatists touching the shields would be eliminated.Last week, Beijing imposed sanctions against 20 US defense-related companies and 10 executives, a week after Washington announced large-scale arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion. If approved by the US Congress, it would be the largest-ever American weapons package to the self-ruled territory.Under US federal law in place for many years, Washington is obligated to assist Taipei with its defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China. The US and Taiwan had formal diplomatic relations until 1979, when President Jimmy Carter’s administration recognised and established relations with Beijing.READ MORE: Russia is &#x27;helping China to prepare for a potential invasion of Taiwan&#x27; Taiwanese army on high alertMonday&#x27;s drills heightened tensions on both sides. Karen Kuo, spokesperson for the Taiwanese president&#x27;s office, said the operation was undermining the stability and security of the Taiwan Strait and Indo-Pacific region and openly challenging international law and order.“Our country strongly condemns the Chinese authorities for disregarding international norms and using military intimidation to threaten neighboring countries.” she said.Beijing sends warplanes and navy vessels toward the island on a near-daily basis, and in recent years it has stepped up the scope and scale of these exercises. In October, the Taiwanese government said it would accelerate the building of a “Taiwan Shield” or “T-Dome” air defense system in the face of the military threat from China.The military tensions came a day after Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said he hoped the Taiwan Strait would be associated with peace and prosperity, instead of “crashing waves and howling winds,\" during a trip to Shanghai.",
