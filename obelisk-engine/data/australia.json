          "content": "A police officer accused of the murder of a TV presenter and his partner claims he agreed to admit to manslaughter, but prosecutors and police denied his offer.As Beaumont Lamarre-Condon formally pleaded not guilty to the murders of Jesse Baird and Luke Davies, he interrupted the court to launch a tirade at investigators.The 29-year-old said he opposed any orders for a closed court at his trial because he wanted people to know the truth of his case.READ MORE: Major police operation underway in Sydney&#x27;s south-west He also accused both NSW Police and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions of being corrupt.\"I will not be silenced,\" Lamarre-Condon said via video-link in the NSW Supreme Court today. The accused double-murderer claimed he had previously offered to prosecutors to plead guilty to one charge of manslaughter while in a lower court, but this was rejected.Justice Peter Hamill indicated that if such negotiations had taken place, then they would have been recorded in the court file.Lamarre-Condon became the first serving NSW police officer charged with murder in several decades after he was accused of shooting the couple at Baird&#x27;s Paddington home in Sydney&#x27;s east. Police allege the former officer then bundled their bodies in surfboard bags and dumped them at a rural property.READ MORE: Diddy says he&#x27;s &#x27;humbled and broken&#x27; in letter to judge ahead of sentencing They were found eight days later after Lamarre-Condon handed himself in.The case has been mired in delays since, with the now-sacked senior constable changing lawyers twice and negotiations with prosecutors dragging on for months.For the first time since he was arrested, the words \"not guilty\" left Lamarre-Condon&#x27;s lips in open court as he was asked to answer to two counts of domestic violence-related murder.He also pleaded not guilty to aggravated break and enter.The 30-year-old appeared on screen from prison, wearing a green polo shirt and sporting facial stubble.His trial is set to begin on September 21, 2026.NSW Police allege the attack was premeditated and followed a months-long campaign of \"predatory behaviour\" targeting Baird.Lamarre-Condon briefly dated the TV presenter before Baird began a relationship with Davies.READ MORE: Tony Mokbel cleared of some drug trafficking charges, to face retrial on others Police allege the former senior constable used his service weapon to shoot the couple before attempting to dispose of their bodies.Suspicions were raised two days later when blood-stained possessions belonging to both men were found in a skip bin in Sydney&#x27;s south.The discovery led police to Baird&#x27;s blood-smeared share house, about 30km away in inner-city Paddington.Lamarre-Condon handed himself in to police two days later and allegedly directed police to their bodies on a rural property nearly 200km southwest of Sydney.The senior constable was sacked by NSW Police weeks after being charged.He joined the force in 2019 and previously ran a celebrity blog, posing in photos with dozens of A-listers including Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus and Harry Styles.Support is available from the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service at 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732).DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
