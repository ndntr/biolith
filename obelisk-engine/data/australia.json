Sort of surprised, but they were waiting for something. It was a lot of opposition. There was a lot of gunfire,\" he said.Trump said lights in Caracas were shut off during the operation to capture Maduro, which began just before 2am on Saturday (6pm AEDT).\"No nation in the world could achieve what America achieved yesterday,\" Trump said this morning.READ MORE: Who is Nicolas Maduro? From bus driver to Venezuela president\"In just a short period of time, all Venezuelan military capacities were rendered powerless as the men and women of our military, working with us, law enforcement, successfully captured Maduro in the dead of night.\"It was dark, the lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have.\"It was dark and it was deadly.\"Vice president sworn in, speaking with USThere were mixed reactions from citizens: supporters of Maduro were seen embracing each other on the streets of Caracas, while elsewhere, such as in Madrid, Spain, Venezuelans celebrated the downfall of Maduro.Maduro&#x27;s government urged citizens to take to the streets. Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado, the most prominent political opposition of Maduro, posted a statement saying: \"Venezuelans, the time for freedom has come.\"It was not immediately clear who was running Venezuela in the hours after Maduro&#x27;s capture.Under Venezuelan law, Vice President Delcy Rodríguez would be expected to take power. READ MORE: &#x27;Extraordinary&#x27; couple gunned down in their US homeTrump said she had been sworn in as president but was speaking with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. \"She is essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again. Very simple,\" Trump said. Earlier, Machado – who has been living outside of Venezuela for her own safety – said that the opposition candidate Edmundo González should assume power, saying that he rightfully won the 2024 presidential election. Maduro and wife to face &#x27;justice&#x27; The capture of a sitting leader marked the culmination of an escalating Trump administration pressure campaign on the South American country that consisted of months of strikes on boats officials said were smuggling drugs to the US.US Attorney General Pam Bondi said Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, would face charges after an indictment in New York, vowing that the couple would \"soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts\".Maduro and other Venezuelan officials were indicted in 2020 on \"narco-terrorism\" conspiracy charges, but it was not previously known that his wife had been.It wasn&#x27;t clear if Bondi was referring to a new indictment when she said the pair would face justice. The details of the allegations against Flores were not immediately known.On Friday, a day before the attack, Venezuela said it was open to negotiating an agreement with the US to combat drug trafficking.Maduro also said in a pre-taped interview that aired on Thursday that the US wanted to force a government change in Venezuela and gain access to its vast oil reserves through the monthslong pressure campaign that began with a massive military deployment to the Caribbean Sea in August.The CIA was behind a drone strike last week at a docking area believed to have been used by Venezuelan drug cartels in what was the first known direct operation on Venezuelan soil since the US began strikes on boats in September.Trump for months had threatened that he could soon order strikes on targets on Venezuelan land. The US has also seized sanctioned oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela, and Trump ordered a blockade of others in a move that seemed designed to put a tighter chokehold on the South American country&#x27;s economy.The US military has been attacking boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean since early September. As of Friday, the number of known boat strikes was 35 and the number of people killed was at least 115, according to numbers announced by the Trump administration.They followed a major buildup of American forces in the waters off South America, including the arrival in November of the nation&#x27;s most advanced aircraft carrier, which added thousands more troops to what was already the largest military presence in the region in generations.Trump has justified the boat strikes as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the US and asserted that the US is engaged in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels.&#x27;This is horrible&#x27; There had been at least seven explosions in the US strike, which sent people rushing into the streets.It was not clear how many people had been injured during the operation that lasted about 30 minutes. \"One [explosion] was so strong, my window was shaking after it,\" CNN correspondent Osmary Hernandez said.Smoke could be seen rising from the hangar of a military base in Caracas. Another military installation in the capital was without power.\"The whole ground shook. This is horrible. We heard explosions and planes in the distance,\" said Carmen Hidalgo, a 21-year-old office worker, her voice trembling.She was walking briskly with two relatives, returning from a birthday party.\"We felt like the air was hitting us.\"Venezuela&#x27;s government has called on its supporters to take to the streets.\"People to the streets!\" the government said in a statement.\"The Bolivarian government calls on all social and political forces in the country to activate mobilisation plans and repudiate this imperialist attack.\"The statement added that Maduro had \"ordered all national defence plans to be implemented\" and declared \"a state of external disturbance\".- Reported with Associated Press and CNN",

          "content": "US President Donald Trump announced early on Saturday morning (Saturday night AEDT) that the US carried out a \"large-scale strike against Venezuela\" and that President Nicolas Maduro and his wife had been captured, a stunning development that plunged the country into uncertainty after weeks of spiraling tensions.\"The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolás Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,\" he wrote on Truth Social.Venezuela requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council in response to the attack, Foreign Minister Yván Gil Pinto said.READ MORE: Why is the US attacking Venezuela?\"No cowardly attack will prevail against the strength of this people, who will emerge victorious,\" he said on Telegram, sharing the letter sent to the UN.Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez said in an audio call with state-run VTV that the government doesn&#x27;t know the whereabouts of Maduro and first lady Cilia Flores, demanding \"immediate proof of life\" from the Trump administration.Speaking to Fox News on Saturday morning, Trump said that Maduro and his wife are aboard the USS Iwo Jima heading to New York. Earlier, in an interview with The New York Times, he declined to answer questions about whether he had sought congressional authorisation for the strike, saying he would address the issue at a news conference.Here&#x27;s what we know.What has happened?A CNN team witnessed several explosions and heard the sounds of aircraft early Saturday in the Venezuelan capital Caracas, and reported that some areas of the city were without electricity.Videos verified by CNN showed helicopters roaring over Caracas, with plumes of smoke rising into the night sky. Footage also showed a large blaze and explosions at an airport in the city of Higuerote.Hours after the strikes, CNN&#x27;s Mary Mena said from Caracas that the capital was calm.\"We listened to many airplanes and helicopters passing by, but right now the city remains quiet, for the past two hours,\" she said. \"We haven&#x27;t heard people for example coming to the streets, and the state channel keeps repeating this message from the ministry of defense saying they want people to remain calm and they will deploy military forces across the country.\"READ MORE: US captures Venezuela&#x27;s president and wife, removes them from the country The first blast witnessed by the CNN team was recorded about 1.50am (5.50pm AEDT).\"One was so strong, my window was shaking after it,\" CNN correspondent Osmary Hernandez said.Several areas of the city were without power, and CNN journalists in the capital heard the sound of aircraft after the explosions.One video obtained and verified by CNN showed two plumes of smoke rising into the night sky amid city lights. An orange glow could be seen at the base of one of the plumes. Then a flash in another location was briefly seen, followed by a dull booming sound.Two sources familiar with the matter said that Maduro and his wife were dragged from their bedroom by US forces during the raid that led to their capture. The couple was captured in the middle of the night as they were sleeping, the sources said.The raid, carried out by the US Army&#x27;s elite Delta Force, did not lead to any US casualties, a US official said.Why is it happening?The Trump administration has for years said that Maduro was a criminal and has looked to prosecute him through the US legal system.In 2020, during Trump&#x27;s first term, Maduro was charged in the Southern District of New York for \"narco-terrorism\", conspiracy to import cocaine, and related charges.The Trump administration offered a $US15 million ($22 million) bounty for Maduro&#x27;s arrest. That bounty was increased to $US25 million ($37 million) in the waning days of the Biden administration, in early January 2025, and was increased again, to $US50 million ($74 million), in August 2025 after Trump took office for a second term and designated Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization. The administration has claimed that Maduro is the leader of that group, which it describes as a criminal organisation.Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee said Secretary of State Marco Rubio told him that Maduro was arrested to stand trial in the US.\"He informed me that Nicolás Maduro has been arrested by US personnel to stand trial on criminal charges in the United States, and that the kinetic action we saw tonight was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant,\" Lee posted on X early Saturday.In recent weeks, Trump had repeatedly warned that the US was preparing to take new action against alleged drug trafficking networks in Venezuela and that strikes on land will start \"soon\".Trump&#x27;s pressure campaign on Maduro has included strikes destroying more than 30 boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean in what the US has described as a counter-narcotics campaign. Trump last month ordered a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers coming to and leaving Venezuela.The CIA carried out a drone strike in December on a port facility on the coast of Venezuela, CNN reported last month, citing sources, marking the first known US attack on a target inside that country.How has the international community reacted?Several world leaders have reacted with concern to the US operation.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he \"wants to establish the facts\" and speak to Trump about the military operation in Venezuela, according to the UK&#x27;s PA Media news agency.\"I always say and believe we should all uphold international law,\" Starmer said, adding that Britain was \"not involved in any way\" in the strike on Caracas, PA Media reported.Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said in a post on X that the commission \"stand(s) by the people of Venezuela and support(s) a peaceful and democratic transition. Any solution must respect international law and the UN Charter.\"Meanwhile, Venezuela&#x27;s allies Russia and Iran condemned the US attack.The Russian foreign ministry denounced what it called an \"act of armed aggression against Venezuela\" by the US, calling any \"excuses\" given to justify such actions \"untenable\".\"We reaffirm our solidarity with the Venezuelan people and our support for the Bolivarian leadership&#x27;s course of action aimed at protecting the country&#x27;s national interests and sovereignty,\" a statement from the foreign ministry said. \"Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, interference from outside.\"Similarly, the Iranian foreign ministry said the attack violates Venezuela&#x27;s sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as the UN charter, Iranian state news outlet Press TV reported.What comes next?What happens next in Venezuela is far from clear. The country&#x27;s constitution states that power will pass to Maduro&#x27;s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez.But the future of the regime is in doubt, and the opposition – within and outside the country – will likely see this moment as a critical opportunity.Venezuela&#x27;s opposition says the rightful president is the exiled politician Edmundo Gonzalez.Amid the uncertainty, there are a range of scenarios.If the constitutional path – Article 233 – is followed, in the \"absolute absence\" of the president, the executive vice president – Delcy Rodriguez – takes over and calls for an election within 30 days. The newly elected president then serves a full six-year term.The regime collapses and its senior figures resign or flee, the most likely opposition candidate is Edmundo González Urrutia, who ran in the 2024 election. Gonzales, an academic and long-time diplomat, is now in exile in Spain. He is supported by the recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, democratic activist María Corina Machado. Speaking in Oslo last month after receiving the prize, Machado said her movement was preparing for \"an orderly and peaceful transition\" once Maduro was gone. She said in December that González had invited her to be vice-president and that \"the vast majority\" of the police and armed forces would follow the new administration&#x27;s orders once the political transition began.There could also be a military takeover. But the current defence minister, Vladimir Padrino López, has spoken out against the US strikes, saying Venezuela would resist the presence of foreign troops in the country. \"This invasion represents the greatest outrage the country has suffered,\" he said.",

The authoritarian president faces charges of narco-terrorism in the US.Maduro insists the real purpose of the US military operations has been to force him from power.READ MORE: Teen arrested in US in alleged ISIS-inspired attack plot intended for New Year&#x27;s Eve Here is a timeline of the US military actions, concerns among some politicians and the response in Venezuela:Jan. 20, 2025Trump signs an executive order that paves the way for criminal organisations and drug cartels to be named \"foreign terrorist organisations.\" They include Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan street gang.The US intelligence community has disputed Trump&#x27;s central claim that Maduro&#x27;s administration is working with Tren de Aragua and orchestrating drug trafficking and illegal immigration into the US.Feb. 20The Trump administration formally designates eight Latin American crime organisations as foreign terrorist organisations.The label is normally reserved for groups like al-Qaida or the Islamic State that use violence for political ends — not for profit-focused crime rings.Aug. 19The US military deploys three guided-missile destroyers to the waters off Venezuela.The naval force in the Caribbean grows within weeks to include three amphibious assault ships and other vessels, carrying about 6000 sailors and Marines and a variety of aircraft.The US deploys F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico in September, while a Navy submarine carrying cruise missiles operates off South America.Sept. 2The US carries out its first strike against what Trump says was a drug-carrying vessel that departed from Venezuela and was operated by Tren de Aragua.Trump says all 11 people on the boat were killed and posts a short video clip of a small vessel appearing to explode in flames.Sept. 10In a letter to the White House, Democratic senators say the Trump administration has provided \"no legitimate legal justification\" for the strike.Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, says in a floor speech that week that the US military is not \"empowered to hunt down suspected criminals and kill them without trial\".Sept. 15The US military carries out its second strike against an alleged drug boat, killing three people.Asked what proof the US has that the vessel was carrying drugs, Trump told reporters that big bags of cocaine and fentanyl were spattered all over the ocean. However, images of what Trump described were not released by the military or the White House.Sept. 19Trump says the US military carried out its third fatal strike against an alleged drug-smuggling vessel. Several senators and human rights groups continue to question the legality of the strikes, describing them as a potential overreach of executive authority.Oct. 2Trump declares drug cartels to be unlawful combatants and says the US is now in an \"armed conflict\" with them, according to a Trump administration memo obtained by The Associated Press.The memo appears to represent an extraordinary assertion of presidential war powers and draws criticism from some lawmakers, including Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.Oct. 3Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth says he ordered a fourth strike on a small boat he accuses of carrying drugs.Oct. 8Senate Republicans vote down legislation that would have required the president to seek authorisation from Congress before further military strikes.Oct. 14Trump announces the fifth strike against a small boat accused of carrying drugs, saying it killed six people.Oct. 15Trump confirms he has authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela and says he is weighing carrying out land operations in the country.He declines to say whether the CIA has authority to take action against Maduro.Oct. 16The Navy admiral who oversees military operations in the region says he will retire in December.Admiral Alvin Holsey became leader of US Southern Command only the previous November, overseeing an area that encompasses the Caribbean and waters off South America. Such postings typically last three to four years.Oct. 16Trump says the US struck a sixth suspected drug-carrying vessel in the Caribbean, killing two people and leaving two survivors who were on the semi-submersible craft.The president later says the survivors would be sent to Ecuador and Colombia, their home countries, \"for detention and prosecution\". Repatriation avoided questions about what their legal status would have been in the US justice system.Oct. 17The US military attacks a seventh vessel that Hegseth says was carrying \"substantial amounts of narcotics\" and associated with a Colombian rebel group, the National Liberation Army, or ELN. Three people are killed.Oct. 20Representative Adam Smith, top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, calls for a hearing on the boat strikes.\"Never before in my over 20 years on the committee can I recall seeing a combatant commander leave their post this early and amid such turmoil,\" Smith said in a statement of Holsey&#x27;s impending departure. \"I have also never seen such a staggering lack of transparency on behalf of an Administration and the Department to meaningfully inform Congress on the use of lethal military force.\"Oct. 21Hegseth says the US military launched its eighth strike against an alleged drug-carrying vessel, killing two people in the eastern Pacific.The attack marks an expansion of the military&#x27;s targeting area to the waters off South America where much of the cocaine from the world&#x27;s largest producers is smuggled.Oct. 22Hegseth announces the ninth strike, another in the eastern Pacific, saying three men are killed.Oct. 24Hegseth orders the US military&#x27;s most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, to the region in a significant escalation of military firepower.Oct. 24Hegseth says the military conducted the 10th strike on a suspected drug-running boat, leaving six people dead.Oct. 27Hegseth says three more strikes were carried out in the eastern Pacific, killing 14 people and leaving one survivor.Hegseth says Mexican authorities \"assumed responsibility for coordinating the rescue\" of the sole survivor, who is presumed dead after Mexico suspended its search.Oct. 29Hegseth says the US military carried out another strike on a boat he said was carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific, killing all four people aboard in the 14th attack.Oct. 29Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, says the Trump administration briefed Republicans — but not Democrats — on the boat strikes.The Senate at the time was facing a potential vote on a war powers resolution that would prohibit strikes in or near Venezuela without congressional approval.Oct. 31UN human rights chief Volker Türk calls for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to be the first such condemnation of its kind from a United Nations organisation.Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for Türk&#x27;s office, relayed his message at a briefing: \"The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.\"Nov. 1Hegseth announces the 15th known strike, saying three people were killed.Nov. 4In the 16th known strike, Hegseth posts on social media that two people were killed aboard a vessel in the eastern Pacific.Nov. 6Hegseth announces the 17th known strike, which killed three people.Senate Republicans vote to reject legislation that would have limited Trump&#x27;s ability to order an attack on Venezuelan soil without congressional authorisation. Lawmakers from both parties had demanded more information on the strikes, but Republicans appeared more willing to give Trump leeway to continue his buildup of naval forces.Nov. 9The US military strikes two vessels in the eastern Pacific, killing six people, according to an announcement from Hegseth the following day.Nov. 10The 20th known strike on a boat accused of transporting drugs kills four people in the Caribbean, according to a social media post from the US military&#x27;s Southern Command.Nov. 11Venezuela&#x27;s government launches what it says is a \"massive\" mobilisation of troops and volunteers for two days of exercises prompted by the US military buildup.Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino López asserts that Venezuela&#x27;s military is \"stronger than ever in its unity, morale and equipment\".Nov. 15Three people are killed after the US military conducts its 21st strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat in the eastern Pacific, according to a post from Southern Command a day later.Nov. 16The Ford arrives in the Caribbean, a major moment in the Trump administration&#x27;s show of force.The aircraft carrier&#x27;s arrival brings the total number of troops in the region to about 12,000 on nearly a dozen Navy ships in what Hegseth has dubbed \"Operation Southern Spear\".Nov. 16Trump says the US \"may be having some discussions\" with Maduro and \"Venezuela would like to talk\", without offering details.\"I&#x27;ll talk to anybody,\" Trump said. \"We&#x27;ll see what happens.\"Dec. 4Admiral Frank \"Mitch\" Bradley appears for closed-door classified briefings at the Capitol as lawmakers begin investigating the strikes. The investigation began following reports that Bradley ordered a follow-on attack that killed the survivors of the first strike on September 2 to comply with Hegseth&#x27;s demands.Republican Senator Tom Cotton later tells reporters that \"Bradley was very clear that he was given no such order, to give no quarter or to kill them all\".Democrats say they found the video of the entire attack disturbing.Washington Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, says the survivors were \"basically two shirtless people clinging to the bow of a capsized and inoperable boat, drifting in the water — until the missiles come and kill them\".Dec. 4Four people are killed in the 22nd strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat in the eastern Pacific, according to a post from Southern Command.Dec. 10The US seizes an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela after the ship left that country with about 2 million barrels of heavy crude.Attorney General Pam Bondi says the tanker was involved in \"an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organisations\". Venezuela&#x27;s government says the seizure \"constitutes a blatant theft and an act of international piracy\".Dec. 15The US military strikes three alleged drug-smuggling boats, killing eight people, in the eastern Pacific Ocean, Southern Command announces.Dec. 16Hegseth says the Pentagon will not publicly release unedited video of the September 2 strike that killed two survivors, even as questions mount in Congress about the attack and the overall campaign near Venezuela.Dec. 16Trump says he&#x27;s ordering a blockade of all \"sanctioned oil tankers\" going into and out of Venezuela, a move that seems designed to put a tighter chokehold on the South American country&#x27;s oil-dependent economy.Trump alleges that Venezuela is using oil to fund drug trafficking, terrorism and other crimes and vows to continue the military buildup until the country returns to the US oil, land and assets, though it&#x27;s unclear why the president feels the US has a claim.Dec. 17The US military says it attacked a boat accused of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean, killing four people.House Republicans rejected a pair of Democratic-backed resolutions that would have put a check on Trump&#x27;s power to use military force against drug cartels and Venezuela. They were the first votes in the House after Senate Republicans previously voted down similar war powers resolutions.Dec. 18The US military says it conducted two more strikes against boats that were allegedly smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific, killing five people.Dec. 20Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says the US Coast Guard, with help from the Defense Department, stopped a second oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.Dec. 22Trump confirms that the US Coast Guard is chasing another oil tanker that the administration describes as part of the \"dark fleet\".The US military says it attacked a boat accused of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean, killing four people.Dec. 29Trump tells reporters the US struck a facility where boats accused of carrying drugs \"load up\". He declines to say if the US military or the CIA carried out the strike on the dock or where it occurred. He does not confirm it happened in Venezuela.The US military says it attacked a boat accused of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean, killing two people.Dec. 30The CIA was behind the drone strike at a docking area believed to have been used by Venezuelan drug cartels, according to two people familiar with details of the classified operation who requested anonymity to discuss it.It is the first known direct operation on Venezuelan soil since the US began strikes in September. Venezuelan officials have not acknowledged the strike.Dec. 30The US military strikes three more boats that were allegedly smuggling drugs, killing three people in the first boat while people from the other two boats jumped overboard and may have survived, US Southern Command announces the following day.Dec. 31The US imposes sanctions on four firms operating in Venezuela&#x27;s oil sector and designates four additional oil tankers as blocked property and part of the larger shadow fleet that is evading US sanctions on Venezuela.Dec. 31The US military says it attacked two more boats, killing five people who were allegedly smuggling drugs along known trafficking routes.Jan. 3Multiple explosions rock Caracas in the early hours of the morning; Trump confirms the US has launched \"large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader\".Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife are captured and removed from the country.",
