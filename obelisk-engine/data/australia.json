The declaration, however, is not a ban on protests or marches , with police still aware of demonstrations planned to contest the visit of the controversial president.Police are preparing for the marches, saying that 3500 officers will be deployed across the city for the duration of Herzog&#x27;s three-day visit .\"It&#x27;s a significant policing presence, there&#x27;s no doubt about it,\" NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said.\"This is not business as usual.\"Having a head of state in NSW is something significant .\"The Palestine Action Group has said that up to 5000 people will march from Town Hall to State Parliament to oppose the visit of the Israeli President.READ MORE: Huge weather turnaround to bring storms, floods for every state and territoryThe government has emphasised that the major event declaration is being imposed to prevent the clash of mourners and protesters. \"This is about keeping people safe, lowering the temperature and ensuring Sydney remains calm and orderly,\" Minns said.The Albanese government invited the Israeli president to Australia to mourn with the Jewish community following December&#x27;s terror attack in Bondi.The NSW Police Commissioner announced earlier this week the extension of the Public Assembly Restriction Declaration (PARD) for certain parts of Sydney for the next two weeks.The declaration means public assemblies will be restricted in Sydney&#x27;s eastern suburbs and parts of Sydney&#x27;s CBD, excluding Hyde Park.READ MORE: Trump taking steps toward installing a Christopher Columbus statue near the White HouseForm 1 applications for the approval of public assemblies will also not be accepted in certain areas.Despite Monday&#x27;s planned protest falling within the restricted zone, members of the legislative councils have asked police to have their form 1 application granted. \" We remind you that the United Nations Special Commission of Inquiry has found that Isaac Herzog is guilty of direct and public incitement to commit genocide under article III(c) of the Genocide Convention,\" the statement reads.\"We urge you to grant this request and work with the organisers to ensure that this assembly and march event can go ahead.\" \"We are gravely concerned about the report that you intend to employ some 500 police officers to the protest event and the report of Acting Assistant Commissioner Paul Dunstan threatening to arrest people who wish to march on the planned route.\"The government is also urging people to avoid the city during peak periods on Monday afternoon and evening due to the expected congestion.\"If you don&#x27;t need to be in Sydney CBD on Monday afternoon, unless it&#x27;s absolutely essential, we ask that you not stick around in that area,\" Minns said.\"We know that&#x27;s an inconvenience for some people, but there&#x27;ll be an enormous number of NSW Police.\"NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",

          "content": "US President Donald Trump&#x27;s racist social media post featuring former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, as primates in a jungle was deleted after a backlash from both Republicans and Democrats who criticised the video as offensive.Trump said later Friday that he won&#x27;t apologise for the post: \"I didn&#x27;t make a mistake,\" he said.The Republican president&#x27;s post was blamed on a staffer after widespread backlash, from civil rights leaders to veteran Republican senators, for its treatment of the nation&#x27;s first Black president and first lady.READ MORE: Huge weather turnaround to bring storms, floods for every state and territoryA rare admission of a misstep by the White House, the deletion came hours after press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed \"fake outrage\" over the post.After calls for its removal — including by Republicans — the White House said a staffer had posted the video erroneously.The post was part of a flurry of overnight activity on Trump&#x27;s Truth Social account that amplified his false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, despite courts around the country and Trump&#x27;s first-term attorney general finding no evidence of systemic fraud.Trump has a record of intensely personal criticism of the Obamas and of using incendiary, sometimes racist, rhetoric — from feeding the lie that Obama was not a native-born US citizen to crude generalisations about majority-Black countries.The post came in the first week of Black History Month and days after a Trump proclamation cited \"the contributions of black Americans to our national greatness\" and \"the American principles of liberty, justice, and equality.\"An Obama spokeswoman said the former president, a Democrat, had no response.READ MORE: Star Aussie skier stretchered away after brutal training crash &#x27;An internet meme&#x27;Nearly all of the 62-second clip appears to be from a conservative video alleging deliberate tampering with voting machines in battleground states as 2020 votes were tallied.At the 60-second mark is a quick scene of two jungle primates, with the Obamas&#x27; smiling faces imposed on them.Those frames originated from a separate video, previously circulated by an influential conservative meme maker.It shows Trump as \"King of the Jungle\" and depicts Democratic leaders as animals, including Joe Biden, who is white, as a jungle primate eating a banana.\"This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from The Lion King,\" Leavitt said by text.Disney&#x27;s 1994 feature film that Leavitt referenced is set on the savannah, not in the jungle, and it does not include great apes.\"Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,\" Leavitt added.By noon, the post had been taken down, with responsibility placed on a Trump subordinate.Trump, answering questions from reporters accompanying him Friday night aboard Air Force One, said the video was about fraudulent elections and that he liked what he saw.\"I liked the beginning. I saw it and just passed it on, and I guess probably nobody reviewed the end of it,\" he said.Asked if he condemned the video&#x27;s racism, Trump said, \"Of course I do.\"The White House explanation raises questions about control of Trump&#x27;s social media account, which he&#x27;s used to levy import taxes, threaten military action, make other announcements and intimidate political rivals.The president often signs his name or initials after policy posts.The White House did not immediately respond to an inquiry about how posts are vetted and when the public can know when Trump himself is posting.Mark Burns, a pastor and a prominent Trump supporter who is Black, said Friday on X that he&#x27;d spoken \"directly\" with Trump and that he recommended to the president that he fire the staffer who posted the video and publicly condemn what happened.\"He knows this is wrong, offensive, and unacceptable,\" Burns posted.Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Yvette Clarke told The Associated Press she does \"not buy the White House&#x27;s commentary.\"\"If there wasn&#x27;t a climate, a toxic and racist climate within the White House, we wouldn&#x27;t see this type of behaviour regardless of who it&#x27;s coming from,\" Clarke said.She added that Trump \"is a racist, he&#x27;s a bigot, and he will continue to do things in his presidency to make that known\".READ MORE: Trump taking steps toward installing a Christopher Columbus statue near the White HouseCondemnation across the political spectrumTrump and White House social media accounts frequently repost memes and artificial intelligence-generated videos.As Leavitt, Trump allies typically cast them as humorous.This time, condemnations flowed from across the spectrum — along with demands for an apology that doesn&#x27;t appear to be coming.At a Black History Month market in Harlem, the historically Black neighborhood in New York City, vendor Jacklyn Monk said Trump&#x27;s post was embarrassing even if it was eventually deleted.\"The guy needs help. I&#x27;m sorry he&#x27;s representing our country. … It&#x27;s horrible that it was this month, but it would be horrible if it was in March also.\"In Atlanta, Bernice King, daughter of the assassinated civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., resurfaced her father&#x27;s words: \"Yes. I&#x27;m Black. I&#x27;m proud of it. I&#x27;m Black and beautiful.\"Black Americans, she said, \"are beloved of God as postal workers and professors, as a former first lady and president. We are not apes.\"The US Senate&#x27;s lone Black Republican, Tim Scott of South Carolina, called on Trump to take down the post.\"Praying it was fake because it&#x27;s the most racist thing I&#x27;ve seen out of this White House,\" said Scott, who chairs Senate Republicans&#x27; midterm campaign arm.READ MORE: Police extend protest restrictions ahead of Israeli president&#x27;s visitAnother Republican, Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, is white but represents the state with the largest percentage of Black residents. Wicker called the post \"totally unacceptable\" and said the president should apologise.Some Republicans who face tough reelections this November voiced concerns, as well.The result was an unusual cascade of intraparty criticism for a president who has enjoyed a stranglehold over fellow Republicans who stayed silent during previous Trump controversies for fear of a public spat with the president or losing his endorsement in a future campaign.NAACP President Derrick Johnson called the video \"utterly despicable\" and pointed to Trump&#x27;s wider political concerns that could help explain Republicans&#x27; willingness to speak out.Johnson asserted that Trump is trying to distract from economic conditions and attention on the Jeffrey Epstein case files.\"You know who isn&#x27;t in the Epstein files? Barack Obama,\" he said. \"You know who actually improved the economy as president? Barack Obama.\"READ MORE: Karina copped a $140 fine for parking the wrong way on a trip to the beachA long history of racismThere is a long history in the US of powerful white figures associating Black people with animals, including apes, in demonstrably false, racist ways.The practice dates to 18th century cultural racism and pseudo-scientific theories used to justify the enslavement of Black people, and later to dehumanise freed Black people as uncivilised threats to white people.Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, wrote in his famous text \"Notes on the State of Virginia\" that Black women were the preferred sexual partners of orangutans.President Dwight Eisenhower, discussing school desegregation in the 1950s, suggested white parents were rightfully concerned about their daughters being in classrooms with \"big Black bucks.\"Obama, as a candidate and president, was featured as a monkey or other primates on T-shirts and other merchandise.In his 2024 campaign, Trump said immigrants were \"poisoning the blood of our country,\" language similar to what Adolf Hitler used to dehumanise Jews in Nazi Germany.During his first White House term, Trump called a swath of majority-Black, developing nations \"shithole countries\".He initially denied saying it but admitted in December 2025 that he did.When Obama was in the White House, Trump pushed false claims that the 44th president, who was born in Hawaii, was born in Kenya and was constitutionally ineligible to serve.Trump, in interviews that helped endear him to conservatives, demanded that Obama prove he was a \"natural-born citizen\" as required to become president.Obama eventually released birth records, and Trump finally acknowledged during his 2016 campaign, after having won the Republican nomination, that Obama was born in Hawaii.But immediately after, he said, falsely, that his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, started the birtherism attacks.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
