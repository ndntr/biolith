          "content": "A French appeals court has handed a stiffer 10-year sentence to the only man who challenged his conviction for raping Gisèle Pelicot while she was drugged and unconscious.Husamettin Dogan, a 44-year-old construction worker, had been sentenced to nine years in prison in the first drugging-and-rape trial last year that riveted France and turned Pelicot into a global icon against sexual violence.The appeals jury was composed of three judges as well as nine ordinary citizens. The first trial that gave Dogan a lesser sentence was heard by five judges.READ MORE: Israel and Hamas will exchange hostages and prisoners after agreeing to a pause in the war in Gaza His lawyer, Jean-Marc Darrigade, said on Thursday (Friday AEST) Dogan won&#x27;t appeal again. \"He&#x27;s very tired and accepts the decision,\" he said.\"The extra year is more symbolic than anything else.\"The 50 other men convicted last December did not appeal the landmark verdict. They included Dominique Pelicot, Gisèle Pelicot&#x27;s ex-husband, who knocked her unconscious by lacing her food and drink with drugs and offered her to strangers he met online between 2011 and 2020, filming their assaults.Dogan was tried on charges of aggravated rape by administering substances that impair judgment or self-control — an offence punishable by up to 20 years in prison. The prosecutor in the appeal case asked for a 12-year sentence, French media reported from the courthouse in Nimes, southern France.\"One cannot, in 2025, think that because she said nothing, that she agreed. Because that kind of thinking belongs to another era!\" the prosecutor told the court, according to Le Monde newspaper.READ MORE: Men, boy, charged in Sydney over alleged &#x27;kill car&#x27; networkDogan had denied that he intended to rape Pelicot and argued that he was deceived by Dominique Pelicot.Dominique Pelicot was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to 20 years in prison, which was the maximum possible. He admitted his role and did not appeal.Sentences ranged from three to 15 years imprisonment for the other convicted men. One of them was convicted of drugging and raping his own wife with Dominique Pelicot&#x27;s help.The trial drew international attention after Gisèle Pelicot opposed a closed hearing, a demand made by several defendants. The court sided with her.Her courage inspired campaigners against sexual and sexist violence and the shocking case spurred a national reckoning over rape culture in France.READ MORE: WA road toll hits highest level in a decadeThe evidence included stomach-churning homemade videos of rapes and assaults that Dominique Pelicot filmed in the couple&#x27;s home in the small Provence town of Mazan and elsewhere.Civil proceedings in the southern French city of Avignon are due in November to settle damages owed to Gisèle Pelicot and her family, to be paid jointly by the convicted men.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
