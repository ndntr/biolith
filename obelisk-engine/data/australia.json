He said multiple people were killed but declined to say how many, referring to the nineteen missing as \"souls\" because officials were still speaking to family.\"There&#x27;s nothing to describe. It&#x27;s gone,\" Davis said of the plant.READ MORE: Putin praises Trump after failing to win the Nobel prize The blast occurred about 7:45am, Davis said, with aerial footage by WTVF-TV showing the smouldering hilltop facility and the burnt-out shells of vehicles.People reported hearing and feeling the explosion from kilometres away. The company&#x27;s website says it makes and tests explosives at an eight-building facility that sprawls across wooded hills in the Bucksnort area, about ninety-seven kilometres southwest of Nashville.Davis said investigators are trying to determine what happened and couldn&#x27;t say what caused the explosion.There&#x27;s no further danger of explosions, and the scene was under control Friday afternoon, according to Grey Collier, a spokesperson for the Humphreys County Emergency Management Agency.Emergency crews were initially unable to enter the plant because of continuing detonations, Hickman County Advanced EMT David Stewart said by phone. He didn&#x27;t have any details on casualties.Accurate Energetic Systems, based in nearby McEwen, did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment Friday morning.\"This is a tragedy for our community,\" McEwen Mayor Brad Rachford said in an email. He referred further comment to a county official.Residents in Lobelville, a twenty-minute drive from the scene, said they felt their homes shake and some people captured the loud boom of the explosion on their home cameras.The blast rattled Gentry Stover from his sleep.\"I thought the house had collapsed with me inside of it,\" he said by phone. \"I live very close to Accurate and I realised about thirty seconds after I woke up that it had to have been that.\"State Rep. Jody Barrett, a Republican from the neighbouring town of Dickson, was worried about the possible economic impact because the plant is a key employer in the area.\"We live probably 15 miles (24km) as the crow flies and we absolutely heard it at the house,\" Barrett said. \"It sounded like something going through the roof of our house.\"READ MORE: Palestinians return to what remains of their homes DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "RBA Governor Michele Bullock has hit back at suggestions from the Greens that the central bank is responsible for Australia&#x27;s skyrocketing house prices in a tense parliamentary hearing.In an appearance at Senate estimates this morning, Bullock was questioned by Greens senator Nick McKim about the Reserve Bank&#x27;s role in the housing crisis.\"The $400 billion that the RBA printed in the early year or two of COVID and effectively handed over to retail banks, who then turn around and lend it into the property market, do you accept that that played a role in the housing price bubble that we&#x27;ve seen over the last five years?\" McKim asked.READ MORE: Man arrested after woman&#x27;s death at Melbourne home \"Certainly part of the way monetary policy works is through the housing market, but I would not accept that the Reserve Bank is responsible for the housing price issues in this country,\" Bullock, who wasn&#x27;t appointed as governor until 2023, replied.When challenged on that by McKim, who put to her that the RBA \"doesn&#x27;t accept any responsibility whatsoever in the housing price spike\", Bullock pointed to an oft-cited factor as the genuine culprit.\"The problem is the lack of supply relative to demand, and when monetary policy eases and housing demand picks up, supply can&#x27;t pick up as quickly, and that&#x27;s where you end up,\" she said. \"But it&#x27;s not monetary policy&#x27;s responsibility to look after housing prices.\"READ MORE: Unusual customer heads to South Australia bottle shop&#x27;s beer fridge Having previously said that it would be at least two years before Australia started to see some relief from price surges, despite governments starting to focus on increasing supply, Bullock reiterated that fixing the country&#x27;s housing stock was a long, slow process.\"It takes time to get approvals and one of the big things is higher density housing and that by its nature takes much longer,\" she said.\"It is not something that you can just turn the switch and say &#x27;alright, now we&#x27;re off and running&#x27;, it really takes time.\"Bullock also frustrated McKim by telling him investors weren&#x27;t significantly exacerbating the housing crisis at the moment, and by refusing to be drawn on whether removing the capital gains tax discount for property would slow price rises.READ MORE: Pure chance saved fourth officer from being shot by Dezi Freeman: police \"I have done no particular analysis on what removal of the capital gains tax might do,\" she said.\"It&#x27;s (not) my job to tell the government what they should do with the policy,\" she added. However, when asked by Liberal senator Andrew Bragg about the impact of the federal government&#x27;s expanded first home guarantee scheme, Bullock said it was possible it would lead to house prices going \"a little higher\" in the short-term.But as for the medium-term impacts, she said that would depend on – you guessed it – supply.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
