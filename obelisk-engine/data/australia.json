attack.The changes come after a meeting of the National Security Committee and would see hate preachers targeted and the Home Affairs minister being granted the power to reject or cancel visas \"for those who spread hate and division in this country\".\"There is no place in Australia for antisemitism, it is an evil that tears at the fabric of our country,\" Albanese said in Canberra this morning.READ MORE: The five questions Australia is asking after the Bondi terror attack\"It puts the peaceful, free and equal society that we cherish at risk.\"The changes will build on a report antisemitism envoy Jillian Segal provided the federal government in July, which featured a 49-point plan.\"The Australian government adopts and fully supports the plan to combat antisemitism,\" Albanese said.\"We have already legislated for hate speech, hate crimes, hate symbols, outlawing doxing.\"We&#x27;ve already undertaken education action, including appointing the first-ever student ombudsman and the development of the envoy&#x27;s report card on universities.\"We&#x27;ll continue to work through the implementation of the 13 recommendations, in consultation with the Jewish community and the envoy.\"Of course, the first recommendation was the adoption of the IHRA (International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance) definition of antisemitism that the government adopted.\"READ MORE: Man charged over alleged antisemitic threats on flight from Bali to SydneyAlbanese announced five additional actions to build on the plan, including:Aggravated hate speech offence for preachers and leaders who promote violenceIncreased penalties for hate speech, promoting violenceMaking hate an aggravating factor in sentencing crimes for online threats and harassmentDeveloping a regime for listing organisations whose leaders engage in hate speech, promoting violence or racial hatredDeveloping a narrow federal offence for serious vilification based on race and or advocating racial supremacy.\"We have seen a series of appalling attacks targeting Australia&#x27;s Jewish community that culminated on Sunday in one of the worst acts of mass murder that this country has ever seen,\" Albanese said.\"The terrorist atrocity that killed 15 innocent people, including 10-year-old Matilda, who will be buried later today, was an attack on our Jewish community, but it was also an attack on the Australian way of life.\"Australians are shocked and angry, I am angry, it is clear we need to do more to combat this evil scourge, much more. \"Every Jewish Australian has the right to be proud of who they are and what they believe.\"Every Jewish Australian has the right to feel safe, valued and respected for the contribution that they make to our great nation.\"Segal described the terror attack as an \"unbelievable tragedy for the community\".\" I have been overwhelmed by support from members of the community, both here and from overseas, and from all other envoys around the world,\" she said.\"So we stand, I think, at a very important moment, not only for our community, but for fighting anti-Semitism around the world.\"This more formal response has been a long time coming, but of course it does build on a range of activities and work that started as soon as the report was delivered.\"Gonski to chair antisemitism education taskforceEducation Minister Jason Clare said David Gonski had agreed to lead a 12-month taskforce which will focus on ensuring the Australian education system prevents, tackles and properly responds to antisemitism.Gonski conducted the significant review into school funding in 2011.Clare will work alongside Segal, representatives from the states and territories and education regulators.READ MORE: How everyday Aussies can help in the wake of the Bondi shooting \"David Gonski is a towering Australian,\" Clare said.\"He understands the education system inside and out.\"I want to thank him from the bottom of my heart for agreeing to chair this taskforce, it will meet for the first time tomorrow morning.\"Clare said while the curriculum already contains Holocaust education, more needed to be done.\"There is more that we can do here to make sure that we embed in it an understanding of the evils of antisemitism, of the horrors of the Holocaust and the importance of Australian values,\" Clare said.\"In addition to that, there&#x27;s more work we can do in universities as well.\"The fact is, Jewish students have been made to feel unwelcome on campus.\"There are important things that we have already done like, for the first time ever, establishing a national student ombudsman and from next year, the special envoy report card work will commence.\"As I announced back in September next year, we&#x27;ll introduce legislation to increase the powers and the penalties available to the tertiary education regulator to enable them to act where universities don&#x27;t.\"READ MORE: Hero cop who took down Bondi shooter identifiedSegal said she felt \"encouraged\" by some of the \"medium-term actions\" that will take place over the next year in the education sector.\"I think they are incredibly important, we have to lay foundations for the future of the nation,\" she said.\"There will be ongoing work across all the sectors in the report longer term and my office will be engaged in many of them.\" Further search warrants AFP Commissioner Krissy Barrett said the NSW Joint Counter-Terrorism Team would execute further search warrants in the coming days to support its investigation into the attack.\"There is a lot of material to be examined and the AFP continues to work with both domestic and international partners to build a more complete picture of the movements and who the alleged offenders had contact
