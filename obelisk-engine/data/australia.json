          "content": "A surfer is in a critical condition and 20 beaches have been closed after a third shark attack at a Sydney beach in just over 24 hours.A man believed to be in his 20s was bitten on his leg at North Steyne Beach in Manly about 6.20pm today. A group pulled the man from the water and onto the sand and began first aid as they waited for emergency services to arrive.READ MORE: Jarren is hailed the &#x27;Indigenous Steve Irwin&#x27;, but the issue is he is not real Multiple emergency services, including paramedics, the intensive care ambulance, a helicopter and police, responded to the incident.The man was treated for serious leg injuries and taken to Royal North Shore Hospital in a critical condition.All 20 beaches on the Northern Beaches have been closed until further notice.This will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. It came hours after a suspected bull shark bit an 11-year-old boy&#x27;s surfboard also on Sydney&#x27;s Northern Beaches this morning, and another a 12-year-old boy was mauled at a beach in the city&#x27;s east yesterday.Authorities said a shark took an estimated 15-centimetre chunk out of the boy&#x27;s surfboard at the netted Dee Why Beach, near Dee Why Point, about 11.45am today.The boy, who was helped by lifesavers, managed to walk away from the close encounter unscathed.The NSW Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development said photo analysis of the bite mark suggested it was likely from a bull shark.Department crews, lifesavers and the local council were responding to the incident.Jet skis were patrolling the waters as a drone monitored the area from above.The incident came just a day after another suspected bull shark mauled a 12-year-old boy about 27 kilometres away near Shark Beach in Vaucluse, leaving him fighting for life at Sydney Children&#x27;s Hospital in Randwick.He suffered serious injuries to both legs and was pulled from the water by his friends and emergency services. The three shark attacks come after the city was battered by a storm and heavy rain, which caused runoff. Swimmers are advised to be careful, avoid the beaches, and stay clear of low-visibility and murky water.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

She said a failed defamation suit could bankrupt her family.9news.com.au has contacted the premier&#x27;s office for comment. Malinauskas had written to the former Adelaide Festival Board in support of removing Abdel-Fattah from the approaching Adelaide Writers&#x27; Week due to comments she had made about Zionists.In a social media post, the writer said Zionists had \"no claim or right to cultural safety\".Abdel-Fattah&#x27;s subsequent axing from the world-renowned event led to a mass exodus of 180 writers and saw the Adelaide Writers&#x27; Week director, former chair, and three board members resign.READ MORE: Suspected bull shark takes 15cm chunk out of boy&#x27;s surfboard day after teen mauledAdelaide Writers&#x27; Week was unable to go ahead and was scrapped for this year. All remaining board members resigned in the fallout, and a new board was established to repair reputational damage and restore trust.The new board has since apologised to Abdel-Fattah, invited her to next year&#x27;s event, and promised to uphold intellectual and artistic freedom.Malinauskas made the allegedly defamatory remark at a press conference last week, which Abdel-Fattah said had \"terrified\" her.He has repeatedly insisted he has acted in accordance with his conscience and what he believes is right.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
