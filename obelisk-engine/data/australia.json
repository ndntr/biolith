Officers are still searching for Baghsarian who relies on daily medication.His family have pleaded for the elderly grandfather to be released by his captors and police have set up Strike Force Chobat.Police say \"hope is fading\" of finding him alive.\"Distressing\" videos of him have been sent to police. Police are appealing to anyone who may have seen or heard anything relating to the kidnapping or witnessed any sort of suspicious activity in the Dural area to contact Crime Stoppers..NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
