Flanagan said police would have taken adequate action if any nearby children were at risk.The Baldivis property was sold to a new owner, who said they weren&#x27;t told of the former resident&#x27;s plans before they bought it.The extent of Forbes&#x27; planning was revealed in court. The judge told the court officers found nappies and children&#x27;s underwear and nearly 80,000 files of child exploitation material, many stored in a folder labelled \"X marks the spot\".Forbes&#x27; internet searches included \"volunteer childcare work near me\", \"how to build a panic room in the loft\", \"knockout chemicals and gases\" and \"how old can a child be left at home alone\".He also took photos of children using the cameras on his Tesla, which had windows fitted with pieces of dark-tinted perspex sheets and mapping history of various childcare centres across Perth.READ MORE: Why thousands of Aussie workers could be risking terminationForbes had tried to explain how his depraved internet searches were \"research\" for a novel he was writing, adding that he owned a fake police badge as he liked to dress up.The judge rejected all of this, saying he believed the electrician planned to follow through with the kidnap plot and sexual assault of a child.He pleaded guilty to multiple offences, including attempting to possess child-like sex dolls, using a carriage service to prepare or plan to engage in sexual activity with a child under 16, and possessing child exploitation material.The electrician was jailed for seven years and five months, due for parole in just under four years.READ MORE: Man detained, being questioned by police over US TV host&#x27;s missing mother Nancy GuthrieDetective Acting Superintendent David Palmer earlier said police were able to disrupt the offender&#x27;s actions before any child was physically harmed.\"Detectives from Child Exploitation Operations are putting offenders on notice. If you harm children, or if you are involved in child exploitation in any form, you will be found, you will be charged, you will face significant time in prison, and we will seize your assets,\" he said.\"This investigation is a clear example of early intervention preventing harm to children.\"Australian Border Force Commander Ranjeev Maharaj said the initial detection by the ABF of a child-like sex doll smuggled into Australia ended up uncovering a concerning number of additional crimes.Support is available from the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service at 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732)NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
