The teenager had not been using any drugs or alcohol, was not street racing and had not run a red light, he said.READ MORE: One state to swelter through the hottest day in over a year tomorrow\"This wasn&#x27;t a prolonged, intentional act. This is … a tragic outcome to a series of unfortunate events,\" Schmidt said.Police allege Papazoglu was speeding, although prosecutors were unsure what evidence supported that claim.Papazoglu, who is studying a business degree at university, appeared in court via video link from a police holding cell, wearing a hooded jumper.He sat silently with his head down as Magistrate Ray Plibersek read the facts about the case.His lawyer presented character references to the court, including from his mother, aunt, uncle and his employer at an after-school care centre.Plibersek noted Papazoglu&#x27;s \"excellent\" driving record and said he seemed to be a \"young man of good standing\" but knocked back his bail application due to the seriousness of the charges.\"It&#x27;s an absolutely tragic case,\" he said.\"It&#x27;s a terrible outcome for two families … the community&#x27;s heart goes out to (the victim&#x27;s) family for the tragic loss.\"Police had opposed bail due to the seriousness of the matter and said a prison sentence was likely if Papazoglu was convicted.Papazoglu&#x27;s matter will return to court on Tuesday for a mention, with a brief of evidence due by January 18.The magistrate asked Papazoglu if he understood what had happened in court.\"I just really want to see my family,\" Papazoglu replied.",

NSW and Queensland health authorities are using the recent cases of measles to remind the public, particularly children and those aged 60 or under, to ensure they are vaccinated against the preventable disease.
