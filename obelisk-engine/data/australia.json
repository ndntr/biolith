          "content": "The death toll in Hong Kong&#x27;s deadly high-rise fire has risen tgo 44 with hundreds still missing, while three men have been arrested.Hundreds of residents were evacuated as the blaze spread across seven of the eight buildings in a housing complex in Tai Po district, a suburb in the New Territories. At least 29 others remained hospitalised, seven in a critical condition. Bright flames and smoke shot out of windows as night fell.Of the 44 so far confirmed dead, 40 died at the scene and four in hospital, officials have said. The South China Morning Post has reported the fires are now under control in four buildings.READ MORE: $5 billion early Christmas gift could be on the cards for every AussieInvestigators will be looking into factors including whether material on the exterior walls of high-rise buildings met fire resistance standards, as the rapid spread of the fire was unusual, authorities said.The three men arrested in relation to the fire at an apartment complex in Hong Kong are two directors and a consultant of a construction company, officials said at a press conference early Thursday morning local time.Police are accusing the men of \"gross negligence.\"Police found the construction company name on inflammable polystyrene boards that firefighters found blocking some windows at the apartment complex.Officials added that they suspect other construction materials found at the apartments - including protective nets, canvas, and plastic covers - failed to meet safety standards.Officials earlier said the fire started on the external scaffolding of one of the buildings, a 32-storey tower, and later spread to inside the building and then to nearby buildings, likely aided by windy conditions.\"Police and the Fire Services Department have already set up a dedicated investigation team to investigate\" the fire and its cause, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said. The probe includes whether criminal elements are involved.Fire chiefs said high temperatures at the scene made it difficult for crews to mount rescue operations. It was not immediately known how the fire started.The raging fire sent up a column of flames and thick smoke as it spread quickly on bamboo scaffolding and construction netting that had been set up around the exterior of the housing complex.READ MORE: Man charged after greyhounds die in bike locker in Sydney\"Unusual\" elements contributing to the rapid spread of the fire have been detected, the South China Morning Post reports.Hong Kong Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung Yan-kin said styrofoam was found inside the burning buildings, which helped enable the blaze to expand quickly.Secretary for Security Chris Tang said early investigations deemed the quick spread of the fire suspicious.\"We have found that on the relevant building walls, the netting and waterproof tarpaulin material, once burned, showed spreading of the flames faster than [they should on] regulated materials. This is unusual,\" Tang said.He confirmed a criminal probe would take place alongside an investigation by firefighters.Records show the housing complex consisted of eight blocks with almost 2000 apartments housing about 4800 people.About 900 people were evacuated to temporary shelters.Multiple buildings close to each other were set ablaze, with bright flames and smoke shooting out of windows as night fell. Authorities said that hundreds of firefighters, police officers and paramedics were deployed. Firefighters aimed water at the intense flames from high up on ladder trucks.The blaze, which started mid-afternoon, was upgraded a level 5 alarm — the highest level of severity — as night fell. Authorities said that conditions remained very challenging for firefighters.\"Debris and scaffolding of the affected buildings (is) falling down,\" Derek Armstrong Chan, deputy director of Fire Service operations, said.READ MORE: Chilling threats over fake one-star Google reviewsTemperatures are scorching hot inside Wang Fuk Court as the fire rages on, preventing firefighters from reaching the upper floors of some buildings, where residents are still trapped.Addressing those stuck inside the burning buildings, Chan urged residents to close their doors and windows, and seal them with tape and wet napkins.Firefighters know where people are trapped, he said. \"However, due to extreme heat inside the specific buildings, we are currently unable to reach upward to those trapped inside,\" Chan continued, adding: \"We will keep going and keep trying.\"Officials said the fire started at the external scaffolding of one of the buildings, a 32-storey tower, and later spread to inside the building and also to nearby buildings, likely aided by windy conditions.The fire department said that it received \"numerous\" calls requesting assistance. It said some residents remained trapped as of Wednesday night, but police declined to provide details about how many were missing or in danger.Firefighters deployed 128 fire trucks and 57 ambulances to the scene.READ MORE: One dead, 100,000 without power after wild stormsThe dead included a 37-year-old firefighter, while another received treatment for heat exhaustion, Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung said.Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Wednesday expressed condolences to the firefighter who died and extended sympathies to the families of the victims, according to state broadcaster CCTV. He also urged efforts to minimise casualties and losses.District officials in Tai Po have opened temporary shelters for people left homeless by the fire.\"I&#x27;ve given up thinking about my property,\" a resident who only provided her surname, Wu, told local TV station TVB.\"Watching it burn like that was really frustrating.\"Tai Po is a suburban area in the New Territories, in the northern part of Hong Kong and near the border with the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen.Bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in Hong Kong at building construction and renovation projects, though the government said earlier this year that it would start phasing it out for public projects because of safety concerns.The fire is the most deadly in Hong Kong in years. In November 1996, 41 people died in a commercial building in Kowloon in a level 5 fire that lasted for around 20 hours.Lee said the government had suspended its campaigning efforts ahead of an upcoming December 7 election, according to the South China Morning Post.But he said a decision on whether to postpone the election would be made in the coming days, with the fire disaster taking top priority.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Patrick Morrisey.Morrisey earlier said that the guardsmen were believed to be dead, but then said on social media that there were \"conflicting reports\" about their conditions.The shooting occurred in downtown Washington, DC, on Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the early reports and a law enforcement official.READ MORE: Residents &#x27;trapped&#x27; as Hong Kong high-rise fire death toll rises The two National Guardsmen engaged in gunfire with the suspected shooter prior to being shot, according to two law enforcement sources. The sources said the suspect was detained and transported away from the scene on a stretcher.Law enforcement officials are not tracking any other victims of Wednesday&#x27;s shooting beyond the two National Guard officers and the suspect, according to a source familiar with the investigation.DC Metropolitan Police said on X that the scene is secure and one suspect is in custody. They advised people to avoid the area.READ MORE: Woman dead, man in hospital after shark attack at NSW beachA woman who was near the scene of the shooting told CNN she heard gunshots and then saw a \"bunch of people\" administering CPR to people who were on the ground.The circumstances of the shooting are not immediately clear.Joint Task Force — DC, the National Guard office responsible for organising the Guard mission to Washington, DC, confirmed in a statement that \"several\" of its members \"were involved in a shooting near the Farragut West Metro Station,\" adding that it is working with DC police and other \"law enforcement agencies.\"President Donald Trump was briefed on the shooting and weighed in on the incident on Truth Social.\"The animal that shot the two National Guardsmen … is also severely wounded, but regardless, will pay a very steep price,\" the president said in the post.Vice President JD Vance, during remarks at an event in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, called for prayers for the national guardsmen, who he said were in critical condition at the time.The shooting is \"a somber reminder that soldiers whether they&#x27;re active duty, reserve or National Guard are soldiers are the sword and the shield of the United States of America,\" Vance added.National Guard troops from multiple states have been in Washington, DC, for months as part of President Donald Trump&#x27;s anti-crime crackdown in the nation&#x27;s capital, which has since expanded to other cities across the country.Trump mobilised the National Guard in August and the troops were authorised to conduct law enforcement activities.CNN exclusively reported last month that National Guard troops will remain mobilised in the city at least through February.However, last week a federal judge halted the mobilisation of the National Guard in Washington, DC, ruling that Trump and the Defence Department illegally deployed the troops.In her ruling, the judge said there were \"more than 2000 National Guard troops\" every day in the city.The judge did not immediately order the National Guard to leave the city, allowing the Trump administration some time to file an appeal.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
