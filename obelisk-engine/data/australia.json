          "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday that he will meet over the weekend with US President Donald Trump in Florida.Zelenskyy told journalists that the two leaders will discuss security guarantees for Ukraine during Sunday&#x27;s talks, and that the 20-point plan under discussion \"is about 90% ready\".The announced meeting is the latest development in an extensive US-led diplomatic push to end the nearly four-year Russia-Ukraine war, but efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv.READ MORE: Police chase comes to crashing end after alleged ram-raid \"A lot can be decided before the New Year,\" Zelenskyy wrote on X earlier in the day, before announcing details of the meeting.Zelenskyy&#x27;s comments came after he said on Thursday that he had a \"good conversation\" with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump&#x27;s son-in-law.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday that the Kremlin had already been in contact with US representatives since Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev met with US envoys in Florida over the weekend.\"It was agreed upon to continue the dialogue,\" he said.Trump has unleashed a diplomatic push to end Russia&#x27;s all-out war, which began on February 24, 2022, but his efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv.Zelenskyy said on Tuesday that he would be willing to withdraw troops from Ukraine&#x27;s eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end the war, if Russia also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarised zone monitored by international forces.Though Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday that there had been \"slow but steady progress\" in the peace talks, Russia has given no indication that it will agree to any kind of withdrawal from land it has seized.In fact, Moscow has insisted that Ukraine relinquish the remaining territory it still holds in the Donbas — an ultimatum that Ukraine has rejected. Russia has captured most of Luhansk and about 70 per cent of Donetsk — the two areas that make up the Donbas.On the ground, one person was killed and three others were wounded when a guided aerial bomb hit a house in Ukraine&#x27;s Zaporizhzhia region, while six people were wounded in a missile strike on the city of Uman, local officials said on Friday.Russian drone attacks on the city of Mykolaiv and its suburbs overnight into Friday left part of the city without power. Energy and port infrastructure were damaged by drones in the city of Odesa on the Black Sea.Meanwhile, Ukraine said that it struck a major Russian oil refinery on Thursday using UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles.Ukraine&#x27;s General Staff said that its forces hit the Novoshakhtinsk refinery in Russia&#x27;s Rostov region.\"Multiple explosions were recorded. The target was hit,\" it wrote on Telegram.Rostov regional Gov. Yuri Slyusar said that a firefighter was wounded when extinguishing the fire.Ukraine&#x27;s long-range drone strikes on Russian refineries aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion.Russia wants to cripple the Ukraine&#x27;s power grid, seeking to deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Ukrainian officials say is an attempt to \"weaponise winter.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

To do that, two more cranes have been brought in to dismantle it but right now it&#x27;s still too windy to start the job... and it might not die down until 5am tomorrow.\"If we look at the wind patterns, it&#x27;s not favourable for at least the next two days,\" Venz said.The Broadwater Tourist Park said online that the storm \"resembled worse than anything we saw during Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred\".Broncos legend Corey Parker and his radio personality wife Margaux were camping at the part with their family, one of the many devastated by the destruction.\"We&#x27;ve lost caravan awnings and gazebos, our car&#x27;s been damaged, our caravan&#x27;s been damaged, but you know we&#x27;re all well and safe,\" Margaux said.When the storm hit, mother and daughter Elissa and Shayla were hiding behind their car as a neighbour&#x27;s boat came flying towards them.\"We hunkered down behind the wheel, my thinking was if the boat did come at us we were safe behind the car,\" Elissa told 9News.Shayla added: \"There were poles flying everywhere, hitting us a bit, it was terrifying, so we just were like its safer to get out of this kind of area.\"Tonight, what remains inside the no-go zone will stay there until the police exclusion lifts.For the dozens impacted they&#x27;re being offered accommodation.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "The Australian government has thrown its support behind the United States&#x27; strike on ISIS terrorists in Nigeria.President Donald Trump said that the US launched a \"powerful and deadly\" strike against Islamic State forces in Nigeria, after spending weeks accusing the West African country&#x27;s government of failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.In a Christmas evening post on his social media site, Trump did not provide details or mention the extent of the damage caused by the strikes. READ MORE: Huge clean-up begins after thousands descend onto Coogee Beach for pop-up party https://x.com/DeptofWar/status/2004351717131903272A Defence Department official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss details not made public, said the US worked with Nigeria to carry out the strikes, and that they had been approved by that country&#x27;s government.Nigeria&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the cooperation included exchange of intelligence and strategic coordination in ways \"consistent with international law, mutual respect for sovereignty and shared commitments to regional and global security\".Trump said the airstrikes were launched against Islamic State militants \"who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians\".Residents and security analysts have said Nigeria&#x27;s security crisis affects both Christians, predominant in the south, and Muslims, who are the majority in the north.\"Terrorist violence in any form, whether directed at Christians, Muslims or other communities, remains an affront to Nigeria&#x27;s values and to international peace and security,\" Nigeria&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the government supported the US-Nigerian cooperation on ISIS and the latest attack.https://x.com/SenatorWong/status/2004385096791740739\"ISIS terrorises people around the world. Its extremist, violent ideology must be stopped,\" she said in a statement.Smartraveller warns Australians to reconsider their overall need to travel to Nigeria due to the volatile security situation and the high risk of terrorism, kidnapping, violent crime and the risk of civil unrest.The warning is elevated to\"do not travel\" in several parts of Nigeria, including Anambra, Borno, Delta, Niger and Kogi.Nigeria is battling multiple armed groups, including at least two affiliated with the Islamic State — an offshoot of the Boko Haram extremist group known as the Islamic State West Africa Province in the northeast, and the less-known Lakurawa group prominent in the northwestern states like Sokoto where the gangs use large swathes of forests connecting states as hideouts.Security analysts said the target of the US strikes could be the Lakurawa group, which in the last year has increasingly become lethal in the region, often targeting remote communities and security forces.\"Lakurawa is a group that is actually controlling territories in Nigeria, in Sokoto state and in other states like Kebbi,\" said Malik Samuel, a Nigerian security researcher at Good Governance Africa.\"In the northwest, there has been the incursion of violent extremist groups that are ideologically driven,\" he said, blaming the incursion on the near absence of the state and security forces in hot spots.Nigeria&#x27;s government has previously said in response to Trump&#x27;s criticisms that people of many faiths, not just Christians, have suffered attacks at the hands of extremists groups.READ MORE: Police release details of arson suspect after car with Hanukkah signage firebombedTrump ordered the Pentagon last month to begin planning for potential military action in Nigeria to try and curb the so-called Christian persecution.The State Department recently announced it would restrict visas for Nigerians and their family members involved in killing Christians there.And the US recently designated Nigeria a \"country of particular concern\" under the International Religious Freedom Act.Trump said the US defence officials had \"executed numerous perfect strikes, as only the United States is capable of doing\" and added that \"our Country will not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper\".Nigeria&#x27;s population of 220 million is split almost equally between Christians and Muslims.The country has long faced insecurity from various fronts including the Boko Haram extremist group, which seeks to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law and has also targeted Muslims it deems not Muslim enough.But attacks in Nigeria often have varying motives.There are religiously motivated ones targeting both Christians and Muslims, clashes between farmers and herders over dwindling resources, communal rivalries, secessionist groups and ethnic clashes.The US security footprint has diminished in Africa, where military partnerships have either been scaled down or cancelled.US forces likely would have to be drawn from other parts of the world for any larger-scale military intervention in Nigeria.Trump has nonetheless kept up the pressure as Nigeria faced a series of attacks on schools and churches in violence that experts and residents say targets both Christians and Muslims.Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth posted yesterday night on X: \"The President was clear last month: the killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria (and elsewhere) must end.\"Hegseth said US military forces are \"always ready, so ISIS found out tonight — on Christmas\" and added, \"More to come…Grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation\" before signing off, \"Merry Christmas!\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
