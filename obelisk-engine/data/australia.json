The board is now run by chair Judy Potter and members Rob Brookman, Jane Doyle, John Irving and Adelaide Council representative Mary Couros.In a separate statement, Potter also apologised to Adelaide Writers&#x27; Week&#x27;s former director, Louise Adler, who resigned over the previous board&#x27;s decision on January 8 to go over her head and cancel Abdel-Fattah&#x27;s appearance.More than 180 writers — including former New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern and Booker Prize-shortlisted British author Zadie Smith — withdrew from the event in protest, and five senior members of Adelaide Writers&#x27; Week and the Adelaide Festival Board resigned.

          "content": "Opposition Leader Sussan Ley has blasted Prime Minister Anthony Albanese&#x27;s hate speech and gun control laws as \"unsalvageable\" as she confirms the Coalition will fight proposed federal legislation in the wake of the Bondi Beach terror attack.The PM earlier today accused the opposition of \"playing politics\" after a number of its MPs indicated they won&#x27;t support the reforms when they are introduced to parliament following an early recall.In response, Ley criticised the reforms and said the opposition will counter the proposed laws with different measures to combat antisemitism in the arts, education and broader society.READ MORE: Full list of 75 countries where Trump is freezing immigrant visas \"The opposition will continue to scrutinise this legislation carefully, but from what we have seen so far, it looks pretty unsalvageable,\" Ley said during a press conference in Canberra.\"As it stands, the government&#x27;s proposal is half-baked and Australians deserve far better.\"Ley&#x27;s said the opposition&#x27;s reform package would focus on enshrining a definition of \"antisemitism\" in law.She again claimed the PM&#x27;s proposed measures do not address the root issue of the Bondi attack.\"We have got this bundle of measures heading in many different directions, criticised in a very valid way by a whole range of people, but not actually addressing the issue,\" Ley added.\"Let&#x27;s remember why we are where we are. We had the worst-ever Australian attack on Australian soil.\"Parliament should have been reconvened before Christmas to actually demonstrate leadership, compassion and the determination that I have spoken of every day since to tackle radical Islamic extremism and eradicate antisemitism.\"READ MORE: Arrest warrant issued over Queensland support worker&#x27;s deathParliament will reconvene early next week to consider the proposed legislation, the draft of which was presented to MPs and senators on Monday.The government has said the updates would allow for swifter crackdowns on the kind of speech which Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke has characterised as heretofore antisocial but not illegal. However, despite many Coalition MPs condemning Albanese for not acting sooner in the wake of the December 14 attack, some senior figures are now baulking at supporting the proposed bill.Among them is leadership aspirant Andrew Hastie, citing a perceived threat to \"democratic freedoms\", including freedom of speech.\"There&#x27;s a lot to consider, and very little time in which to do so,\" he said in a video posted to social media.\"From the top, I&#x27;ll be voting no to this bill. \"READ MORE: The last Russia-US nuclear treaty is about to end. What lies ahead? READ MORE: Major hint Trump is about to unleash new military operation Former Nationals member turned One Nation star recruit Barnaby Joyce is also opposed to the bill, though he specifically rejects the need for gun control reform rather than hate speech crackdowns.\"There was no recreational shooter that went down and mass murdered people at Bondi,\" he told Today.\"But somehow we&#x27;ve got wrapped up this. \"Joyce said \"fundamentalist Islam\" was the issue that needed to be addressed, blaming immigration – though one of the alleged Bondi terrorists was Australian-born. Nationals Senator Bridget McKenzie has also decried the gun control aspects of the bill, which would limit firearm ownership and establish a gun buyback scheme. Albanese hit out at the Coalition this morning, accusing its MPs of hypocrisy. \"This is somewhat stunning, frankly. The Coalition, day after day, very clearly called for parliament to be recalled,\" he told ABC Radio Sydney.\"Now they&#x27;re saying this is somehow rushed, even though my government has moved in a considered, orderly way.\"Albanese said he had met with Ley regularly in the lead-up to recalling parliament, and that the government was very open to considering amendments. \"We&#x27;ve said we&#x27;re open to amendments in order to be sure to get this right,\" he said.\"We haven&#x27;t heard any proposed amendments.\"He urged MPs with concerns or proposed changes to \"pick up the phone\" and \"engage constructively\". \"I&#x27;ll just say to the Coalition, this should be a moment of national unity, and I say that to the crossbenchers and Greens as well,\" he said.With the Coalition set to oppose the bill in parliament, the government would likely need to reach an agreement with the Greens to push the legislation through the Senate.The other option would be making alterations to reach a stage where the Coalition could support both the hate speech and gun control laws. 9news.com.au has contacted the prime minister&#x27;s office and attorney-general&#x27;s office for comment.
