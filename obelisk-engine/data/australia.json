          "content": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has blasted opposition MPs who have indicated they won&#x27;t support the government&#x27;s hate speech and gun control law reforms, accusing the Coalition of \"playing politics\" in the wake of the Bondi Beach terror attack.Parliament will reconvene early next week to consider the proposed legislation, the draft of which was presented to MPs and senators on Monday.The government has said the updates would allow for swifter crackdowns on the kind of speech which Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke has characterised as heretofore antisocial but not illegal.READ MORE: Arrest warrant issued over Queensland support worker&#x27;s death However, despite many Coalition MPs condemning Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for not acting sooner in the wake of the December 14 attack, some senior figures are now balking at supporting the proposed bill.Among them is leadership aspirant Andrew Hastie, citing a perceived threat to \"democratic freedoms\", including freedom of speech.\"There&#x27;s a lot to consider, and very little time in which to do so,\" he said in a video posted to social media.READ MORE: The last Russia-US nuclear treaty is about to end. What lies ahead? \"From the top, I&#x27;ll be voting no to this bill. \"The Coalition has previously opposed the idea of stronger hate speech laws, though the party has yet to take a formal stance on the current draft bill. Former Nationals member turned One Nation star recruit Barnaby Joyce is also opposed to the bill, though he specifically rejects the need for gun control reform rather than hate speech crackdowns.READ MORE: Major hint Trump is about to unleash new military operation \"There was no recreational shooter that went down and mass murdered people at Bondi,\" he told Today.\"But somehow we&#x27;ve got wrapped up this. \"Joyce said \"fundamentalist Islam\" was the issue that needed to be addressed, blaming immigration – though one of the alleged Bondi terrorists was Australian-born. Nationals Senator Bridget McKenzie has also decried the gun control aspects of the bill, which would limit firearm ownership and establish a gun buyback scheme. Albanese hit out at the Coalition this morning, accusing MPs of hypocrisy. \"This is somewhat stunning, frankly. The Coalition, day after day, very clearly called for parliament to be recalled,\" he told ABC Radio Sydney.\"Now they&#x27;re saying this is somehow rushed, even though my government has moved in a considered, orderly way.\"Albanese said he had met with opposition leader Sussan Ley regularly in the lead-up to recalling parliament, and that the government was very open to considering amendments. \"We&#x27;ve said we&#x27;re open to amendments in order to be sure to get this right,\" he said.\"We haven&#x27;t heard any proposed amendments.\"He urged MPs with concerns or proposed changes to \"pick up the phone\" and \"engage constructively\". \"I&#x27;ll just say to the Coalition, this should be a moment of national unity, and I say that to the crossbenchers and Greens as well,\" he said.Should the Coalition broadly oppose the bill in parliament, the government could need to reach an agreement with the Greens, to push the legislation through the Senate.The other option would be making alterations to reach a stage where the Coalition could support both the hate speech and gun control laws. 9news.com.au has contacted the prime minister&#x27;s office and attorney-general&#x27;s office for comment.

          "standfirst": "A train travelling north from Bangkok was derailed when a construction crane fell onto a carriage as it was passing through Ban Thanon Khot in Nakhon Ratchasima.",
          "content": "A construction crane crashed onto a moving passenger train in north-eastern Thailand on Wednesday, triggering a derailment that killed at least 32 people and injured dozens more.The crash occurred in Nakhon Ratchasima, some 200 kilometers northeast of Bangkok, on a section of a planned high-speed rail project that is intended to eventually connect China with much of Southeast Asia.The province&#x27;s Public Health Provincial Office said there were 32 fatalities and 64 injured victims, including seven with severe injuries. READ MORE: Donald Trump flips off, appears to swear at hecklerThere were still three passengers missing among the 171 believed to have been on board the train, it said in a statement issued as night fell.Authorities said the crane was being used to build an elevated part of the railway when it fell as the train was travelling from the capital, Bangkok, to Ubon Ratchathani province. Thailand&#x27;s Rail Transport Department said the crane was what is called a launching gantry crane, a self-supporting structure with vertical legs that usually runs on rails or wheels for mobility, allowing it to progress along with the construction project that it straddles. Such cranes are often used to help build elevated roads.Images published in Thai media showed plumes of white, then dark, smoke rising from the crash site, with construction equipment dangling from girders between two concrete support pillars.Rescue workers pull survivors from mangled, overturned carriagesRescue workers stood on top of overturned railway carriages, some of them with gaping holes torn on their sides, video from public broadcaster ThaiPBS showed. What appeared to be sections of the crane were scattered along the track.Samai Teechantuek, 62, whose house is about 100 meters from the site of the accident, told The Associated Press of the horror of witnessing the accident, and hearing \"the noises screeching, and then bam, bam, bam, all the way over there.\"\"When the dust settled, I saw the top of the train carriage. I heard people shouting &#x27;save the children first!&#x27;\" she said. \"A conductor pulled people out. I saw them pulling many people out. People from the shop over there also ran out to help.\"\"My legs were shaking. I was standing there shaking. I didn&#x27;t dare going any closer,\" she said.Transport Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn said he ordered an investigation.In August 2024, a railway tunnel on the planned route, also in Nakhon Ratchasima, collapsed, killing three workers. Days of heavy rainfall were believed to have been a factor in the collapse.The elevated segment that collapsed is a part of a Thai-Chinese high-speed railway project linking the capital to the northeastern province of Nong Khai, bordering Laos. The two-stage rail project has a total investment cost of more than 520 billion baht ($24.8 billion) and is associated with an ambitious plan to connect China with Southeast Asia under Beijing&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative. The section where the accident took place had a budget of more than 179 billion baht ($8.5 billion) and according to its original plans was expected to start operating in 2027.Anan Phonimdaeng, acting governor of the State Railway of Thailand, said the project&#x27;s contractor is Italian-Thai Development, with a Chinese company responsible for design and construction supervision. He said he ordered the contractor to suspend operations at the site until the investigation of the accident is completed.Anan said authorities will examine the responsibilities of both parties, and the Railway Department plans to take legal action against the contractor as a first step. Damage to the train was estimated to be more than 100 million baht ($4.8 million), while construction equipment suffered limited damage, he said.A statement posted on the company&#x27;s website expressed condolences to the victims and said the company would take responsibility for paying compensation to the families of the dead and hospitalisation expenses for the injured.The main contractor for the route&#x27;s first stage between Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima, Italian-Thai Development, was also the directly responsible for construction of the segment where Wednesday&#x27;s accident occurred.Main contractor was tied to last year&#x27;s Bangkok building collapseThe rail accident sparked outrage because the company, also known as Italthai, was also the co-lead contractor for the State Audit Building in the Thai capital Bangkok, which collapsed during construction in March during a major earthquake.About 100 people were killed in the collapse, which was the only major structure in Thailand to suffer such serious damage. Dozens of executives were indicted in connection with the disaster but none have yet been tried.The involvement of Chinese companies in both projects has also drawn attention, as has Italthai&#x27;s and Chinese companies&#x27; involvement in the construction of several expressway extensions in and around Bangkok where several accidents, some fatal, had occurred.Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, who was interior minister when the State Audit Building collapsed, said that the Comptroller General&#x27;s Department and Transport Ministry are responsible for blacklisting contractors, and the laws could not be amended in the brief time he was interior minister to expedite the matter.In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the government was aware of the reports about the accident and had expressed condolences.\"The Chinese government attaches great importance to the safety of projects and personnel, and we are also learning about the situation,\" she said. \"At present, it appears that the relevant section is being constructed by a Thai company, and the cause of the accident is still under investigation.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
