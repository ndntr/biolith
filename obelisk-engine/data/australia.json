Friends laid flowers at the site as police issued an urgent warning.\"This particular bike, though, is being sold as an e-trail bike. They can sell for over $10,000,\" Kylie Rigg from Queensland Police said.\"They can travel over 60 kilometres an hour, they are not bicycles.\"[Teens] do not have the skill level, they do not have the protective clothing to ride them.\"Investigators are probing if the rider was going too fast and police are appealing for witnesses. It&#x27;s the state&#x27;s second e-bike fatality this week after eight year-old Zeke Hondow was killed on the Sunshine Coast. There have been calls for a crackdown on e-bikes in the state.Legal e-bikes can be ridden on paths unless otherwise signed, as long as riders obey bicycle rules such as wearing a helmet.They must have a maximum continuous power output of 250 watts and be pedal-powered with motor assistance up to 25km/h.There are no age limits for riding e-bikes in Queensland. Bike motors with more than 250 watts are illegal, as are throttle-powered bikes without pedals, which are technically electric motorcycles and require registration, insurance and a licence and cannot be ridden on paths.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
