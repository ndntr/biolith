These are your consumer rights in AustraliaDober said Sewell&#x27;s serious role and \"initiating force\" in the camp attack could see him jailed for almost the 10-year maximum.Sewell&#x27;s barrister Dermot Dann KC argued it was unfair for Sewell to remain locked up when 14 co-accused had already been bailed.He said a trial might not happen for two years, and the maximum 10-year term for violent disorder was not \"in the realm\" of any sentence Sewell would be handed for his alleged role.Dann said any risk Sewell posed to the community could be ameliorated by bail conditions, including stopping him from coming into Melbourne&#x27;s centre and not contacting co-accused.Sewell&#x27;s fiancée Rebecca Konstantinou has put forward a $20,000 surety to secure his release on bail, which she said was funded from her own savings and from \"family and friends\".Justice Elliott agreed with the defence&#x27;s submissions as he approved Sewell&#x27;s release today.",

          "content": "The House passed a bill to end the US&#x27;s longest government shutdown, sending the measure to US President Donald Trump for his signature after a historic 43-day funding lapse that saw federal workers go without multiple paychecks, travellers stranded at airports and people lining up at food banks to get a meal for their families.House lawmakers made their long-awaited return to the nation&#x27;s capital this week after nearly eight weeks away.Republicans used their slight majority to pass the bill with a mostly party-line vote of 222-209.READ MORE: What emails show about Trump-Epstein linkThe Senate has already passed the measure.Democrats wanted to extend an enhanced tax credit that expires at the end of the year, which lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces.They refused to go along with a short-term spending bill that did not include that priority. But Republicans said that was a separate policy fight to be held at another time.\"We told you 43 days ago from bitter experience that government shutdowns don&#x27;t work,\" said the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Tom Cole.READ MORE: Watchdog flags safety concerns for children over pesticide sprayed on berries\"They never achieve the objective that you announce. And guess what? You haven&#x27;t achieved that objective yet, and you&#x27;re not going to.\"The shutdown magnified the stark partisan divisions within Congress, and that split screen was reflected when lawmakers debated the spending measure on the House floor.Republicans said Democrats sought to use the pain generated by the shutdown to prevail in a policy dispute.\"They knew it would cause pain, and they did it anyway,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said.Democrats said Republicans raced to pass tax breaks earlier this year that they say mostly will benefit the wealthy.But the bill before the House \"leaves families twisting in the wind with zero guarantee there will ever, ever be a vote to extend tax credits to help everyday people pay for their health care,\" said Jim McGovern.READ MORE: Missed out on seeing the aurora australis? You get one last chance tonightDemocratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats would not give up on the subsidy extension even if the vote did not go their way.\"This fight is not over,\" Jeffries said. \"We&#x27;re just getting started.\"The House had not been in legislative session since September 19, when it passed a short-term measure to keep the government open when the new budget year began in October.Johnson sent lawmakers home after that vote and put the onus on the Senate to act, saying House Republicans had done their job.The compromise to end the shutdownThe legislation included buy-in from eight senators who broke ranks with the Democrats after concluding that Republicans would not bend on using a government funding bill to extend the health care tax credits.Meanwhile, the shutdown&#x27;s toll was growing by the day.The compromise funds three annual spending bills and extends the rest of the government funding through January 30. Republicans promised to hold a vote by mid-December to expand the health care subsidies, but there is no guarantee of success.\"We had reached a point where I think a number of us believed that the shutdown had been very effective in raising the concern about health care,\" said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. The promise for a future vote \"gives us an opportunity to continue to address that going forward.\"The legislation includes a reversal of the firing of federal workers by the Trump administration since the shutdown began.READ MORE: Trump urges Israel to pardon Netanyahu, sparking concerns over US influenceIt also protects federal workers against further layoffs through January and guarantees they are paid once the shutdown is over.The bill for the Agriculture Department means people who rely on key food assistance programs will see those benefits funded without threat of interruption through the rest of the budget year.The package includes $US203.5 million ($310.3 million) to boost security for lawmakers and an additional $US28 million ($42.6 million) for the security of Supreme Court justices.Democrats are also seizing on language that would give senators the opportunity to sue when a federal agency or employee searches their electronic records without notifying them, allowing for up to $500,000 in potential damages for each violation. Democrats called for the removal of the provision.The language seems aimed at helping Republican senators pursue damages if their phone records were analysed by the FBI as part of an investigation into Trump&#x27;s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. The provisions drew criticism from Republicans as well.Johnson said he was \"very angry about it.\"\"That was dropped in at the last minute, and I did not appreciate that, nor did most of the House members,\" Johnson said, promising a vote on the matter as early as next week.The biggest point of contention, though, was the fate of the expiring enhanced tax credit that makes health insurance more affordable through Affordable Care Act marketplaces.\"It&#x27;s a subsidy on top of a subsidy. Our friends added it during COVID,\" Cole said.READ MORE: RnB star Akon arrested in US after missing court date\"COVID is over. They set a date certain that the subsidies would run out. They chose the date.\"Nancy Pelosi said the enhanced tax credit was designed to give more people access to health care, and no Republican voted for it.\"All they have done is try to eliminate access to health care in our country. The country is catching on to them,\" Pelosi said.Most Democrats call the passage of the spending bill this week a mistake.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York, who received blowback from his party in March when he voted to keep the government open, said the bill \"fails to do anything of substance to fix America&#x27;s healthcare crisis.\"Without the enhanced tax credit, premiums on average will more than double for millions of Americans. More than 2 million people would lose health insurance coverage altogether next year, the Congressional Budget Office projected.Bernie Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats, said giving up the fight was a \"horrific mistake.\" Chris Murphy agreed, saying that voters who overwhelmingly supported Democrats in last week&#x27;s elections were urging them to \"hold firm.\"Health care debate aheadIt&#x27;s unclear whether the parties will find any common ground on health care before the December vote in the Senate.Johnson has said he will not commit to bringing it up in his chamber.Some Republicans have said they are open to extending the COVID-19 pandemic-era tax credits, as premiums will soar for millions of people, but they also want new limits on who can receive the subsidies.Some argue that the tax dollars for the plans should be routed through individuals rather than going directly to insurance companies.Senator Susan Collins, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Monday that she was supportive of extending the tax credits with changes, such as new income caps. Some Democrats have signalled they could be open to that idea.House Democrats expressed great scepticism that the Senate effort would lead to a breakthrough.Republican Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said Republicans have wanted to repeal the health overhaul for the past 15 years. \"That&#x27;s where they&#x27;re trying to go,\" she said.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Australia&#x27;s pesticide regulator has flagged fresh health concerns for young children over a chemical sprayed on berries.With their high nutritional content, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries have become a favourite for families as part of healthier diets.But the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) says existing regulations over using dimethoate - an insecticide widely used to stop berries being spoiled by fruit fly - need strengthening to keep people safe.READ MORE: Storms to hammer Australia from top of NT to bottom of SAIn a decision announced this week, the national watchdog said children aged between two and six years old who ate berries treated with dimethoate within seven days or less of harvest risked exposure of the chemical beyond safe limits.The APVMA ruled fruit growers must now wait at least 14 days after applying the pesticide before harvesting to give it more time to degrade.It said existing label directions needed altering to ensure dimethoate&#x27;s use on berries did not present \"an undue hazard to people\".Until now, growers had to wait one day after spraying blueberries and seven days following the treatment of raspberries and blackberries. Earlier this year, the APVMA began reviewing potential health hazards from dimethoate amid the growing popularity of berries.Data from Food Standards Australia and New Zealand showed Australians&#x27; consumption of blueberries, blackberries and raspberries has jumped since the last review of the pesticide in 2017.Health concerns over dimethoate resulted in European Union countries banning the chemical in 2019.Industry body Berries Australia told 9news.com.au that figures it collected over the past five years showed dimethoate usage had fallen.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
