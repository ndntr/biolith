          "content": "The Australian economy has grown at 0.6 per cent in the last quarter, and by 1.8 per cent annually, driven by rising household and government spending.The figures published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) today showed stronger activity than the 0.5 per cent quarterly growth that the Reserve Bank and economists had anticipated, following the weak 0.3 per cent results in the March quarter due to impacts from Tropical Cyclone Alfred.\"Economic growth rebounded in the June quarter following subdued growth in the March quarter, which was heavily impacted by weather events,\" ABS head of national accounts Tom Lay said. READ MORE: China displays military strength in a parade attended by Kim, PutinThe ABS said the 0.9 per cent rise in household spending and 1 per cent increase in government spending were the main drivers of the strong quarter.Household spending was lifted by Australians extending their holiday breaks from Easter to Anzac Day — which fell on the same week this year — end-of-financial-year sales, and increased demand for medical services due to the particularly strong flu season.\"End of financial year sales and new product releases contributed to rises in discretionary spending on goods including furnishings and household equipment, motor vehicles and recreation and culture goods,\" Lay said.\"Households took advantage of the proximity of Easter to Anzac Day to extend their holiday break, resulting in rises in discretionary services such as hotels, cafes and restaurants and recreation and culture services.\"Australians also bought more food as major supermarket chains, including Coles and Woolworths, increased their promotional sales.The Albanese government&#x27;s spending, excluding defence investments and including costs like holding the federal election in May, was the largest contributor to growth.READ MORE: Father calls for law change after driver who killed son walks free from courtHigh demand for health services also led to more spending on the Medicare Benefits Schedule and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.Trade also increased on the back of iron ore and LNG export rebound after the effects of severe weather in the March quarter.A rise in short-term visitors, particularly those visiting friends and family in Australia, led to an increase in service exports.Private investment remained relatively unchanged, increasing 0.1 per cent in the June quarter. The ABS said the largest detractor from growth was the 3.9 per cent decrease in public investment — the largest fall, excluding the COVID-19 period, since September 2017. This was due to state and territory governments spending less on transport and health infrastructure.Treasurer Jim Chalmers said today&#x27;s results were equal to the fastest quarterly growth in almost three years and the fastest annual growth rate in almost two years. \"Today&#x27;s National Accounts show Australia&#x27;s economy is gathering momentum in the face of global economic uncertainty,\" he said.READ MORE: Man&#x27;s body left undiscovered for 12 hours in front of Melbourne homeBut experts questioned the treasurer&#x27;s optimism. CreditorWatch chief economist Ivan Colhoun said the figures were largely driven by temporary factors like the weather events last quarter, federal election spending and end-of-financial-year sales.\"At face value, this outcome could be seen as confirming the RBA&#x27;s anticipated strengthening in economic growth, though I&#x27;m not so sure about that,\" he said.\"There was a host of special factors impacting the data this quarter, most of which acted to boost growth temporarily.\"Oxford Economics Australia head of macroeconomic forecasting Sean Langcake said while the results were \"encouraging confirmation\" that worse global uncertainty did not have a heavy toll on the economy, it may be a \"high watermark\" for growth this year.\"The June quarter benefited from a rebound from a soft first quarter, business and consumer confidence are still a little shaky, and the labour market appears to be cooling,\" he said.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping, speaking before a military parade to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, said humanity today must choose between peace and war and between dialogue and confrontation.Xi started a brief address by remembering the victims of the war and called for eradication of the roots of war to prevent history from repeating itself.But Xi&#x27;s main message was forward looking: today, China is strong, fears no one and is ready to take a leading role in the world.IN PICTURES: Daniel Andrews among guests at China parade \"The Chinese people are a people that are not afraid of violence and are self-reliant and strong,\" he said.At the same time, \"We will adhere to the path of peaceful development and work hand in hand with people of all countries to build a community with a shared future for mankind.\"The parade began after he spoke with troops marching in rhythmic lockstep, their boots echoing off the pavement, for a review by Xi, who is also head of China&#x27;s military as chairman of the Central Military Commission.The parade will showcase missiles, modern fighter jets and other military might as China seeks to wield greater influence on the global stage. Some of the military hardware is on public view for the first time.Before they started marching, Xi rode by the entire length of the formations along Beijing&#x27;s central Chang&#x27;an Avenue in a classic-style black limousine. He stood up through an opening in a roof with four microphones lined in front of him and greeted flanks of troops as he passed them and rows of missiles and military vehicles.They shouted back mottos in unison such as: \"We serve the people.\"Before Xi spoke, the ceremony began with an 80-gun artillery salute to mark the 80 years since the end of the war, followed by the national anthem, the March of the Volunteers, a song composed in 1935 during the early years of resistance against invading Japanese forces.Xi and his invited guests including Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un arrived earlier at the historic Tiananmen Gate to watch the parade. Xi shook hands individually with guests on a red carpet before they climbed the stairs up to the viewing platform overlooking Tiananmen Square.Putin and Kim flanked Xi as they made their way to the platform. They paused to shake hands with five WWII veterans, some older than 100.As the parade got underway, US President Donald Trump said on social media that the big question is whether Xi will recognise the contributions of Americans who fought in the war.He added: \"Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong-un, as you conspire against The United States of America.\"Xi, in his remarks, did not mention America by name but expressed his gratitude to foreign countries who helped China resist the Japanese invasion.Domestically, the commemoration of the anniversary is a way to show how far China has come. China was a major front in the war, a fact often overlooked in accounts that focus more on the fight for Europe and US naval battles in the Pacific. READ MORE: Former Aussie premiers join &#x27;rogues&#x27; gallery&#x27; of dictators at Chinese military paradeA Japanese invasion before the war and the conflict itself killed millions of Chinese people.The military parade is also a show of strength to boost support for the Communist Party and its leader, Xi, domestically, and a way to portray itself as a global alternative to the American-dominated postwar era.\"The Chinese people&#x27;s rejuvenation cannot be blocked, and the noble goal of the peaceful development of human civilisation must triumph,\" Xi said at the end of his speech.The ceremony began with an 80-gun artillery salute to mark the 80 years since the end of the war, followed by the national anthem, the March of the Volunteers, a song composed in 1935 during the early years of resistance against Japanese forces in the country.A sea of people sat in clearly demarcated sections on the square across the wide avenue as the soldiers marched past. They waved small red flags as choirs sang patriotic songs including Defend the Yellow River and No New China without the Communist Party of China.",

He has shown he has a large group of followers who will attack on instruction.\"Pascoe referred to Sewell becoming \"erratic\" after shouting and interrupting a press conference of Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan yesterday.Sewell allegedly led a group of about 30 men dressed in black to storm the Indigenous camp on Sunday evening after attending an anti-immigration rally in the city centre.\"The applicant turned back to the National Socialist Network group and incites the group, by instructing them to charge towards Camp Sovereignty,\" Pascoe said.READ MORE: Australia&#x27;s economic growth beats expectationsMembers of the network held down occupants of the camp and began to kick them, he said.The detective described Camp Sovereignty as \"a First Nations refuge\" and said another person was struck with a pole, kicked and punched by members of the network.The incident injured three people, with the worst suffered by a woman who required staples in her scalp to close a wound, the court was told.Nathan Bull, 23, and a 20-year-old from Ardeer have been charged with violent disorder, affray and other offences following the incident, but they were bailed by police last night.Sewell had also been arrested and interviewed over an incident on August 9, for which he has been charged with assault and committing an offence while on bail, Pascoe said.He and a large group of members from his group participated in a march through Melbourne&#x27;s city centre and then assaulted a man, the detective said.Sewell&#x27;s lawyer, interstate solicitor Mathew Hopkins, appeared by video link to ask the magistrate to bail his client.He claimed prosecutors were only using the August 9 incident to \"bolster\" their argument to deny bail and were intertwining their evidence with a \"political attack\" on his client.READ MORE: Major Australian university&#x27;s plans to slash jobs halted by safety watchdogIn the earlier incident, Sewell was acting in self-defence as the other man had hit him first, Hopkins said.Sewell never missed a court hearing, was committed to fighting all charges and he needed to be released to help his wife and children return from a holiday in Queensland, he said.Magistrate Donna Bakos will hand down her bail decision on Friday afternoon.Sewell appeared in another courtroom after his bail application for a contested hearing over intimidation offences, a matter that had been cut short because of his arrest yesterday afternoon.Magistrate Michelle Hodgson said she was aware he was in custody but would like to continue the hearing, which began on Monday.\"I would like to continue,\" Sewell said, representing himself.Prosecutor Melissa Mahady said witnesses were on standby and agreed to proceed, with Sewell asking to get access to his legal documents.For 24/7 crisis support run by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, contact 13YARN (13 92 76).",
