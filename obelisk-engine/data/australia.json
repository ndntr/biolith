Acting Superintendent Stephen Parry alleged Mintzas was firing shots \"indiscriminately\" at passing cars from the window of his unit above a business, injuring more than a dozen people and hitting several cars.READ MORE: Masked attackers set UK mosque on fire with people insideThere are a number of restaurants, small businesses, a church, and a vet nearby.

Mintzas was also taken to hospital with minor injuries after glass smashed and shattered around his eye, and has since been released.

His employment status is now under review pending the outcome of the investigation.Parry said Mintzas is a father with very little history with police. He said he does not have a firearms license and does not have any links to terror, organised crime or mental health issues.\"He&#x27;s a 60-year-old male who does have a couple of children and has very few recorded interactions with the police over the last 20 years,\" he said.Mintzas &#x27; family has been notified. Detectives are currently questioning Mintzas to determine his motives and how he allegedly obtained the gun.Parry said he is speaking \"freely\" with officers. \"My 35 years in the police, there&#x27;s been very few instances of this nature where somebody is randomly targeting people in the street driving past in vehicles,\" he said.READ MORE: Thieves swipe Pokémon cards worth over $20,000 from vending machine At least 16 people injured A total of 13 cars, including two police vehicles, and a nearby bus shelter were shot at with bullets shattering through the glass.At least 16 people suffered minor injuries.Three people were taken to hospital, including a man who was shot in the neck while he was in the backseat of a car with his family.His family drove him to hospital, and he has since undergone surgery. \"My understanding is that the injuries are not life-threatening and he is expected to survive thankfully,\" Parry said.Two other people who were hospitalised have since been released.No police officers were injured.Parry said that it was \"incredible\" that no one was killed and, if not for the response by police, the situation could have been \"a whole lot worse\".
