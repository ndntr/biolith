Banksy posted a photo of the work on Instagram, his usual method of claiming a work as authentic.READ MORE: Appeals court upholds $126 million defamation judgment against President Trump It was captioned “Royal Courts Of Justice. London.”Security officials outside the courthouse covered the artwork with sheets of black plastic and two metal barriers, and it was being guarded by two officers and a security camera.Because the Victorian gothic revival style building is 143 years old, the mural will be removed with consideration for its historical significance, according to HM Courts and Tribunals.“The Royal Courts of Justice is a listed building and HMCTS are obliged to maintain its original character,” it said in a statement. Listed buildings are considered the country’s most significant historic buildings and sites and are protected by law.READ MORE: Woman accused of murdering children, leaving their bodies in luggage on trial While the artwork doesn&#x27;t refer to a particular cause or incident, activists saw it as a reference to the UK government&#x27;s ban on the group Palestine Action. On Saturday almost 900 people were arrested at a London protest challenging the ban.Defend Our Juries, the group that organised the protest, said in a statement that the mural “powerfully depicts the brutality unleashed” by the government ban.“When the law is used as a tool to crush civil liberties, it does not extinguish dissent, it strengthens it,” the statement said.The courts have weighed in on the Palestine Action case, with judges initially rejecting the organisation’s request to appeal its ban. A High Court court judge then allowed the appeal to go forward, though the government is now challenging that decision.Banksy began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world’s best-known artists. His paintings and installations sell for millions of dollars at auction and have drawn thieves and vandals.Banksy’s work often comments on political issues, with many of his pieces criticizing government policy on migration and war.At the Glastonbury Festival last year, an inflatable raft holding dummies of migrants in life jackets was unveiled during a band’s headline set. Banksy appeared to claim the stunt, which was thought to symbolize small boat crossings of migrants in the English Channel, in a post on Instagram.The artist has also taken his message on migration to Europe.READ MORE: Paralympian refused Uber three times on one night calls for change In 2019, “The Migrant Child,” depicting a shipwrecked child holding a pink smoke bomb and wearing a life jacket, was unveiled in Venice, Italy. In 2018, a number of works including one near a former center for migrants that depicted a child spray-painting wallpaper over a swastika were discovered in Paris.Banksy has also created numerous artworks in the West Bank and Gaza Strip over the years, including one depicting a girl conducting a body search on an Israeli soldier, another showing a dove wearing a flak jacket, and a masked protester hurling a bouquet of flowers. He designed the “Walled Off Hotel” guesthouse in Bethlehem, which closed in October 2023.Last summer, Banksy captured London’s attention with an animal-themed collection, which concluded with a mural of a gorilla appearing to hold up the entrance gate to London Zoo.For nine days straight, Banksy-created creatures-- from a mountain goat perched on a building buttress to piranhas circling a police guard post to a rhinoceros mounting a car — showed up in unlikely locations around the city.",

He filed a US$10 billion ($15.1 billion) lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for a report on the alleged letter.The letter was included as part of a 2003 album compiled for alleged sex trafficker Epstein&#x27;s birthday. The president has denied having anything to do with it. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee received a copy of the birthday album on Monday as part of a batch of documents from Epstein&#x27;s estate.READ MORE: Appeals court upholds $126 million defamation judgment against President TrumpThe White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.After the letter was released, White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich posted pictures on X of Trump&#x27;s signature and tagged The Wall Street Journal&#x27;s parent corporation, News Corp, writing: \"Time for @newscorp to open that checkbook, it&#x27;s not his signature. DEFAMATION!\"Trump has denied writing the letter and creating the drawing, calling a report on it \"false, malicious, and defamatory.\"\"These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don&#x27;t draw pictures,\" Trump said.The letter released by the committee looks exactly as described by the The Wall Street Journal in its report.The letter bearing Trump&#x27;s name and signature includes text framed by a hand-drawn outline of what appears to be a curvaceous woman.READ MORE: Notorious mushroom killer Erin Patterson could walk free in her 80s \"A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret,\" the letter says.The letter&#x27;s disclosure comes amid a bipartisan push in Congress for the release of the so-called Epstein files amid years of speculation and conspiracy theories. Calls for the release of the records came from Republicans, including Vice President JD Vance before he was sworn into the country&#x27;s second-highest office.Epstein, a wealthy and well-connected financier, killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019 on charges that said he sexually abused and trafficked dozens of underage girls.The case was brought more than a decade after he secretly cut a deal with federal prosecutors in Florida to dispose of nearly identical allegations.Epstein was accused of paying underage girls hundreds of dollars in cash for massages and then molesting them.Trump&#x27;s ties to Epstein have been well-documented, though he said they had a falling-out two decades ago. He has said he kicked the financier out of his private club in Florida after Epstein betrayed him more than once by hiring people who had worked for him.The president has not been accused of misconduct in connection with their social relationship.The Justice Department in August began turning over records from the Epstein sex trafficking investigation to the House Oversight Committee.The committee subpoenaed the Epstein estate for documents last month. In addition to the birthday book, lawmakers requested Epstein&#x27;s last will and testament, agreements he signed with prosecutors, his contact books, and his financial transactions and holdings.Support is available from the National Sexual Assault, Domestic and Family Violence Counselling Service at 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732).Readers seeking support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or beyond blue on 1300 22 4636.",
