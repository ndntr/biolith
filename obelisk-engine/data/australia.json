          "content": "Australia has recorded its highest number of Indigenous deaths in custody in 46 years - a figure which has been labelled a \"national disgrace\".The Australian Institute of Criminology&#x27;s new report found Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders made up 33 out of 113 deaths in prison or police custody in 2024-25.It is the largest number since records began in 1979-80 and almost double the average since 1989–90.READ MORE: US plans social media check on Australians and other visitorsAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up only 3.8 per cent of the population, but account for more than 36 per cent of the prison population.Of the 33 people, 26 were in prison custody, while six were in police custody, and one was a child.New South Wales had the highest rates of Indigenous deaths in custody across Australia with 12, followed by Western Australia with seven.Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and the ACT each had three Indigenous deaths in custody, while the Northern Territory had one.\" The government takes this issue seriously, and we are working hard to reduce all preventable deaths in custody,\" a NSW government spokesperson said.The NSW government said the increase in Indigenous people in custody was largely being driven by rising remand rates as a result of reforms targeting violent offending, including domestic violence.Indigenous organisations and advocates blamed the increase on the wave of tough crime laws sweeping the country, which had resulted in the minimum age of criminal responsibility being lowered and tougher penalties for youth offenders.National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services acting chair Nerita Waight said Indigenous people were paying for those policies with their lives, and the only way to end deaths in custody was to stop mass incarceration.\"Every single one of these people has a name, a story, people who loved them,\" she said.\"These politicians know their policies are not only costing lives – they&#x27;re making people less safe.READ MORE: Underwater &#x27;storms&#x27; are eating away at Antarctica&#x27;s Doomsday Glacier\"When someone spends even a small time behind bars, it increases their chance of becoming trapped in an ongoing cycle of crime, imprisonment and trauma, which only harms our communities.\"Independent Victorian Senator Lidia Thorpe called the tough crime laws racist and said the record figures were a \"national disgrace\".\"This is not about safety. It is about punishment, control, politics and power,\" she said.\"Every piece of evidence shows it would be cheaper, safer, and more effective to invest in housing, bail services, income support, disability services and community-led services, not cages.\"We&#x27;ve known what works for decades. What&#x27;s missing is the courage from Canberra to follow the evidence, stop this violence and protect our people.\"The damning statistics come 34 years after the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody handed down its report, finding Indigenous people were more likely to die in custody as they were overrepresented in the justice system.The report made 339 recommendations, but some have yet to be fully implemented, which Waight said was \"completely unacceptable\".There have been 617 Indigenous deaths in custody since the Royal Commission.
