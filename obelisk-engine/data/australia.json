Video showed flames on the plane&#x27;s left wing and a trail of smoke.The crash had a ripple effect, striking and causing smaller explosions at Kentucky Petroleum Recycling and hitting Grade A Auto Parts, though it could have been worse, Beshear said.\"Thankfully, a local restaurant that is right there ... was missed and now is helping the search and rescue,\" Beshear said.\"Another blessing is this plane could have potentially hit the major Ford factory or the convention centre, those are all close by, and did not.\"University of Louisville Hospital said two people were in critical condition in the burn unit Wednesday and that 13 others had been treated and discharged. Five people were treated at other hospitals.Beshear declared a state of emergency and mobilised the National Guard in an effort to quickly free up resources.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
