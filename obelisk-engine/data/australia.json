Trump has previously been dismissive about the idea of Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize coveted by the US president in 2025, leading Venezuela in the wake of US forces kidnapping Maduro to stand trial in New York.Prior to their meeting, he said she did not have the respect or support inside the country to do so, despite the broad international assessment of her electoral success.Since Machado left the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt, while hailing her as \"a remarkable and brave voice\" , said Trump&#x27;s opinion had not changed.READ MORE: Execution of Iranian protester Erfan Soltani postponed, family says It was, Leavitt said, \"a realistic assessment\".Trump has also signalled a willingness to engage with interim president Delcy Rodriguez, a Maduro loyalist and his former vice president.The pair have talked on the phone, with Trump characterising it as a \"great conversation\" on a wide range of topics.Rodriguez, for her part, has varied her tone on the US and Trump.Originally condemning the kidnapping of Maduro and demanding his return, she has since said she is open to diplomacy with the US and may even be willing to open up Venezuela&#x27;s nationalised oil industry to foreign investment. The US, meanwhile, has continued targeting Venezuelan oil tankers, seizing a sixth one this morning.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
