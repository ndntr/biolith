          "content": "The Liberal Party has officially abandoned its target of net zero emissions by 2050 after the policy caused a staggering rift among MPs. Opposition Leader Sussan Ley confirmed her party will no longer support hitting net zero by 2050 following a five-hour party room meeting in Canberra yesterday and a smaller meeting of shadow ministers this morning.\"The Liberal Party will remove a net zero target from our policy,\" Ley told reporters in Canberra today.READ MORE: &#x27;Madness&#x27; : Mining boss issues blistering message after closureREAD MORE: What emails show about Trump-Epstein link\"And if elected, we will remove the 43 per cent by 2030 target and its net zero by 2050 target from the Climate Change Act.\"The target will no longer form part of the Liberals&#x27; wider climate policy, however, in a silver lining for the party&#x27;s moderates, MPs have agreed to stay in the 2015 Paris Agreement.\"We remain committed to the Paris Agreement and to doing our fair share to reduce emissions,\" Ley added.\"But we will do it in a way that protects households and budgets and keeps our economy strong.\"Ley used the announcement to spruik the party&#x27;s new \"energy and emissions\" policy.She said this policy, in lieu of a target pledge, will help drive down surging power bills in Australia while also tackling rising emissions.\"Australians deserve affordable energy and responsible emissions reduction,\" Ley said.\"And the Liberal Party believes we can do both. But affordable energy must come first. \"Ley claimed the Labor Party will fail in its pursuit of reducing emissions and energy prices at the same time.Shadow Minister for Energy Dan Tehan said discussions needed to continue with the Nationals over the key climate policy change.\"I cannot think of a more thorough and respectful policy process than what we have undertaken over the last six months,\" Tehan said.Tehan said the LNP would do its \"fair share\" when it comes to emissions reduction .\"We will also make sure that we reduce emissions in line with comparable countries so that we will be able to look at what like-minded countries are doing,\" he added.The Wannon MP said the Liberal Party will likely move towards a \"more technology agnostic policy\" when it comes to energy.\"That might include, you know, a nuclear power policy in years to come,\" he said, as an aside.\"But these are the kind of details that really need to be settled.\"Promise to remain in Paris Agreement Ley confirmed the Liberal Party would be sticking with the Paris Agreement and will submit the five-yearly emissions reduction targets required under the climate agreement. However, the opposition leader couldn&#x27;t answer why ditching net zero by 2050 was not in breach of the agreement.\" We remain committed to Paris and we made it very clear and it isn&#x27;t our policy to set long-term targets, but net zero would be a welcome outcome,\" Ley said.Yesterday, more than half of members advocated for ditching the 2050 target.Several conservative members of the party have driven the charge to ditch net zero, including Angus Taylor, the energy minister when net zero was initially legislated.The net zero 2050 target was introduced by former Liberal prime minister Scott Morrison in 2021, but has been the cause of bitter division among party ranks more recently.The Liberal Party&#x27;s decision follows that of its junior Coalition partner, the Nationals, which pledged to ditch the net-zero target last month.READ MORE: Warning as highly infectious disease detected at concert, tourist attractionsNationals leader David Littleproud said that he welcomes the decision to scrap net zero by 2050.\"The Nationals embarked on a calm, considered pathway back in June to get to a position to understand and review our previous position on net zero by 2050,\" Littleproud said.\"What we wanted to understand is can we live up to continuing to reducing emissions, to continue on that pathway, to do our fair share, to make sure that we do the right thing by future generations, but by doing the right thing by households and businesses today.\"Bipartisan dismay over decisionThe Coalition&#x27;s policy reversal has been slammed by the government and independent MPs.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese earlier called the Liberal Party&#x27;s debate over net zero a \"clown show\".\"It was a sign for the Australian people of how divided they are,\" he said.\"The clown show they&#x27;ve become.\"Independent MP for Warringa Zali Steggall said the decision is \"reckless\" and a \"massive step backwards\".\"Today&#x27;s announcement shows the federal Liberals, just like the Nationals, are now even further removed from community expectations over climate action in Australia,\" Stegall said.\"This decision makes the Coalition unelectable.\"An overwhelming majority of Australian voters want real leadership on climate change – not denial and delay.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "The bombshell trove of documents from the estate of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein have lit a political bonfire in the US, with one email recording the sex offender telling somebody, \"I know how dirty Donald is\".The \"Donald\" he spoke of was at that time in 2018, as he is now, the US president and Commander-in-Chief, Donald J Trump.Here&#x27;s what has been gleaned from the files so far.READ MORE: Crisis engulfs White House as Trump pressures allies&#x27;I know how dirty Donald is&#x27;The newly released documents don&#x27;t provide any smoking guns when it comes to evidence of wrongdoing by Trump. But there are suggestions throughout that Epstein knew things about Trump that could hurt him.In one 2018 email, Epstein remarked amid a discussion about Trump&#x27;s possible impeachment: \"you see , i know how dirty Donald is. my guess is that non lawyers ny biz people have no idea. What it means to have your fixer flip.\" (That last part was apparently a reference to Michael Cohen, who flipped on Trump.)After Trump won the New Hampshire primary in 2016, a correspondent wondered to Epstein about \"the stories you could tell,\" according to one of the released email exchanges.READ MORE: Former prince&#x27;s name changes again after royal decree found After the correspondent wagered that such information might not actually damage Trump, Epstein seemed to reference how Trump was \"a phony rich person.\"Epstein told the same person months earlier that he could produce photos \"of donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen.\"He also told the person that he at one point \"gave\" his 20-year-old girlfriend to Trump, in the mid-1990s.At other points in Epstein&#x27;s correspondence, author Michael Wolff seems to try and convince Epstein to come forward and say something about Trump.\"There&#x27;s an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner your great sympathy and help finish him,\" Wolff told Epstein days before the 2016 election. \"Interested?\"Trump has never been accused of wrongdoing in the Epstein case and has denied involvement in Epstein&#x27;s crimes. The White House this morning said the emails \"prove absolutely nothing, other than the fact that President Trump did nothing wrong.\"READ MORE: Trump urges Netanyahu pardon, sparking concerns over US influence Emails reignite questions about what Trump knew and whenThere have remained huge unanswered questions about what Trump knew and when about Epstein&#x27;s proclivities. That&#x27;s especially given Trump&#x27;s explanations have often proved evasive or false.The White House responded to the initial three emails mentioning Trump by arguing Democrats had \"selectively leaked\" the emails to \"create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.\"But these emails certainly deepen the intrigue about what Trump knew.To recap what we already knew: Trump in 2002 referred to how Epstein liked women \"on the younger side.\" A Florida businessman said in a 2019 interview that he raised concerns with Trump about Epstein \"going after younger girls\" at a 1992 \"calendar girl\" event.Trump adviser Roger Stone in a 2016 book quoted Trump talking about how Epstein&#x27;s \"swimming pool was full of beautiful young girls\" and joking that it was nice of Epstein to \"let the neighborhood kids use his pool.\"The president and his aides have also repeatedly said Trump distanced himself from Epstein because Epstein was a \"creep\" – but without elaborating on why, precisely, Trump viewed him as such.Beyond that, Trump this summer acknowledged being aware of Epstein&#x27;s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell recruiting employees, including the former Prince Andrew&#x27;s accuser Virginia Giuffre, at Mar-a-Lago – but he seemed to be quite reluctant to go into detail.The question from there was whether Trump had an inkling about what Giuffre was being recruited for.Trump said he didn&#x27;t \"know really why\" Epstein Maxwell was recruiting people. (Maxwell has denied recruiting people.) But Giuffre was a minor. To the extent Trump was aware of the particulars of the situation – and was aware of Epstein&#x27;s taste for young females – that would seem to raise red flags.\"It makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell&#x27;s criminal actions,\" Giuffre&#x27;s two brothers and her sisters-in-law said in a statement this summer.The 2019 Epstein email released by the committee says of Trump: \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.\"That doesn&#x27;t prove Trump knew what Maxwell and Epstein were recruiting the girls for. But it suggests that Trump was involved in telling Maxwell to knock it off and was seemingly familiar with the details of the situation.The 2011 Epstein email that suggests Giuffre \"spent hours\" at his house with Trump also adds to the relevant facts here.When Trump was acknowledging his awareness of Maxwell&#x27;s recruiting at Mar-a-Lago, he initially said he didn&#x27;t know if it was Giuffre who had been recruited. But then he quickly said that it was indeed her.If Trump actually spent time with Giuffre, as Epstein&#x27;s email seems to say, it would not only raise questions about why. It would also make Trump&#x27;s handling of the situation appear even more bizarre.And it&#x27;s clear from Giuffre&#x27;s own memoir that they knew each other and had had conversations about her working for his friends.\"Trump couldn&#x27;t have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic that I was there,\" Giuffre writes about the time that her father took her to meet Trump in his office. She goes on to recount that Trump asked her if she liked children and explained that he had friends in houses \"next to the resort\" who needed babysitting for their kids.Giuffre did not accuse Trump of any wrongdoing in her recent posthumously-published memoir. The emails undercut Maxwell&#x27;s attempts to distance Trump from EpsteinThe Trump Justice Department decided to interview Maxwell, a convicted sex offender, this summer while her appeals were ongoing. It did so despite her established credibility problems and motivations to say what the administration wanted.(Trump at the time hadn&#x27;t ruled out the possibility of pardoning Maxwell. And around this time, we also learned Maxwell had been moved to a lower-security prison camp for which she didn&#x27;t appear eligible as a sex offender. The administration still hasn&#x27;t explained how this happened, months later.)And sure enough, Maxwell said things that were helpful to the president. She basically said she had no knowledge of any Trump wrongdoing and downplayed his relationship with Epstein.But the new emails call her claims into question.Speaking of Trump&#x27;s and Epstein&#x27;s relationship, Maxwell said in her testimony, the transcript of which was released in August: \"I don&#x27;t think they were close friends, or I certainly never witnessed the president in any of – I don&#x27;t recall ever seeing him in his house, for instance.\"But the newly released emails suggest Maxwell was aware of Trump being at Epstein&#x27;s house, at least as of 2011.After Epstein in the email referenced someone spending \"hours at my house\" with Trump, Maxwell responds, \"I have been thinking about that.\"Maxwell&#x27;s attorney didn&#x27;t immediately respond to a request for comment.This is not the first Maxwell claim from that interview that has been called into question.Epstein and Maxwell seemed to think this information about Trump was significantWe surely need to learn more about the context of these emails. But one of the biggest takeaways is that they suggest Epstein and Maxwell seemed to feel this information about Trump was significant. There&#x27;s even a hint they suggested that information could be used as leverage.The timelines are important here.The 2011 email came as news was blowing up about Epstein&#x27;s ties to Prince Andrew, as he was then known. (He was recently stripped of his noble title.) As CNN has reported, around this time Epstein seemed to be going into legal attack mode.Prince Andrew&#x27;s most prominent accuser was Giuffre.It was in this context that Epstein and Maxwell conversed about Trump having spent time at Epstein&#x27;s house with someone who, according to Republicans, is identified in the email as Giuffre.And notably, Epstein described Trump as the \"dog that hasn&#x27;t barked.\" This is an expression that comes from Sherlock Holmes mysteries; it basically means the absence of an expected event.Which leads to the obvious question: Why might Epstein and Maxwell have expected news about Trump to have come out?The timeline of the 2019 email is also relevant. That&#x27;s because it came during Trump&#x27;s first term as his administration was weighing significant action vis-à-vis Epstein.The Miami Herald had in late 2018 run a major exposé on the sweetheart deal Epstein received from US Attorney Alexander Acosta, who later became Trump&#x27;s labor secretary. By early 2019, a major question was whether the Justice Department would probe that deal.The DOJ&#x27;s inspector general said on January 30 of that year that he didn&#x27;t have the power to examine the situation. But by February 6 the DOJ&#x27;s Office of Professional Responsibility signaled that it had opened an investigation.CNN reported at the time that multiple authorities were reviewing allegations about Epstein and minors as of early that year.It was in this context, on January 31, that Epstein emailed Wolff about Trump \"of course\" being aware of Maxwell&#x27;s recruitment at Mar-a-Lago.The newly released emails also include a 2015 Epstein exchange with Wolff in which the two of them strategise about how then-candidate Trump should handle questions about his ties to Epstein. Wolff said he had heard CNN was going to ask Trump about it at the debate, either on air or after. (There is no mention of Epstein in the transcript of the debate.)In that email, Wolff suggests the best course would be to \"let him hang himself\" by denying being on Epstein&#x27;s plane or his house.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "Australia&#x27;s pesticide regulator has flagged fresh health concerns for young children over a chemical sprayed on berries.With their high nutritional content, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries have become a favourite for families as part of healthier diets.But the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) says existing regulations over using dimethoate - an insecticide widely used to stop berries being spoiled by fruit fly - need strengthening to keep people safe.READ MORE: Storms to hammer Australia from top of NT to bottom of SAIn a decision announced this week, the national watchdog said children aged between two and six years old who ate berries treated with dimethoate within seven days or less of harvest risked exposure of the chemical beyond safe limits.The APVMA ruled fruit growers must now wait at least 14 days after applying the pesticide before harvesting to give it more time to degrade.It said existing label directions needed altering to ensure dimethoate&#x27;s use on berries did not present \"an undue hazard to people\".Until now, growers had to wait one day after spraying blueberries and seven days following the treatment of raspberries and blackberries. Earlier this year, the APVMA began reviewing potential health hazards from dimethoate amid the growing popularity of berries.Data from Food Standards Australia and New Zealand showed Australians&#x27; consumption of blueberries, blackberries and raspberries has jumped since the last review of the pesticide in 2017.Health concerns over dimethoate resulted in European Union countries banning the chemical in 2019.Industry body Berries Australia told 9news.com.au that figures it collected over the past five years showed dimethoate usage had fallen.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
