          "content": "Novels by award-winning author Craig Silvey have been pulled from shelves, as the public responds to child exploitation charges brought against him.The 43-year-old author, who penned popular novels including Jasper Jones, Runt and Honeybee, was arrested on Monday following a raid of his Fremantle home.Silvey has been charged with possessing and distributing child exploitation material and is accused of conversing online about his sexual interest in children. READ MORE: Alleged underworld kingpin arrested in IraqProsecutors told the court Silvey had not allowed detectives to access his devices, and had so far refused to provide pin codes.Silvey&#x27;s publisher Allen & Unwin today confirmed it would \"pause promotional activity\" of the author&#x27;s work while the legal process takes its course.\"We acknowledge this is an active police matter, and that Mr Silvey is entitled to procedural fairness and a presumption of innocence until the matter is dealt with by a court,\" a spokesperson said.\"The nature of the allegations is deeply distressing. Our thoughts and sympathies are with all survivors of child exploitation and their families.\"Local publisher Fremantle Press confirmed it too would stop promoting Silvey&#x27;s book Rhubarb while the court process takes place. \"The alleged offences are shocking and abhorrent, and we acknowledge survivors of child exploitation and their families,\" the publisher said.\"We acknowledge the presumption of innocence and the importance of procedural fairness, and will make no further comment until legal proceedings are complete.\"Dymocks and other major Australian book retailers have also pulled Silvey&#x27;s work from the shop floor.READ MORE: Donald Trump flips off, appears to swear at hecklerAustralian online bookseller Booktopia told 9News it was \"working closely with the publisher regarding their plans and will continue to assess the situation\".Silvey&#x27;s books Jasper Jones and Rhubarb will also be axed as suggested English and Literature texts for Year 11s and 12s in WA next year.WA&#x27;s Education Minister Sabine Winton said the nature of the allegations against Silvey was \"deeply concerning\".\"I have asked the Department of Education to ensure that schools cease using texts by Craig Silvey for the 2026 school year while the allegations are under investigation,\" Winton said.\"Some students may have studied these texts in previous years. The School Curriculum and Standards Authority will not penalise Year 12 students who may refer to these texts in the 2026 ATAR Literature course examination.Premier Roger Cook backed his frontbencher&#x27;s decision to suspend the texts from schools despite the fact allegations brought against Silvey are yet to be proven in court.\"Through an abundance of caution, the minister has done the right thing, which is to suspend those texts,\" Cook said.\"In the context of the 2026 education year I support that decision. I think it&#x27;s an appropriate one.\"Teaching resources relating to Silvey&#x27;s book Runt have been withdrawn from circulation in Victoria, the department of education confirmed.\"Craig Silvey&#x27;s texts have been removed from the Victorian Lesson Plans, are not on any VCE English, VCE English as an Additional Language or VCE Literature lists, and his books will not feature in the 2026 Premier&#x27;s Reading Challenge,\" a Victorian Department of Education spokesperson said.Fans of Silvey&#x27;s writing have reacted strongly following news of the allegations, taking to social media with videos of them disposing of his books after he faced court yesterday.Silvey was granted bail yesterday under strict conditions.He has yet to plead to the charges.National Sexual Assault, Domestic Family Violence Counselling Service 1800RESPECT (1800 737 732).DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

He said he ordered an investigation.The accident occurred about 9am local time (1pm AEDT) when a crane being used in the construction of a high-speed rail bridge fell.Some of the passengers were school students, according to authorities.Photos published in Thai media showed plumes of white then dark smoke above the scene, and construction equipment hanging down from between two concrete support pillars.Rescue workers stood on top of overturned carriages, some of them with gaping holes torn in their sides, video from public broadcaster ThaiPBS showed.What appeared to be sections of the crane were scattered along the track. Meanwhile, paramedics gave first aid to injured passengers.Thai media reported the train had three carriages, the last two being the most damaged.The derailment occurred on part of an ambitious planned high-speed rail project that will eventually connect China with much of South-East Asia.The elevated segment that collapsed is a part of a Thai-Chinese high-speed railway project linking the national capital Bangkok to the north-eastern province of Nong Khai, bordering Laos.The two-stage rail project has a total investment cost of more than 520 billion baht ($24.7 billion) and is associated with an ambitious plan to connect China with South-East Asia under Beijing&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative.A map of the proposed route shows the railway would connect Bangkok with the Laos capital of Vientiane and Kunming, the capital of China&#x27;s Yunnan province.A joint commitment between the Thai and Chinese governments, the railway would use \"Chinese construction technologies and railway systems\" but would be financed and built by Thailand.In August 2024, a railway tunnel on the planned route, also in Nakhon Ratchasima, collapsed, killing three workers. Days of heavy rainfall were believed to have been a factor in the collapse.- With AP",
