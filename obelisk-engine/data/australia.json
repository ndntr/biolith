          "content": "F ormer state premiers Daniel Andrews and Bob Carr will join authoritarian leaders Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin as guests at a huge Chinese military parade today.Andrews, an ex Victorian premier, and Carr, a former NSW premier and foreign minister, will be among the 10,000 strong crowd watching the event in Beijing&#x27;s Tiananmen Square to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.The former politicians - who have a record of forging links with China - are attending in a personal capacity. READ MORE: Neo-Nazi charged hours after crashing media conferenceThe parade will showcase China&#x27;s newest warfighting kit, including hypersonic missiles, tanks, stealth fighters in a display of the communist ruled nation&#x27;s military arsenal.Analyst Neil Thomas, from the Asia Society Policy Institute think tank, told Today the parade had drawn a \"rogues&#x27; gallery\" of authoritarian world leaders, including North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin.He said the attendance of Carr and Daniels would likely bolster the Chinese government&#x27;s efforts to promote the event, and its claims China was the major force behind Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II.\"They&#x27;re (Carr and Daniels) not representing Australia, although, of course, they did hold senior roles in state governments before.\"So it&#x27;s certainly the case that China is looking to use their participation to bolster the international reach and legitimacy of this parade.\"READ MORE: Two sought as CCTV released over daylight Sydney shootingIn addition to the North Korean and Russian dictators, the leaders of hardline regimes such as Iran and Belarus will also be watching the parade.\"The fact that the company you have at this parade is a rogues gallery of international leaders like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-Un, it certainly doesn&#x27;t leave a good taste in your mouth.,\" Thomas said.The federal government confirmed senior Australian officials will not be attending. The country&#x27;s ambassador, Scott Dewar, has chosen instead to host the Australian business community in the southern city of Guangzhou. Carr has a track record of promoting closer relations between Australia and China.In an opinion piece for The Sydney Morning Herald earlier this week, he said the efforts of China during World War II had helped save Australia from Japanese aggression.During his stint as premier of Victoria, Andrews made the state a part of China&#x27;s Belt and Road infrastructure project. It prompted the federal government to step in and quash the deal over foreign interference concerns.

The younger men were both charged with violent order and affray, with the 23-year-old also faces an assault by kicking charge and the 20-year-old is accused of discharging a missile.They were granted bail to face court on December 10. 9News understands the charges are in relation to an alleged incident on Sunday where white supremacists stormed a First Nations camp.Footage of the alleged incident showed a group neo-Nazis charging towards Camp Sovereignty, a sacred site and standing protest in Kings Domain.Members of the group allegedly attacked the Indigenous group with sticks and flag poles.Witnesses also reported seeing the Indigenous flag being burned, which Deputy Premier Ben Carroll called \"appalling\".Sewell&#x27;s arrest came hours after he gatecrashed Allan&#x27;s press conference, where he yelled at the premier over his right to protest.Allan was with Treasurer Jaclyn Symes in North Melbourne when Sewell arrived.\"Why don&#x27;t Australians have the right to protest?\" Sewell could be heard saying.READ MORE: &#x27;Gutless&#x27; attack by neo-Nazis on sacred Indigenous site slammed\"Why do you want to ban us from protesting? Shouldn&#x27;t we have the right to speak in our own country?\" Sewell was held back by security as Allan and Symes quickly left.Sewell was heard telling security, \"You don&#x27;t have the right to put your hands on me\".READ MORE: Fears the country&#x27;s most wanted man is &#x27;getting help&#x27;\"We&#x27;re going to take this country back from politicians like you,\" he said to Allan.Sewell left the scene after Allan, walking away on foot.\"Victoria Police is aware of an incident at a media stand-up in North Melbourne this morning where a man attended and was verbally abusive towards the premier,\" a police spokesperson said.\"The premier&#x27;s security team intervened to ensure the safety of everyone present and the man left shortly after.\"Allan also issued a statement, saying she was \"unharmed and undeterred\".She said it was a \"badge of honour\" to earn the ire of Nazis.\"But this isn&#x27;t about me. It&#x27;s about all the other people in the community who Nazis target - like multicultural people, LGBTIQA+ people, First Peoples, and Jews,\" she said in the written statement.\"They&#x27;re the Victorians who are on my mind right now, and they&#x27;re the Victorians who our anti-hate laws will protect when they come into force later this month.\"The new legislation will strengthen Victoria&#x27;s existing vilification laws, and make it a criminal offence to incite hate or threaten harm based on a protected attribute.\"We know how these goons operate. They whip up fear to divide our society. They will fail,\" Allan said of Sewell.\"Because Victorians are fair, and our values are strong.\"The New Zealand-born white nationalist figure recently made a speech to the crowd at the anti-immigration March For Australia rally in Melbourne on Sunday.In his tirade at the press conference, Sewell also incorrectly claimed 50,000 people attended that rally.On Sunday, he was also seen in a crowd that allegedly attacked an Indigenous encampment, Camp Sovereignty, after splitting off from the main rally.Police are investigating the incident, which Police Minister Andrew Carbines labelled \"gutless\".DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
