          "content": "Japan&#x27;s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has announced he will resign following growing calls from within his party to take responsibility for a historic defeat in July&#x27;s parliamentary election.Ishiba, who took office in October, on Sunday said he was stepping down as prime minister and as the head of his conservative Liberal Democratic Party.Ishiba, a 68-year-old moderate centrist, had resisted demands from opponents further to the right within his own party to resign. He argued that he wanted to avoid a political vacuum at a time when Japan faces key domestic and international challenges, including US tariffs, rising prices and growing tensions in the Asia-Pacific.READ MORE: Mistaken identity? Two kids killed in machete tragedyIshiba explained at a news conference Sunday night as he announced his resignation plans that he had intended for some time to take responsibility for his party&#x27;s summer election loss, but was first determined to make progress in tariff negotiations with the United States. He described it as matter of the national interest.\"Who would seriously negotiate with a government whose leader says he is stepping down?\" Ishiba said.He said the moment had arrived with an order by US President Donald Trump on Friday to lower tariffs on Japanese cars and other products to 15 per cent from a previously imposed 25 per cent rate.\"Having reached a milestone in the U.S. tariff negotiations, I decided now is the time to make way for a successor,\" Ishiba said.Pressure from the partyThe resignation came one day before his party was to decide whether to hold an early leadership election, which would have amounted to a virtual no-confidence motion against him if approved.He said he made the \"painful decision to resign\" to avert that step because \"it would cause a critical division within the party, and that is absolutely not my intention\".Ishiba said he would instead start a process to hold a party leadership vote to choose his replacement, which is expected to be held in October. He is to remain as prime minister until a new party leader is elected and endorsed by the parliament.He said he is not going to run, even though he regrets leaving behind unfinished business, such as measures for salary increases, agricultural reforms and further strengthening Japan&#x27;s security.READ MORE: Former surf pro pays tribute after shark tragedyLoss after lossIn July, Ishiba&#x27;s ruling coalition failed to secure a majority in the 248-seat upper house in a crucial parliamentary election, weakening the stability of his government. The loss followed a defeat in the more powerful lower house, where the party-led coalition lost its majority in October, only two weeks after Ishiba took over.Party lawmakers who support the prime minister said those who lost seats were largely ultra-conservatives who were linked to corruption scandals before Ishiba took office. Public polling showed that pressure on Ishiba to resign caused his support to grow.Calls for Ishiba to step down grew after the Liberal Democratic Party last week called for a \"complete overhaul\" of the party following its losses.A conservative heavyweight Taro Aso, known for his anti-Ishiba stance, and a minister and several deputy ministers in the Ishiba Cabinet requested an early vote, prompting others to follow suit.READ MORE: Police arrest hundreds at London protestFormer Health Minister Norihisa Tamura said on a talk show of the public broadcaster NHK earlier Sunday that the best way to heal party divisions and move forward is for Ishiba \"to settle\" the dispute before Monday&#x27;s vote. The party has already been distracted from necessary work on economic measures and on figuring out ways to gain opposition support in the next parliamentary session, Tamura said.Possible candidates to replace Ishiba include Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, as well as ultra-conservative former Economic Security Minister Sanae Takaichi, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, a moderate and the protege of former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.Lacking a majority in both houses, the next party leader will have to work with the main opposition parties to get bills passed, experts say, or else face constant risks of no-confidence motions.The opposition parties, however, are too splintered to form a big coalition to topple the government.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

Sydneysiders are urged to avoid beaches in the area as lifeguards keep people from entering the water.Drone operators will be scanning the water for any signs of shark activity.\"Volunteers will continue to assist council and authorities to protect the public from further danger in any way we can,\" Pearce said.\"For now, please remain clear of the water at beaches in the vicinity and follow the direction of lifeguards and lifesavers.\"Authorities offered their condolences to the victim&#x27;s family and the wider community. \"There has been a tragic loss of life on one of our beaches, and our deepest condolences today are with the man&#x27;s family and friends,\" Northern Beaches Council said.\"Our deepest condolences go to the family of the man involved in this terrible tragedy,\" Surf Life Saving NSW chief executive Steve Pearce said.\"The NSW government&#x27;s thoughts are with the bite victim, their family and the first responders,\" a spokesperson for the Department of Primary Industries said.READ MORE: Fire destroys heritage wedding venue in Sydney&#x27;s north-westShark attacks in Sydney are incredibly rare, with only one recorded fatality in the past 60 years.Diving instructor Simon Nellist was killed while swimming off Little Bay Beach in the city&#x27;s south in 2022.The shark was confirmed later to be a great white.Before that, the last fatal shark attack in Sydney was in 1963, when well-known actress Marcia Hathaway was fatally mauled by a bull shark while standing in 30cm of water in Middle Harbour.READ MORE: Sharyce looks perfectly healthy but hasn&#x27;t been able to work in yearsShark nets came up for the season across 51 beaches between Newcastle and Wollongong on Monday.
