You are responsible for the death of a good man, and I accept that you understand that.\"Kemp, a psychology and criminology graduate, had spent part of her voyage volunteering before travelling to Perth.Her sentence was backdated to June 1 to reflect the time she has been in custody.The incident thrust e-scooters into the spotlight and triggered a WA parliamentary inquiry into their safety.",

          "content": "Former political staffer Brittany Higgins has been bankrupted by her former boss, bringing the former politician one step closer to discovering where the former staffer&#x27;s $2.4 million compensation payout went.Ex-Liberal senator Linda Reynolds launched bankruptcy proceedings in October against Higgins after she successfully sued her for defamation.Federal Court judge Michael Feutrill today made orders to sequestrate Higgins&#x27; estate under the Bankruptcy Act after a series of minor setbacks and technical difficulties that slowed the process.READ MORE: Woman&#x27;s life ruined by massage she booked after hearing Jackie O raveThe date of the act of bankruptcy was backdated to October 8.\"(The estate will) be handed over to the trustee of the bankruptcy who will take control of her affairs and deal with the creditors in due course,\" Reynolds&#x27; lawyer Rachel Ross told reporters outside the court in Perth.Reynolds&#x27; high-profile defamation victory over Higgins concerned a series of social media posts the former defence minister believed damaged her reputation.Reynolds was awarded damages of $315,000 plus $26,109 interest after Western Australia&#x27;s Supreme Court in August found some of the posts were defamatory.Higgins was also ordered to pay 80 per cent of her former boss&#x27; legal costs, which are estimated to be more than $1 million.Reynolds&#x27; lawyer, Martin Bennett, previously said the bankruptcy would allow Reynolds to find out how much of Higgins&#x27; commonwealth settlement remained as she attempted to recoup her legal costs for the defamation case.READ MORE: Actress Amanda Seyfried doubles down on Charlie Kirk commentsHiggins apologised to Reynolds after the former defence minister emerged victorious from the duo&#x27;s high-profile five-week defamation trial.Justice Paul Tottle found Higgins&#x27; social media posts carried an array of imputations.They included that Reynolds engaged in a campaign of harassment against Higgins, mishandled her rape allegation and engaged in questionable conduct during Bruce Lehrmann&#x27;s aborted criminal trial for rape.The 360-page judgment made factual findings about the events involving Reynolds and Higgins, including her alleged 2019 rape and the events in the years after it.Higgins made 26 false or misleading statements in media interviews after her alleged sexual assault, the judgment said.She alleges former co-worker Lehrmann raped her in the senator&#x27;s ministerial suite.READ MORE: The damning evidence against Charlie Kirk&#x27;s alleged assassinA Federal Court judge overseeing a defamation case launched by Lehrmann against Network Ten found Higgins was, on the balance of probabilities, raped by her former co-worker in the office.Lehrmann has lost an appeal against that finding but has flagged taking the case to the High Court.He denies the rape allegation, and his criminal trial was derailed by juror misconduct.Higgins&#x27; husband, David Sharaz, was also served with a bankruptcy notice by Reynolds and is expected to declare bankruptcy.He was also found to have defamed the former politician and was ordered to pay $85,000 in damages plus interest and costs.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
