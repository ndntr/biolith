          "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday that he will meet over the weekend with US President Donald Trump in Florida.Zelenskyy told journalists that the two leaders will discuss security guarantees for Ukraine during Sunday&#x27;s talks, and that the 20-point plan under discussion \"is about 90% ready\".The announced meeting is the latest development in an extensive US-led diplomatic push to end the nearly four-year Russia-Ukraine war, but efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv.READ MORE: Police chase comes to crashing end after alleged ram-raid \"A lot can be decided before the New Year,\" Zelenskyy wrote on X earlier in the day, before announcing details of the meeting.Zelenskyy&#x27;s comments came after he said on Thursday that he had a \"good conversation\" with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump&#x27;s son-in-law.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday that the Kremlin had already been in contact with US representatives since Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev met with US envoys in Florida over the weekend.\"It was agreed upon to continue the dialogue,\" he said.Trump has unleashed a diplomatic push to end Russia&#x27;s all-out war, which began on February 24, 2022, but his efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv.Zelenskyy said on Tuesday that he would be willing to withdraw troops from Ukraine&#x27;s eastern industrial heartland as part of a plan to end the war, if Russia also pulls back and the area becomes a demilitarised zone monitored by international forces.Though Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday that there had been \"slow but steady progress\" in the peace talks, Russia has given no indication that it will agree to any kind of withdrawal from land it has seized.In fact, Moscow has insisted that Ukraine relinquish the remaining territory it still holds in the Donbas — an ultimatum that Ukraine has rejected. Russia has captured most of Luhansk and about 70 per cent of Donetsk — the two areas that make up the Donbas.On the ground, one person was killed and three others were wounded when a guided aerial bomb hit a house in Ukraine&#x27;s Zaporizhzhia region, while six people were wounded in a missile strike on the city of Uman, local officials said on Friday.Russian drone attacks on the city of Mykolaiv and its suburbs overnight into Friday left part of the city without power. Energy and port infrastructure were damaged by drones in the city of Odesa on the Black Sea.Meanwhile, Ukraine said that it struck a major Russian oil refinery on Thursday using UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles.Ukraine&#x27;s General Staff said that its forces hit the Novoshakhtinsk refinery in Russia&#x27;s Rostov region.\"Multiple explosions were recorded. The target was hit,\" it wrote on Telegram.Rostov regional Gov. Yuri Slyusar said that a firefighter was wounded when extinguishing the fire.Ukraine&#x27;s long-range drone strikes on Russian refineries aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue its full-scale invasion.Russia wants to cripple the Ukraine&#x27;s power grid, seeking to deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Ukrainian officials say is an attempt to \"weaponise winter.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
