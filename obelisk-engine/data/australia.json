Hundreds of officers and specialist police have swarmed the small country town as Victoria Police commit every resource available to track down and apprehend Freeman.LIVE UPDATES: &#x27;Wear him down&#x27;: Weather a major factor in gunman searchFreeman allegedly fled the scene after gunning down two police officers, Neal Thompson, 59, and Vadim De Waart, 35, about 10.30am on Tuesday at a semi-rural property on Rayner Track. Chief Commissioner Mike Bush said yesterday that Freeman knew the area better than the police and was well-versed in bushcraft.READ MORE: Two dead in US after shooter opens fire on children celebrating MassFreeman could possibly survive in bush for &#x27;months&#x27;Criminologist Vincent Hurley says it was possible Freeman could survive out in the bush for \"months\" - but he doesn&#x27;t think it likely.\"If he&#x27;s a bit of a prepper, as they say, he could have somewhere in a cave food, water, change of clothes, jacket, firearms and ammunition, so he could be out there for months,\" Hurley told Today.Police previously described Freeman as skilled in bushcraft.However, Hurley suspected it was more likely police had the area Freeman was in cordoned off and that he would be unable to slip past them.Hurley also said the chilly, wet weather conditions around Porepunkah will help the police rather than the suspect.\"Once they find him, they may not rush in and arrest him, but they&#x27;ll assess his physical condition because he&#x27;s exposed to the elements,\" Hurley told Today.\"They&#x27;ll be able to be rotated through themselves during each shift, but he won&#x27;t be, so the conditions will wear him down.\"Storm, hail could impact search Snow is forecast to fall above 900 metres, while temperatures will range from 5 to 13 degrees.Winds are blowing north-westerly between 20km/h and 30km/h.Tomorrow conditions are set to worsen, with the snow level falling to 700m and the chance of damaging winds and of a thunderstorm in the north of the region.Hail is also possible tomorrow evening, while temperatures will range from 4 to 12 degrees.Tonight, the mercury is set to fall as low as 2 degrees.Another day of lockdown Porepunkah residents are also facing another day indoors in lockdown as the search for Freeman continues.People in Porepunkah and surrounding townships can expect to see a lot of police activity in and around their community,\" Victoria Police said in their latest update yesterday.\"The emergency alert sent out to people in the local Porepunkah area this morning, urging them to stay indoors, remains active.\"Police continue to advise people to remain vigilant and stay indoors where possible while the search for this suspect continues.\"READ MORE: Queensland woman denied boarding, forced to pay $10k over visa errorTributes to slain officers Police yesterday paid tribute to the two \"unique and irreplacable\" officers who were killed in the shooting on Tuesday.Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson, 59, and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart, 35, attended the property in Porepunkah alongside eight other officers to serve a warrant to suspect Freeman.\"Neal joined Victoria Police in September 1987 and, after completing his training, spent seven years in general duties at Collingwood Police Station,\" Victoria Police said in a statement.\"For the next decade, Neal worked as a detective at the Major Fraud Squad and the State Crime Squad, before taking up his most recent post at Wangaratta CIU in July 2007.\"Thompson has been described as an \"adventurer who loved all things outdoors\". \"Neal had spent the past six years alongside his partner, Lisa, the love of his life,\" the statement continued.Belgian-born De Waart began his police career in 2018.He worked at St Kilda Police Station for thee years and had been on a temporary assignment in Wangaratta, police said.\" An eternal optimist and avid traveller, Vadim was fluent in French, Spanish, Flemish and English.He had also completed scuba dives all around the world and motorcycling trips more locally with his friends and colleagues,\" the statement said.\"He was a keen gin collector and always picked up a local bottle on his overseas adventures for his large collection at home.\"While travelling was his passion, Vadim was extremely proud to have purchased his first home in Melbourne in recent years.\"F loral tributes continue to pour in for the two slain police officers.The flowers are piling up outside Wangaratta Police Station, but also at Kings Domain in Melbourne.M elbourne landmarks were lit up in blue overnight to honour the lives of Thompson and De Waart.Flinders Street Station was among the public buildings illuminated.
