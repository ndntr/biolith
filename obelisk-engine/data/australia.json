          "content": "A self-confessed neo-Nazi could face serious charges over a hate-filled speech at an anti-immigration demonstration in Sydney.The March for Australia anti-immigration rally yesterday was railroaded by members of the neo-Nazi group White Australia.Its leader – Jack Eltis, a father from the city&#x27;s north-west – could potentially be investigated for spewing hate speech.\"Send them back, no debate, no discussion, we want to send them back to their land,\" he said.Many in the crowd were unimpressed, booing the speakers.At the end, the Nazi overtones were unmistakable as one speaker yelled \"hail Australia\".Premier Chris Minns today called the march divisive.\"If you&#x27;re going to a rally and the Nazis turn up, it&#x27;s not one you should be at,\" he said.Minns said he&#x27;d spoken to police and they were investigating the speeches made at the rally.It&#x27;s a criminal offence in NSW to intentionally and publicly incite racial hatred. The maximum penalty is two years in jail. The speeches of several White Australia members will be scrutinised.After the rally, Eltis was clear about his ideology.\"All the men in our organisation are proud to be racist,\" he said.Asked if they were Nazis, he said \"yes, we&#x27;re national socialists\".In Melbourne, vision has surfaced of another neo-Nazi group tearing into an Indigenous camp in the hours after the March for Australia rally there.In Adelaide, police are searching for a man filmed yesterday during the protest holding a poster supporting accused cop killer Dezi Freeman.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
