          "content": "Opposition Leader Sussan Ley has been accused of going \"rogue\" after penning a letter to US Republicans vowing to reverse Australia&#x27;s recognition of Palestinian statehood.In an unprecedented move, Ley wrote to US Republicans to assure Congress members a Coalition government would revoke Palestinian recognition if elected.The letter was reportedly sent to a group of Trump allies ahead of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese&#x27;s address to the United Nations in New York City, after he formally confirmed Australia&#x27;s position on a Palestinian state.READ MORE: Trump blames autism on a drug found in everyone&#x27;s home\"I write to reassure you, and the Congress, that this decision taken at this time by the Labor government does not enjoy bipartisan support here in Australia,\" Ley wrote in an excerpt of the letter published by the Sydney Morning Herald.\"The federal opposition opposes this decision and would reverse it should we form government.\"The opposition leader said the decision \"does not reflect the view of a majority of Australians\" and references an August Resolve poll which said 44 per cent of voters believed the government should not recognise statehood.Another 32 per cent said Labor should have waited until Hamas was destabilised and a further 24 per cent supported the federal government&#x27;s announcement.Ley later said she spoke with Israel&#x27;s Foreign Minister Gideon Sa&#x27;ar to \"express my disappointment\" with Albanese&#x27;s announcement.\"I expressed my disappointment at this break with bipartisanship and reiterated the Coalition&#x27;s long-held position that recognition must only come at the end of a genuine two-state process,\" Ley said in a post on X.\"Now is the wrong time while Hamas holds hostages and while conflict still rages.\"I voiced concerns for Australia&#x27;s Jewish community, the rise of antisemitism, and the humanitarian toll of the conflict. I also expressed my hope for the safe return of hostages and a ceasefire as soon as possible.\"The Coalition will continue to stand firmly with Israel and oppose reckless decisions that reward terrorists.\"READ MORE: Backflip over Kimmel suspension is network&#x27;s &#x27;mistake to make&#x27;Liberal Senator Andrew Bragg told Today this morning that Ley wanted American politicians to \"know that this is not something that&#x27;s widely supported here in Australia\".Bragg also described Albanese&#x27;s move as a \"deeply unserious\" proposal. Communications Minister Amanda Rishworth said it was Ley simply \"shoring up\" her interests locally.She said Ley was hurting Australia&#x27;s reputation as a united front.\"I do think that she has misstepped here,\" Rishworth told Today. \"I think, quite frankly, I think this is more about her shoring up her political survival than it actually is about what&#x27;s in Australia&#x27;s interests.\"Foreign Minister Penny Wong backed Rishworth&#x27;s remarks.She told the ABC&#x27;s Radio National Breakfast that Ley was running a \"rogue foreign policy\" by contradicting Australia&#x27;s official position on Palestine.\"It is possible to back Australia and still be an effective opposition, and really, it&#x27;s time that Ms Ley and the Liberals understood that,\" Wong said. \"We know we&#x27;re strongest when we speak with one voice, we all understand that as Australians, and the opposition should understand that too.\"Albanese addressed the UN General Assembly in New York hours after Australia formally recognised a Palestinian state. \"Working together, we can build a future where instead of children in Gaza dying in pain, living in fear, or being taught to hate - they can go to school, build a &#x27;life in larger freedom&#x27;, aspire to raise children of their own,\" he said earlier today.\"That future depends on recognition being followed by reconstruction and reform.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
