It spreads when leaders stay silent. It retracts when leaders act. I call upon you to replace weakness with action, appeasement with resolve, and to do so by a clear date: the Jewish New Year, September 23, 2025,\" he wrote.\"History will not forgive hesitation. It will honour action.\" Responding to the remarks today, Albanese said: \"I treat leaders of other countries with respect and I engage with them in a diplomatic way.\"\" I don&#x27;t take these things personally,\" he told the media from Adelaide today.\"He has had similar things to say about other leaders.\"What I say is that Israel, increasingly, there is global concern because people want to see an end to the cycle of violence that we have seen for far too long. That is what Australians want to see as well.\"READ MORE: Fertility giant to keep review secret after two IVF bunglesOpposition Leader Sussan Ley yesterday said the prime minister deserved respect but described it as a \"two-way street\" and pushed Albanese to \"explain how he is going to repair this relationship, which is now in tatters as a result of his failures of leadership\".\"Anthony Albanese has mismanaged international relationships to the point where he now finds himself at the centre of a troubling diplomatic incident,\" she said in a statement.\"This is a direct consequence of bad decisions he and his government have taken that do not advance Australia&#x27;s interests.\"Albanese said he would repair Australia&#x27;s relationship with Israel by continuing to put forward Australia&#x27;s position.\"Australians want those two things.

But coming from the country&#x27;s most powerful politician, it&#x27;s a significant escalation in the deterioration of diplomatic ties between two allies.READ MORE: Australia hurtling towards hidden crisisDeath toll in Gaza rises to 62,000Gaza&#x27;s Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, said the Palestinian death toll from 22 months of war has passed 62,000.It does not say how many were civilians or combatants, but says women and children make up around half the dead. The United Nations and other independent experts view its figures as the most reliable count of casualties.Israel announced plans to reoccupy Gaza City and other heavily populated areas after ceasefire talks stalled last month, raising the possibility of a worsening humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, which experts say is sliding into famine.Netanyahu has dismissed reports of starvation in Gaza as \"lies\" promoted by Hamas.But the UN last week warned that starvation and malnutrition in the occupied Palestinian territory are at their highest levels since the war began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, in which the militants abducted 251 people and killed about 1200, mostly civilians.READ MORE: Plane forced to land in Italy after flames erupt mid-airHamas says it has accepted a new Arab proposal in Gaza ceasefire talksHamas on Tuesday said it had accepted a proposal from Arab mediators for a ceasefire. Israel has not yet responded and says it is still committed to defeating the militant group.The latest proposal developed by Egypt and Qatar contains only slight modifications to an earlier one advanced by the United States and accepted by Israel, according to Egyptian and Hamas officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive talks.The deal would include a 60-day truce, the release of some of the hostages held by Hamas in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, a flood of humanitarian aid into Gaza and talks on a lasting ceasefire.Israel has vowed to continue the war until all the hostages are returned and Hamas is disarmed.US President Donald Trump gave support to those goals on Monday in a social media post, saying Hamas must be \"confronted and destroyed\" to ensure the return of the remaining hostages.Netanyahu has said that while he will halt the fighting temporarily to facilitate the release of hostages, he will not end the war until Hamas has been defeated and disarmed.- with Associated Press DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
