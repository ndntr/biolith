The Trains shot another officer in the hip and lit a grass fire in an attempt to locate the fourth officer, who had hidden.Alan Dare, a neighbour, was shot trying to flee the fire.Additional police arrived to the scene and an hours-long standoff ensued. It ended with the deaths of Gareth, Nathaniel and Stacey Train.An inquest in November 2025 found that the Trains were \"psychotically unwell\" with a \"shared delusional disorder\", but not terrorists.READ MORE: Grief-stricken families disappointed by Wieambilla coronial findings Darwin mass shooting: June 4, 2019Benjamin Glenn Hoffmann was high on drugs when he began shooting at the Palms Motel in Darwin in the early evening of June 4, 2019.He fired multiple shots inside the motel, calling out for someone named \"Alex\".Police were called to the scene but Hoffmann fled in a vehicle.He travelled to Gardens Hill Crescent residential apartments, where he fired more shots before moving to the Buff Club, a pub just metres away.Hoffman continued to the Darwin Recycling Centre and NT Police Headquarters, before travelling in a ute back towards the city centre.Police finally arrested him on a main road into the city, about an hour after the first shots were fired.Four people were killed and a fifth was injured.
