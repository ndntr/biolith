Boyce, who has been in federal parliament since 2022, has previously said the Nationals needed to change direction, and remain in the Coalition to challenge the increasing threat from Pauline Hanson&#x27;s party. He announced last week that he will challenge Littleproud for the leadership of their party, describing the decision to split the Coalition for the second time in a year as \"political suicide\".NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
