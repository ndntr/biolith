READ MORE: Hundreds of Australians potentially impacted after tech giant axes 4000 jobsWA Police Commissioner Col Blanch said communications within an encrypted chat group, alongside the manifesto, were \"concerning\" and disturbing in their content. \"[They contained] white supremacy ideology, anti-Muslim ideology, antisemitism, and quite frankly, abhorrent conversations about minorities and other races in this community,\" Blanch said at a press conference in Perth this afternoon.\"Most concerningly, there was a notebook that outlined preparations for a terrorist attack at significant locations.\"READ MORE: Dangerous conditions feared as city braces for a major deluge Authorities, including the counter-terrorism team and the Australian Federal Police, were tipped off to the communications in the chat group, and started an investigation in January, which led to a search of a house in Bindoon, in the Wheatbelt region, yesterday. Police said they found seven firearms, fake weapons, as well as a ballistics vest, gas masks, and lock-picking equipment at the house, which the man shared with his parents.They also seized several electronic devices, which are still being investigated.Police said they believe the man was acting alone and that there is no current threat to the community.READ MORE: Parents charged with domestic violence manslaughter of three-year-old son Blanch said the man was not known to authorities before his arrest, and that the firearms were owned legally. Premier Roger Cook said the man&#x27;s alleged intentions were \"deeply concerning\". He praised the work of police to act quickly and \"prevent an alleged act of terror in our city\".\"To attack the heart of our democracy, to attack our freedom of religion, to attack those who keep us safe,\" he said of the man&#x27;s alleged plans. \"The threats are real in our community, we must not let hate and division win.\"He said Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had been briefed. The 20-year-old man was charged with one count of act in preparation for a terrorist act, the first time the charge has been used in the state. He&#x27;s also charged with use of a carriage service to menace or harass, possess prohibited weapon, failed to store a firearm or related thing in compliant storage, and unlicensed ammunition.READ MORE: Kids&#x27; message to killer dad: &#x27;I forgive him but I will never forget what he did&#x27;The man appeared in Perth Magistrates Court this afternoon and was refused bail.Blanch said he could be facing life imprisonment if found guilty of the charges.It comes just a month after a man carried out an alleged attempted terrorist attack on an Invasion Day rally in Perth&#x27;s CBD.Liam Alexander Hall, 31, allegedly threw a bomb containing volatile chemicals, nails and metal ball bearings into a crowd of people.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
