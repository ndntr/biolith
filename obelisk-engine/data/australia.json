          "content": "Australia&#x27;s largest gun buyback scheme since the aftermath of the 1996 Port Arthur massacre will be launched in the wake of the Bondi Beach terror attack.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the scheme this morning, saying it is expected to lead to the seizure and destruction of hundreds of thousands of \"surplus, newly banned and illegal\" firearms.\"The terrible events at Bondi show we need to get more guns off our streets,\" he said.READ MORE: Police believe seven men arrested in Sydney raid had &#x27;extremist Islamic ideology&#x27; \"We know that one of these terrorists held a firearm licence and had six guns, in spite of living in the middle of Sydney&#x27;s suburbs there at Bonnyrigg.\"There&#x27;s no reason why someone in that situation needed that many guns.\"There are now more than 4 million firearms in Australia - more than at the time of the Port Arthur massacre nearly 30 years ago.\" The cost of the buyback will be evenly split between the federal and state governments.As in 1996, states will be responsible for collecting the guns, while the Australian Federal Police will be tasked with destroying them.READ MORE: New details emerge about Sajid and Naveed Akram&#x27;s Philippines trip The buyback will help enforce the changes to firearm control laws agreed to by national cabinet earlier this week, which will include limiting the number of weapons one person can own, bringing forward the National Firearms Register, and restricting gun licences to Australian citizens.That overhaul comes after one of the shooters, 50-year-old Sajid Akram, legally owned six long-arm firearms, some of which were used to carry out Sunday&#x27;s massacre.He was granted an AB gun licence in NSW in 2023, despite his son having been investigated – and cleared – by ASIO over potential extremist links years earlier. Any changes to federal laws are unlikely to face any trouble getting through parliament, with Labor holding a comfortable majority in the lower house and needing only the support of the Greens to get the assent of the Senate .READ MORE: Man banned from Bondi after Jewish &#x27;threat&#x27; mid-flight Senior Coalition figures, though, have signalled their opposition to changes to gun laws, with Nationals leader David Littleproud labelling them a \"cheap political smokescreen\".However, Albanese said Australians understood the need for gun controls to be modernised.\"In 1996, the then-Howard government did the right thing: intervened to have a scheme which Australians have been rightly proud of,\" he said.\"We need to go further... if a bloke in Bonnyrigg needs six high-powered rifles and is able to get them under existing licensing schemes, then there&#x27;s something wrong.\"I think Australians can see that.\"READ MORE: The Sydney suburbs with the most registered gun licence holders NSW details stronger gun laws Having already promised to recall parliament before Christmas to pass stronger state gun laws, NSW Premier Chris Minns and Police Minister Yasmin Catley detailed exactly what those controls will include.Licensed residents will be limited to owning four guns each, although there will be some exceptions for farmers, other primary producers, and sporting shooters.Category A and B licences will now only cover magazines with a capacity of 5-10 rounds, while some guns will be upgraded so they can only be obtained under a category C licence.READ MORE: Teen girl takes bullet while shielding two toddlers in Bondi attack \"Will reclassify straight, pull, pump-action, button, lever release firearms into category C - limiting their access primarily to farmers, agriculture, and primary producers,\" Minns said.The state will also enforce more frequent licence renewals and stronger identity checks.\"People need to remember: owning a gun is a privilege, it is not a right,\" Catley said.\"That privilege must never, ever outweigh community safety.\"These reforms ensure there is no ambiguity when it comes to public safety.\"They strengthen oversight, reduce the availability of high-risk firearms, and give the police the tools that they need to intervene as early as possible. \"The new legislation will be introduced to NSW parliament on Monday.

          "content": "The seven men arrested following a dramatic operation in Sydney&#x27;s south-west yesterday will soon be released if there is not enough evidence, police say.Five men were arrested after a car was rammed by tactical police on the corner of George and Campbell streets in Liverpool, just across the road from a busy Westfield shopping centre, with two men stopped in a second car nearby.Police said they had received information that \"a violent act was possibly being planned\" but they had not found any connection \"to the current police investigation into the Bondi terror attack\".\"They haven&#x27;t been released at this stage, we&#x27;re still reviewing evidence to determine whether there&#x27;s a justification to detain them,\" NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said.\"It&#x27;s a thorough investigation. We will have to release the men if we don&#x27;t have sufficient evidence.\"Lanyon confirmed the men travelled from Victoria, and investigators were \"certainly looking at\" radical Islamic extremism as \"one of the ideologies\" potentially motivating the men who were known to Victorian Police.\"Whilst this specific threat posed by the males is unknown, I can say that the potential of a violent offence being committed was such that we were not prepared to tolerate the risk and interdict accordingly,\" Lanyon said.\"The information received was that Bondi may have been one of a number of locations that the males were intending to attend, but the reason for attending is unknown.\"LIVE UPDATES: Incredible scenes as hundreds paddle out at Bondi BeachThis morning, NSW Police Deputy Commissioner David Hudson told the ABC the men may have shared beliefs with the father and son behind Sunday&#x27;s terror attack and confirmed the cars may have been travelling to Bondi.\"We have some indication that Bondi was one of the locations they might be visiting yesterday, but with no specific intent in mind or proven at this stage,\" he said.When asked whether the men had links to \"extremist Islamic ideology\", Hudson replied: \"That&#x27;s our belief at this stage, yes\".Hudson earlier told 2GB radio the potential of the men travelling to Bondi was part of the reason for the police in tervention.\"That did cause us some concern, obviously, and was one of the escalating factors that caused the interdiction yesterday,\" Hudson said.\"But I can confirm no firearms or weapons were located at the vehicle stop.\"Police have not established any definitive link to the individuals involved in the Bondi mass shooting at this stage.\"However, there is an environment that is quite small, and certain ideologies and beliefs are limited to a very small group of people,\" Hudson said. \"So whilst there&#x27;s no definitive links, that&#x27;s part of our investigation which hopefully gets better defined by the end of the day.\"Police applied for a Commonwealth detention order, which allows officers to hold the men for 24 hours without charge.READ MORE: Inside the Akrams&#x27; $22 a night Philippine hotelVideo footage from the operation shows police – armed with long-arm guns, and wearing camouflage fatigues, body armour and helmets – arresting, searching and handcuffing the men yesterday afternoon.It appeared that the men&#x27;s car had been intercepted and rammed to a stop.One of the arrested men was seen on a stretcher, with a bloodied face and bandages around his head.\"Tactical Operations police responded to information received that a violent act was possibly being planned,\" NSW Police said in a statement.\"Police subsequently intercepted two cars as part of the investigation.\"As investigations continue, seven men are assisting police with their inquiries.\"At this point in time, police have not identified any connection to the current police investigation of the Bondi terror attack.\" DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
