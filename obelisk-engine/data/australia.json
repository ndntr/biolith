The Refugee Action Coalition met up with a pro-Palestine march in Hyde Park.NSW Premier Chris Minns earlier aimed to calm Sydneysiders ahead of a busy and potentially tense day, with the Sydney Marathon happening earlier.\"I don&#x27;t want to unnecessarily worry people,\" Minns said.\"I think that the police over the last two years have shown an expert level of both organising the city, allowing people to have their say and demonstrate whilst keeping the public safe.\"I&#x27;ve got confidence in their ability.\"That confidence isn&#x27;t blind trust, they&#x27;ve been doing this for the last two years.\" Clashes between groups In Melbourne, there were several scuffles between groups, though the affiliations of those involved remain unclear.Police had tried to push the counter-protest – which included marchers from the weekly Free Palestine rally – west up Collins Street and away from the March for Australia demonstration, according to The Age.All of Melbourne city was declared a designated area, meaning police had the power to search people for weapons.They could also ask people to remove hoods or masks and ask them to leave an area.The red ensign that is flown at sea by Australian-registered ships was also being carried by some marchers.The flag has also been adopted by anti-government protesters as a symbol, and became more widespread during the COVID-19 lockdown protests. In several shots, the flag was seen displayed upside down, which is considered to be a declaration the country is in distress - ships in trouble at sea will fly their flag upside down as a signal.READ MORE: Sydney Marathon under way as 35,000 people run through harbour cityAnti-immigration protests condemned The protests have been widely condemned by leaders on all sides of politics. Victoria Premier Jacinta Allan, speaking at a multicultural gala last night, said the marches were un-Australian.\"Australia isn&#x27;t a place where we walk with Nazis,\" she said.\"Australia is a place that went to war with Nazis, and the Australian flag is a symbol of our victory and their defeat. \"She said she was \"concerned\" but not \"afraid\" of the consequences of the marches. Victoria&#x27;s shadow police minister David Southwick also spoke out against the march.\"At the moment, we are seeing resources pulled from everywhere to deal with the manhunt that&#x27;s currently in place, and the government should be standing up and saying &#x27;no protest&#x27;.\"READ MORE: Accused driver &#x27;very sorry&#x27; after deadly alleged hit-runFederal opposition leader Sussan Ley called on marchers to stay peaceful.\"There is no place for violence, racism or intimidation, whether incited from afar or stirred up here,\" she said.\"We cannot let hatred and fear tear at our social cohesion.\"DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
