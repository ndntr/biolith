Police do not know if it is one person or multiple people potentially concealing Freeman&#x27;s location.\"People know the whereabouts of the person who has killed two cops,\" he added.\"We are absolutely hunting for a fugitive and we will continue to do so.\"A mobile police facility has been set up in Bright, around 5km from Porepunkah, to gather information from the public. Kahan confirmed police are still operating under the assumption Freeman is alive.He said specialist resources have scoured \"every neck of the woods\". \"There&#x27;s certain areas in and around that dense forestland, which we know has previously been populated by the fugitive,\" he said.Manhunt enters seventh day Police are still yet to close in on accused gunman Freeman as the manhunt for the alleged cop killer enters its seventh day.Bulletproof Bearcat armoured police vehicles were seen entering Mount Buffalo National Park overnight.Freeman has not been seen since two police officers were killed and a third was wounded in a shooting ambush at his Porepunkah property on August 26.The so-called \"sovereign citizen\" is alleged to have opened fire on a group of 10 police as they attempted to execute a search warrant related to alleged historic child sex offences.READ MORE: Protesters clash as anti-immigration rallies take over major citiesDetective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart were killed and a third officer seriously wounded.Police have said Freeman remains armed with multiple guns and is skilled in bushcraft.Yesterday, the fugitive&#x27;s wife, Amalia Freeman, issued a statement through her lawyer calling on Dezi Freeman - also known as Desmond Filby - to hand himself in.READ MORE: Houthis storm UN building after Israel killed PM and other ministers \"I lend my full support to Victoria Police in their search for my husband and will co-operate with Victoria Police in any way that I can,\" she said.\"Please Dezi, if you see or hear this, call 000 and arrange a surrender plan with the police.\"If anyone is harbouring, helping or supporting Dezi, please call 000 immediate and speak with the police. \"READ MORE: Funeral dates set for two police officers killed in Porepunkah ambush Amalia Freeman said she felt \"deep sorrow\" over the deaths of Thompson and De Waart and that neither she nor her children held anti-authority views.A former outlaw bikie in the area, Stephen Mallett, was charged with weapons and drug offences on Friday but denied having ever met Freeman.

          "content": "Independent MPs want to regulate e-bikes to make them safer, including having them classed as road vehicles and mandating speed limiters.Mackellar MP Dr Sophie Scamps introduced the Safer E-Bikes Bill 2025 to parliament today, calling for national safety and import standards as the popularity of electric bikes and associated injuries skyrockets.\"We now have e-bikes that are more like motorbikes that are used on our roads and footpaths,\" Scamps said.READ MORE: Armoured cars enter national park in manhunt for Dezi Freeman\"This bill is about ensuring the e-bikes imported into Australia are both safe and legal for use and cannot be tampered with to make them go beyond legal speed limits except for specific special purposes.\"Currently, the regulation of e-bikes falls to state governments.The legislation would classify e-bikes as road vehicles bringing them under the Road Vehicle Standards Act and create a national safety standard matching European levels.According to research by St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, more than 500 e-bike riders required critical care in New South Wales emergency departments in a two-year period. \"These injuries are often severe including head trauma, spinal injuries and fractures,\" Scamps said.The bill has the support of fellow independent Wentworth MP Allegra Spender.\"At the moment, the line between assisted pedal bikes and motorbikes is blurred and this is at the risk of pedestrians,\" Spender said in a statement.\"This is not about cracking down on this increasingly popular mode of transport but we do need to ensure that we have appropriate standards that keep both riders and pedestrians safe.\" The legislation also has the support of the bicycle sector. According to Peter Bourke, the General Manager of Bicycle Industries Australia, changes in 2021 allowed the importation of significant numbers of non-compliant e-bikes.\"We must ensure e-bikes sold to the public cannot be tampered with to increase speed and that the entire bike is subject to a compulsory &#x27;whole-of-bike&#x27; standard we know will keep children, riders and pedestrians safe,\" he said.Communications minister Anika Wells was not enthusiastic about seeing the legislation brought to a vote.\"I am wheely excited to see those teals come peddling up the hill, but I&#x27;ll be focusing on federal laws today,\" she said.Liberal Senator Jane Hume shared her lack of enthusiasm.\"If the federal government is spending its time talking about bike riding, we&#x27;ve lost our way,\" Hume said.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

          "content": "South Australia Police are investigating after a sign depicting accused Victorian Police killer Dezi Freeman was displayed at Adelaide&#x27;s March for Australia rally.The sign, held up by an unknown protester, showed a n image of Freeman with the caption \"FREE MAN\" underneath, with the words separated by a stylised Southern Cross.Freeman has been identified as being associated with the sovereign citizen movement, and is currently on the run and suspected of killing two police officers in an ambush at his regional Victorian home in Porepunkah. READ MORE: Accused cop killer sign appears at anti-immigration rallyPolice slammed the sign as offensive – but not illegal – and one of the protest&#x27;s organisers said it was \"ridiculous\" and \"unacceptable\".Acting commissioner Linda Williams said officers became aware of the man with the sign through the city&#x27;s CCTV network.\"Police were deployed into the crowd, but by the time police arrived on that area, we couldn&#x27;t see him and the sign had disappeared,\" Williams said.\"But our inquiries are well advised, so I would urge him before we find him if he wants to hand himself into a police station so we can have a chat with them about that sign .\"SA Premier Peter Malinauskas urged the sign holder to speak with police. \"This is not who we are as a state,\" Malinauskas said.Many rallies saw clashes between left- and right-wing activists and Melbourne witnessed the most arrests as violence erupted in the streets.Emotions were heightened as March for Australia protesters turned out in force in almost every capital city calling for limits to migration.Self-declared neo-Nazis took to the stage at some point at several of the protests, prompting discomfort from some of the crowd and condemnation from organisers.Counter-protesters also made their voices heard.\"[It&#x27;s] trying to be disguised as something patriotic when they&#x27;re actually something quite hateful,\" one said.Prem ier&#x27;s message to protestersFollowing the protests, Malinauskas said the protesters were naive about the state and nation&#x27;s history.\"2.4 per cent of the South Australian population is Indigenous, that means that 97.6 per cent of South Australians have an immigrant heritage,\" he said.\"I&#x27;m proud of mine and I think most South Australians are proud of theirs.\"Let me make this perfectly clear, the overwhelming majority of South Australians don&#x27;t just tolerate diversity and multiculturalism, we celebrate it.\"It is part of who we are, it is not just something that is part of our social fabric, it is the very essence of our social fabric.\"Malinauskas also praised the many people who have migrated to Australia for their \"magnificent\" contributions.\"My message to multicultural communities around the state is you are very much a critical piece of our social infrastructure, you add to our state and most South Australians are exceptionally grateful for it,\" he said.\"But the people who are protesting today would do well to familiarise themselves with our own history, instead they seek to diminish and deny it in a way that is unbecoming to them.\"Arrests and pepper spray in Melbourne Twelve people were arrested after rival protest groups clashed in the heart of Melbourne as outnumbered police tried desperately to keep them apart and away from passersby. Pepper spray wasn&#x27;t enough to separate thousands of protesters as a chaotic game of cat and mouse occupied the streets for more than seven hours.Footage shows the two sides clashing and shouting at each other.They gathered in their thousands at Flinders Street draped in Australian flags.One of those flags was burnt and both anti-immigration marchers and counter-protesters threw bottles, spitting at and slapping each other as they evaded a thin blue line that was already stretched by the manhunt in Victoria&#x27;s high country.READ MORE: The global &#x27;chaos&#x27; pushing two economic titans closerOne protester pushing for an end to \"mass immigration\" claimed it wasn&#x27;t about race.\"If you come here you respect the country. You respect the culture. You adapt and be one of us. We&#x27;re all brothers,\" another said.But behind genuine displays of pride, known neo-Nazis were taking control.Thomas Sewell, a self-proclaimed white nationalist was given the prime speaking spot from the steps of parliament.\"Today our men stood at the front of the march and when the Palestinians and the communists came charging at the Aussie flags it was our men that fought back,\" he said.He was flanked by dozens of members of his Neo-Nazi National Socialist Network who led a crowd of thousands down Bourke Street turning some of the city&#x27;s most famous landmarks into props for their hateful ideology.Before the march they turned on each other, attacking right-wing podcaster Avi Yemini and his security entourage.\"They&#x27;re there to promote hate in the community, to blame people for their gripes and their complaints and their whinges, and they&#x27;re just unhinged grubs,\" Police Minister Anthony Carbines said.As the violence escalated from both sides, Nine&#x27;s own cameraman was knocked to the ground as a protester tried - and failed - to steal his equipment.Six arrests were made and two police officers were injured after being hit by bottles thrown at them.Arrests hours after protests in SydneyWhile only one person was arrested during the protests in Sydney, two people police believed were involved in the earlier rally were charged after allegedly assaulting an officer during a brawl in the CBD.Police were called to the Broadway bar about 5.15pm in response to reports a group of people at the bar were yelling offensively at passersby and a brawl kicked off.They said the officer suffered minor injuries in an assault as police tried to break it up and two men, aged 29 and 48, were arrested.They were this morning charged with affray, assaulting police and resisting police in the execution of duty, to appear in court this morning.Police allege the 49-year-old assaulted a male constable, who the younger man also assaulted when police tried to arrest the older man.Footage shows officers using pepper spray then making the arrests, and a shirtless man is filmed struggling with police before seeming to get away.Mobile phone vision has also emerged of a protester with an Australian flag clashing with a passenger on a train at Redfern station, seemingly another hangover of a highly charged day.The earlier arrest, in Hyde Park, involved a woman allegedly breaching the peace. She was taken to Day Street police Station.Organisers of the rallies had called for there to be no violence and denied any links to neo-Nazis.NSW Police Acting Assistant Commissioner Scott Tanner said it was an \"amazing effort\" from police.\"There&#x27;s no further investigations into any matters that occurred today,\" he said.Thousands of people gathered at Belmore Park in the city for the rally.\"We are not a racist country, we just want a good calibre of people here in here,\" one woman said.They are calling for limits or an end to migration.There was a huge police presence with several hundred funnelling the march down Broadway.There were fears that the march could be hijacked by neo-Nazi hate groups and they were there front and centre leading the march.Members of a White Australia group were there with their leader Jack Eltis.\"But we are here because anti-immigration is our key political issue,\" he told 9News. When asked if the group was racist he replied: \"Yeah we are racist. We are proud of who we are as white men, we built this nation.\"He also confirmed the group&#x27;s members were \"neo-Nazis\". The front of the march might have presented one picture but the bulk of those marching behind appeared to be anything but extremistAt the end, at an open mic session the White Australia group seized control.It was a hate speech and wasn&#x27;t winning over the majority of the crowd.When the speaker was finished, police ushered the group away.A few blocks away a march by the Refugee Action Coalition was a counter-protest condemning the White Australia group.DOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP: Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.
