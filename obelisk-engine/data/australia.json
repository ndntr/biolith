          "content": "Homemade food products that may still be circulating in the community are believed to be behind a cluster of rat poisoning cases in Queensland&#x27;s south-east.Queensland Health has issued an alert for people to be aware of two homemade, unlabelled products - a homemade capsicum and chilli paste and a homemade marinated eggplant containing a capsicum and chilli paste - that may be circulating in Logan.The alert comes after five people from Logan , including a child, went to hospitals last week with symptoms consistent with having ingested brodifacoum, a common ingredient in rat poison.READ MORE: Thunderstorms and heatwaves to hit across Australia this weekend After an investigation with Queensland Police, Queensland Health has found three of those five people had consumed these homemade products and product samples have tested positive for brodifacoum.These food items may have been purchased or gifted in the Logan area from mid-September onwards.Anyone who has these products at home is advised to throw them away immediately in the bin, so that animals cannot get to them.Queensland Health has advised the Logan community be alert for symptoms consistent with brodifacoum poisoning, particularly if they may have consumed products recently matching the description.Chief Health Officer Dr Catherine McDougall said there did not appear to be broad risk to the community.\"No other possible cases of brodifacoum poisoning have been identified since the five individuals were reported last week,\" Dr McDougall said.\"The identified products are homemade and do not appear to be widely distributed. It is believed they are available only very locally in the Logan community.\"We do not believe there is a widespread risk to the broader community however we encourage people in the Logan area to be alert.\"The investigation remains ongoing, we are continuing to make further enquiries and will keep the community updated.\"If people believe they may have consumed the identified products or are experiencing bleeding that can&#x27;t otherwise be explained, they should visit their local GP, local satellite hospital or urgent care clinic for testing, or call 13 HEALTH for further advice.Brodifacoum is the active ingredient in rat poison that inhibits Vitamin K, which is essential for blood to clot. It can cause bleeding-related complications if ingested by humans.Symptoms include bleeding gums, unexplained bruises, blood in urine or stool and swelling of joints.",
