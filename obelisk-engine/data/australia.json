Later, Trump warmly endorsed AUKUS when he hosted Albanese at the White House, saying it was \"full steam ahead\".NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
