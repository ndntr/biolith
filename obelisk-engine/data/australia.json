Albanese and Allan have seen the devastation first hand and announced a multimillion-dollar relief package.They visited the small town of Harcourt, which has been devastated. A combined $19.5 million from the state and commonwealth has been put up to cover counselling, start the clean-up and provide emergency cash.\"This is a one-off, immediate payment of $1000 per eligible adult and $400 per child who&#x27;ve been severely affected,\" Albanese said.READ MORE: Family airlifted from bushfire after sheltering in shipping container \"We&#x27;ve got your back.

And I feel like I kind of never existed. Everything&#x27;s gone,\" she said.Another 150 were lost in Longwood and 30 more in Natimuk.Across Victoria, 350 thousand hectares have been burnt.Allan warned that will increase.Officials say it&#x27;ll take weeks to fully understand the extent of the damage with many spots still too dangerous to access even for trained crews.But it hasn&#x27;t stopped others trying to pass roadblocks to see it for themselves.\"These are not places for visitors, spectators, tourists,\" Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch said.\"It is wrong to go into these firegrounds where it&#x27;s unsafe and you don&#x27;t belong there - and you will be dealt with by Victoria Police,\" Allan said.",
