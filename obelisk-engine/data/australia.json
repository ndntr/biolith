          "content": "Journalist Don Lemon was released from custody on Friday (local time) after he was arrested and hit with federal civil rights charges over his coverage of an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a Minnesota church.Lemon was arrested overnight in Los Angeles, while another independent journalist and two protest participants were arrested in Minnesota. He struck a confident, defiant tone while speaking to reporters after a court appearance in California, declaring: \"I will not be silenced.\"READ MORE: Beloved actress Catherine O&#x27;Hara dies, aged 71 \"I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now,\" Lemon said.\"In fact there is no more important time than right now, this very moment, for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable.\"The arrests brought sharp criticism from news media advocates and civil rights activists including the Rev Al Sharpton, who said the Trump administration is taking a \"sledgehammer\" to \"the knees of the First Amendment.\"A grand jury in Minnesota indicted Lemon and others on charges of conspiracy and interfering with the First Amendment rights of worshippers during the January 18 protest at the Cities Church in St. Paul, where a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor.In court in Los Angeles, Assistant US Attorney Alexander Robbins argued for a $143,000 ($US100,000) bond, telling a judge that Lemon \"knowingly joined a mob that stormed into a church.\" He was released, however, without having to post money and was granted permission to travel to France in June while the case is pending.READ MORE: Elon Musk asked to visit Jeffrey Epstein&#x27;s island for his &#x27;wildest party&#x27; Defense attorney Marilyn Bednarski said Lemon plans to plead not guilty and fight the charges in Minnesota.Lemon, who was fired from CNN in 2023 following a bumpy run as a morning host, has said he has no affiliation to the organisation that went into the church and he was there as a solo journalist chronicling protesters.\"Don has been a journalist for 30 years, and his constitutionally protected work in Minneapolis was no different than what he has always done,\" his lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement earlier on Friday.Attorney General Pam Bondi promoted the arrests on social media.\"Make no mistake. Under President Trump&#x27;s leadership and this administration, you have the right to worship freely and safely,\" Bondi said in a video posted online.\"And if I haven&#x27;t been clear already, if you violate that sacred right, we are coming after you.\"READ MORE: List of Trump allegations released in Epstein files &#x27;Keep trying&#x27;Since he left CNN, Lemon has joined the legion of journalists who have gone into business for himself, posting regularly on YouTube. He hasn&#x27;t hidden his disdain for President Donald Trump. Yet during his online show from the church, he said repeatedly: \"I&#x27;m not here as an activist. I&#x27;m here as a journalist.\" He described the scene before him, and interviewed churchgoers and demonstrators.A magistrate judge last week rejected prosecutors&#x27; initial bid to charge Lemon. Shortly after, he predicted on his show that the administration would try again.READ MORE: Dragging Melbourne roadworks threaten to put locals out of jobs \"And guess what,\" he said. \"Here I am.

Because I&#x27;m not going anywhere.\"Georgia Fort livestreamed the moments before her arrest, telling viewers that agents were at her door and her First Amendment right as a journalist was being diminished.A judge released Fort, Trahern Crews and Jamael Lundy on bond, rejecting the Justice Department&#x27;s attempt to keep them in custody. Not guilty pleas were entered. Fort&#x27;s supporters in the courtroom clapped and whooped.\"It&#x27;s a sinister turn of events in this country,\" Fort&#x27;s attorney, Kevin Riach, said in court.READ MORE: Man charged after allegedly posing as casting agent in Sydney Discouraging scrutinyJane Kirtley, a media law and ethics expert at the University of Minnesota, said the federal laws cited by the government were not intended to apply to reporters gathering news.The charges against Lemon and Fort, she said, are \"pure intimidation and government overreach.\"Some experts and activists said the charges were not only an attack on press freedoms but also a strike against Black Americans who count on Black journalists to bear witness to injustice and oppression.The National Association of Black Journalists said it was \"outraged and deeply alarmed\" by Lemon&#x27;s arrest. The group called it an effort to \"criminalize and threaten press freedom under the guise of law enforcement.\"Crews is a leader of Black Lives Matter Minnesota who has led many protests and actions for racial justice, particularly following George Floyd&#x27;s killing in Minneapolis in 2020.\"All the greats have been to jail, MLK, Malcom X — people who stood up for justice get attacked,\" Crews told The Associated Press. \"We were just practicing our First Amendment rights.\"Protesters charged previouslyA prominent civil rights attorney and two other people involved in the protest were arrested last week. Prosecutors have accused them of civil rights violations for disrupting the Cities Church service.The Justice Department launched an investigation after the group interrupted services by chanting \"ICE out\" and \"Justice for Renee Good,\" referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis.Lundy works for the office of Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty and is married to a St. Paul City Council member. Lemon briefly interviewed him as they gathered with protesters preparing to drive to the church on January 18.\"I feel like it&#x27;s important that if you&#x27;re going to be representing people in office that you are out here with the people,\" Lundy told Lemon, adding he believed in \"direct action, certainly within the lines of the law.\"Church leaders praise arrests in protestCities Church belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention and lists one of its pastors as David Easterwood, who leads ICE&#x27;s St. Paul field office.\"We are grateful that the Department of Justice acted swiftly to protect Cities Church so that we can continue to faithfully live out the church&#x27;s mission to worship Jesus and make him known,\" lead pastor Jonathan Parnell said.READ MORE: MP &#x27;beyond angry&#x27; over death of brother in alleged one-punch attack NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
