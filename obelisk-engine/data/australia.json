Driver Nathan told 3AW the woman was crossing the road when she was struck by the allegedly stolen car. \"It pulled in front of me, it then hit a pedestrian that was crossing on a green man,\" he said.\"It flew her off... she hit the side. I&#x27;ve slowed down but there would have been 10 or 15 other pedestrians crossing that helped her up.\" A BMW, which police allege was stolen yesterday from Boroondara, east Melbourne, was then dumped a short time later at Bourke Street Mall, which does not permit cars.Four occupants of the car then fled the scene on foot. They were arrested a short time later outside Emporium Melbourne shopping centre on Lonsdale Street.Two 17-year-old boys, a 16-year-old boy and a 15-year-old boy are being interviewed by police.One witness told 9News that shoppers and business owners feared for their lives as the BMW was allegedly seen speeding down tram tracks about 1pm.\"I t was just mayhem... people coming around from everywhere,\" he said.\"People were a bit disorientated as to what [was] going on. Shops started to shut their doors because they were in fear that maybe they would come in.\"Another witness described the incident as \"shocking\".\"You know, you think these things will never happen here in Melbourne, but it is now,\" he said. A fellow pedestrian told 9News it was lucky nobody died as people were forced to jump out of the way of the moving car.\"They could have killed someone in the intersection,\" witness Vince said.\"Next minute this car has come straight down and I thought, thank God we weren&#x27;t walking in the middle of Bourke Street Mall.\" Another said the incident had haunting similarities to the deadly 2017 Bourke Street attack, which saw driver James Gargasoulas kill six and injure 27 after ploughing into pedestrians.\" Bourke Street all over again. Literally,\" he told 9News.A witness told 3AW she earlier saw what appeared to be a white BMW with smashed windows travelling down Punt Road in South Yarra. Another caller named Craig said multiple police cars were seen heading down Elizabeth Street as the incident unfolded. \"There&#x27;s police cars absolutely everywhere. They&#x27;re coming rolling down Elizabeth Street, up the wrong side of the road,\" he said.\"Cops everywhere, all running into Melbourne Central [Shopping Centre].\"I&#x27;ve never seen so many police cars in my life.\"Two tram routes were delayed due to the incident. Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan described it as \"disgraceful, dangerous behaviour\".\"Victorians won&#x27;t tolerate it and neither will we,\" Allan said.Car allegedly stolen from Balwyn familyAndy Tran told 9News his BMW was stolen from his home early this morning.He said the alleged offenders broke in to his Balwyn, in Melbourne&#x27;s east, while six people slept – including a 12-year-old.\"We were quite lucky but we&#x27;ve got young kids, we&#x27;ve got [an] elderly mum, so a bit traumatised,\" he said.Tran said his mother-in-law heard a commotion but didn&#x27;t get up to confront the intruders.\"She heard the noise around 1.30ish and then thought it was just us,\" he added.He alleges the offenders also stole a wallet, keys and a mobile phone.9News understands police are investigating whether the same group is responsible for targeting four other homes in the Boorondara area.
