          "content": "Many thousands have swarmed Flinders Street in Melbourne in a mass protest against Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who made appearances across the city today as he concluded his Australian visit.Flinders Street was blocked to trams and traffic as demonstrators marched down Swanston Street to parliament, accusing Herzog of being a war criminal. Victoria Police said about 10,000 people had gathered outside Flinders Street Station whilst organisers put the number at 30,000.\"We are here today because our government has invited someone who is on trial for incitement of genocide against a population of 2 million besieged Palestinians in Gaza,\" organiser Noura Mansour said.READ MORE: Special Envoy appointed to pursue investigations into Laos methanol poisoning deaths\"We reject this visit, we reject genocide and we reject the very values that this unwelcomed guest represent.\"Police said there were no significant public order issues and special powers granted for the day&#x27;s events had not been used.A 39-year-old Coburg North man was interviewed during the afternoon rally and released pending summons for assault police.\"The police officer was not physically injured during the incident,\" police said.Herzog was on his way back to Jerusalem tonight following four days of engagements with dignitaries, Bondi terror attack survivors and members of the Jewish community.The president touched down in Melbourne under heavy police guard for the last day of his Australian tour.The president flew into Tullamarine on an RAAF jet this morning ahead of a number of official engagements.Escorted by a police convoy, Herzog arrived at Government House just before midday, where he met with Governor Margaret Gardner and Premier Jacinta Allan.Police quickly shut down a demonstration by a small group of protesters outside the grounds of Government House.This afternoon Herzog addressed a crowd of supporters in Southbank, directly referencing widespread protests that have shadowed his visit.Dozens of police barricaded City Road in front of a large fence, close to a Zionist Federation of Australia-hosted event where the president spoke to community members.The final engagement in Herzog&#x27;s visit, the event was sold as \"an afternoon of reflection, unity and shared purpose\".Allan, Opposition Leader Jess Wilson and victims of the Bondi terror attack attended the event, alongside scores of Victorian Jews.A small group of pro-Palestine protesters demonstrated near the blockade, including several people dressed as police officers, demanding the arrest of Herzog.\"We have an international war criminal that is being currently protected by our local boys. It&#x27;s a problem,\" one protester said.The pro-Palestine group briefly interacted with a small number of counter-protesters waving Israeli flags, but the demonstration appeared largely peaceful.READ MORE: Liberal leadership spill confirmed ahead of partyroom meeting where Angus Taylor will challenge Sussan LeyInside the event, Herzog urged protesters outside to \"go protest in front of the Iranian embassy\", citing internal conflict that has seen tens of thousands of Iran&#x27;s own citizens killed.\"To me it&#x27;s obscure and odd that we need to have so many incredible police officers protecting us for the inherent right for us to gather here as proud Jews... to host the president of the only Jewish state on earth, without any harassment,\" Herzog said.The Israeli dignitary offered a wider message of hope to the crowd, noting that he hoped his visit would \"console\" the community and \"salute the many heroes of Bondi\".\"The resolve and solidarity of this community are key to the future that we all share in Melbourne and in Jerusalem,\" he said. \"We came to remind you that you are not alone here in the diaspora, and we leave understanding more than ever before that we have each other.\"Premier condemns anti-Herzog graffiti The words \"Death To Herzog + Israel + Oz\" were scrawled across the University of Melbourne&#x27;s Parkville Campus in black spray paint alongside an inverted triangle - a symbol commonly used by pro-Palestine protesters and Hamas militia.READ MORE: Actor James Van Der Beek dies aged 48\"It&#x27;s absolutely contemptible because we all want peace to come and causing hurt and grief and violence like we&#x27;ve seen in Sydney, that does not bring peace,\" Allan said of the graffiti.Victoria Police were out in force across the course of the day, with specialist forces brought in to help maintain safety and avoid a repeat of violent scenes in Sydney on Monday.Yesterday, the Supreme Court granted police special powers to search individuals and vehicles in the vicinity of the president and his convoy.\"Victoria Police has been granted those powers that afford us, in specified areas, to seek the identities of individuals passing through that location, to search individuals, to search vehicles, and to cordon off a particular area,\" Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Regional Operations Bob Hill said yesterday.\"It&#x27;s specific to areas he will visit and it will not directly relate to or impact upon the lawful protest activity that may occur here in Melbourne tomorrow evening.\" READ MORE: FBI searches highways in Nancy Guthrie search as man detained in case releasedNEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
