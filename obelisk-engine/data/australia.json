          "content": "King Charles III offered a rare update on his cancer journey in a video message on Friday evening, revealing that he has responded well to treatment and it will be reduced in the new year.Charles, 77, described the milestone in his recovery process as \"a personal blessing\" before hailing \"the remarkable advances that have been made in cancer care in recent years.\"\"Today I am able to share with you the good news that thanks to early diagnosis, effective intervention and adherence to &#x27;doctor&#x27;s orders,&#x27; my own schedule of cancer treatment can be reduced in the new year,\" the British monarch said in a pre-filmed clip for Channel 4&#x27;s Stand Up To Cancer broadcast, which partners on its annual campaign with the charity Cancer Research UK.READ MORE: Apple issues urgent iPhone update after Triple Zero emergency call testing raises concerns Charles announced he had been diagnosed with cancer in February 2024 after undergoing a prostate procedure.While his treatment is not over, a spokesperson for the King told CNN that \"His Majesty has responded exceptionally well to treatment and his doctors advise that ongoing measures will now move into a precautionary phase.\"The spokesperson added: \"This position will be continuously monitored and reviewed to protect and prioritise his continued recovery.\"In his video message, which was filmed at his London residence of Clarence House in late November, Charles reflected on learning about his diagnosis. He said that he knows it \"can feel overwhelming\" but that he also knows \"early detection is the key that can transform treatment journeys, giving invaluable time to medical teams – and, to their patients, the precious gift of hope.\"He stressed the importance of cancer screening programs and encouraged people to make use of them to catch the disease quickly because \"early diagnosis quite simply saves lives.\"\"Too often, I am told, people avoid screening because they imagine it may be frightening, embarrassing or uncomfortable. If and when they do finally take up their invitation, they are glad they took part,\" he explained, before highlighting a new national Screening Checker, available online in the UK.READ MORE: New photos from Epstein&#x27;s estate show Trump, Clinton, other high-profile people \"This simple tool allows you to check whether you are eligible for breast, bowel or cervical cancer screening. It demystifies the process, answers your questions, and guides you towards taking that crucial step.\"Charles also said that during his own cancer journey he has been \"profoundly moved\" by what he called \"the community of care\" that surrounds every patient.He ended his message with his \"most heartfelt thanks to the doctors, nurses, researchers and charity workers involved in diagnosis and treatment programs, together with my particular good wishes to those for whom they care so selflessly.\"Friday&#x27;s message is the latest example of how the British sovereign has made cancer awareness a fundamental part of his public facing work.His first official engagement following his diagnosis was in April last year when he visited University College Hospital Macmillan Cancer Centre in London, where he met patients and clinicians.The King&#x27;s outing came as he was announced as the new patron of Cancer Research UK. He has also been patron of Macmillan Cancer Support for almost three decades.He also sent a deeply personal message to a Buckingham Palace reception in April honoring the work of cancer charities, saying despite the fears that cancer can bring, it can illuminate the best of humanity.Charles has been praised for his openness around his diagnosis and raising awareness around it. Caroline Geraghty, senior information nurse at Cancer Research UK, commended both Charles and his daughter-in-law Catherine, Princess of Wales, for sharing their experiences with the disease.\"He&#x27;s visited hospitals, he&#x27;s seen patients, he&#x27;s visited support centers. He really has kept in touch with people,\" she told CNN. \"I think he feels, and as do other people, that he&#x27;s got something in common with them. I think them telling us this also highlights the fact that anyone can get cancer. It doesn&#x27;t matter who you are.\"King Charles has not publicly disclosed the type of cancer he has been receiving outpatient treatment for. A royal source told CNN last year that the form of cancer detected was not prostate cancer, but did not specify further.The spokesperson for the King told CNN on Friday that was because \"the advice from cancer experts is that, in his determination to support the whole cancer community, it is preferable that His Majesty does not address his own specific condition but rather speaks to those affected by all forms of the disease.\"It&#x27;s not yet clear how much longer Charles will require treatment; that would be a matter for his medical team to determine.Following his diagnosis last year, the King briefly stepped away from public facing duties, though he continued to carry out state business. He has since returned to a busy diary of engagements and foreign trips.\"The King has taken great comfort and encouragement from being able to continue leading a full and active life throughout his treatment, while always heeding the advice of his medical team,\" his spokesperson told CNN.\"His ability to uphold all of his state duties, and to continue with public engagements and overseas tours, has helped greatly with the positive mindset that, as many families will know, is such a vital part of the recovery journey.\"",

          "content": "Fresh questions are being asked about the expenses federal politicians are allowed to claim and what reviews should be implemented.Despite Prime Minister Anthony Albanese saying this week that the rules governing politicians&#x27; travel allowances were set by the previous government, documents reveal Labor&#x27;s Special Minister of State Don Farrell made an alteration on February 12, just weeks before the federal election was called. That change affected what classified as party political duties and seemingly broadened what politicians might be able to bill taxpayers for when it comes to travel expenses. READ MORE: New Epstein photos &#x27;no big deal&#x27;, says Trump\"It&#x27;s outrageous to change the rules so that the taxpayer can pay for campaigning and political party events,\" independent Senator David Pocock said.\"Clearly the rules are not in line with community expectations and we need to make sure they are in line with what Australians expect.\"Energy Minister Chris Bowen defended the alterations, saying: \"My understanding is that that change was simply a clarification of the rules to make them simpler.\"\"There was no change to what is allowed or not allowed,\" Bowen said.It has also emerged that a review into political expenses was meant to take place this year but was postponed by two years, and now won&#x27;t take place until 2027.READ MORE: CCTV shows shirtless man run from scene after police car rammed The government, at the time of postponing the review, cited disruptions from the federal election as the reason for the delay. Centre for Public Integrity executive director Dr Catherine Williams said changes needed to be made. \"It&#x27;s clear that the rules need to be reviewed so that members of parliament and the public can have confidence that when taxpayer money is being spent on parliamentarians&#x27; travel, it&#x27;s meeting community expectations,\" she said. Albanese has said he&#x27;s seeking advice from the expenses watchdog regarding the legislation.Bowen responded to questions about his colleagues&#x27; expenses during the unveiling of a shakeup of the government&#x27;s home batteries subsidy.Bowen said the subsidy scheme proved \"even more successful than the government originally anticipated\", meaning most of the $2.3 billion set aside for the four-year program would be exhausted within the next year.As a result, the government has splashed an extra $5 billion into the program, but they&#x27;re changing the parameters of the discounts.From May next year, only smaller batteries will receive the full 30 per cent discount.That figure will taper down for larger batteries \"to make sure the program continues to be fair and sustainable\", Bowen said.EV benefits are also set to be reviewed.
