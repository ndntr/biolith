          "content": "Venezuelans are scrambling to understand who is in charge of their country after the US military captured President Nicolás Maduro, ousting the strongman who had outlasted a botched coup attempt, several army mutinies, mass protests and economic sanctions in the vast nation of 29 million.\"What will happen tomorrow?\" asked Juan Pablo Petrone, a resident of Venezuela&#x27;s capital of Caracas. As fear gripped the city, streets quickly emptied save for long lines snaking from supermarkets and gas stations. \"What will happen in the next hour?\"President Donald Trump offered a shocking answer: The United States would take control of Venezuela, perhaps in coordination with one of Maduro&#x27;s most trusted aides.READ MORE: Why is the US attacking Venezuela?Delcy Rodríguez, who is next in the presidential line of succession, served as Maduro&#x27;s vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela&#x27;s oil-dependent economy as well as its feared intelligence service. On Saturday, Venezuela&#x27;s high court ordered her to assume the role of interim president.\"She&#x27;s essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,\" Trump told reporters of Rodríguez, who faced US sanctions during Trump&#x27;s first administration for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.In a major snub, Trump said opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who was awarded last year&#x27;s Nobel Peace Prize, didn&#x27;t have the support to run the country.Trump said Rodríguez had a long conversation with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in which Trump claimed she said, \"&#x27;We&#x27;ll do whatever you need.&#x27;\"\"I think she was quite gracious,\" Trump added.\"We can&#x27;t take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn&#x27;t have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.\"READ MORE: Captured president walked through detention office in New YorkSenior officials remain in placeKey Venezuelan officials appeared to have survived the military operation and held onto their jobs, at least for now. There was no immediate sign that the US was running Venezuela.Rodríguez tried to project strength and unity among the ruling party&#x27;s many factions, downplaying any hint of betrayal. In remarks on state television before the court decision, she demanded the immediate release of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and denounced the US operation as a flagrant violation of the United Nations charter.\"There is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicolás Maduro,\" Rodríguez said, surrounded by top civilian officials and military commanders.Seeking to assuage the jittery public, Venezuelan military officials struck a defiant tone in video messages, lashing out at Trump and vowing to stand up to US pressure.\"They have attacked us but will not break us,\" said Defence Minister General Vladimir Padrino López, dressed in fatigues.READ MORE: Operation Absolute Resolve: The US mission to capture MaduroInterior Minister Diosdado Cabello, among Maduro&#x27;s top enforcers, urged Venezuelans to \"get out on the streets\" to defend the country&#x27;s sovereignty.\"These rats attacked and they will regret what they did,\" he said of the US.Some Venezuelans heeded his call, rallying in support of the government and burning American flags in scattered gatherings across Caracas on Saturday.But most people stayed inside out of fear.\"What&#x27;s happening is unprecedented,\" said Yanire Lucas, another Caracas resident, picking up pieces of glass from an explosion at a nearby military base that blew out the windows of her house.\"We&#x27;re still on edge, and now we&#x27;re unsure what to do.\"READ MORE: Who is Cilia Flores, Maduro&#x27;s wife and &#x27;first combatant&#x27;?No sign of a political transitionTrump indicated that Rodríguez had been sworn in already as president of Venezuela, per the transfer of power outlined in the constitution.But state TV did not broadcast any swearing-in ceremony.During Rodríguez&#x27;s televised speech, a ticker at the bottom of the screen identified her as the vice president. She gave no sign that she would be cooperating with the US, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\"What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,\" she said in her address. \"History and justice will make the extremists who promoted this armed aggression pay.\"The Venezuelan constitution also says a new election must be called within a month in the event of the president&#x27;s absence. But experts have been debating whether the succession scenario would apply here, given the government&#x27;s lack of popular legitimacy and the extraordinary US military intervention.READ MORE: Trump attacked Venezuela and arrested its president. Is that legal?Strong ties with Wall StreetA lawyer educated in Britain and France, Rodríguez has a long history of representing the revolution started by the late Hugo Chávez on the world stage.She and her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, head of the Maduro-controlled National Assembly, have sterling leftist credentials born from tragedy. Their father was a socialist leader who died in police custody in the 1970s, a crime that shook many activists of the era, including a young Maduro.Unlike many in Maduro&#x27;s inner circle, the Rodríguez siblings have avoided criminal indictment in the US.Delcy Rodríguez developed strong ties with Republicans in the oil industry and on Wall Street who balked at the notion of US-led regime change.Among her past interlocutors were Blackwater founder Erik Prince and, more recently, Richard Grenell, a Trump special envoy who tried to negotiate a deal with Maduro for greater US influence in Venezuela.Internal tensions could eruptFluent in English, Rodríguez is sometimes portrayed as a well-educated, market-friendly moderate in contrast to the military hard-liners who took up arms with Chávez against Venezuela&#x27;s democratically elected president in the 1990s.Many of them, especially Cabello, are wanted in the US on drug trafficking charges and stand accused of serious human rights abuses. But they continue to hold sway over the armed forces, the traditional arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela.That presents major challenges to Rodríguez asserting authority. But some analysts said they expected Venezuela&#x27;s power brokers to close ranks, as they&#x27;ve done before.\"These leaders have all seen the value of staying united. Cabello has always taken a second seat or third seat, knowing that his fate is tied up with Maduro&#x27;s, and now he very well might do that again,\" said David Smilde, a sociology professor at Tulane University who has studied Venezuela&#x27;s political dynamics over the past three decades.Much depends on the state of Venezuela&#x27;s military after the US bombing raid, Smilde added. \"If it doesn&#x27;t have much firepower anymore, they&#x27;re more vulnerable and diminished.\"An snub of the oppositionShortly before Trump&#x27;s press conference, Machado, the opposition leader, called on her ally Edmundo González — a retired diplomat widely considered to have won the country&#x27;s disputed 2024 presidential election — to \"immediately assume his constitutional mandate and be recognized as commander-in-chief\".In a triumphant statement, Machado promised that her movement would \"restore order, free political prisoners, build an exceptional country and bring our children back home\".She added: \"Today we are prepared to assert our mandate and take power.\"Trump seemed to throw cold water on those plans.Asked about Machado, Trump was blunt: \"I think it would be very tough for (Machado) to be the leader,\" he said, shocking many Venezuelan viewers who expected Trump&#x27;s talk of liberation to mean a swift democratic transition.\"She doesn&#x27;t have the support or respect within the country.\"Machado has not responded to Trump&#x27;s remarks.",

          "content": "The US mission to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was planned over many months and involved more than 150 aircraft.General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said US intelligence agencies had tracked Maduro to \"understand how he moved, where he lived, where he travelled, what he ate, what he wore\".\"The operation, known as Operation Absolute Resolve, was discreet, precise and conducted during the darkest hours of January 2, and was the culmination of months of planning and rehearsal — an operation that frankly only the United States military could undertake,\" Caine said in a press conference at Mar-a-Lago with US President Donald Trump.READ MORE: Why is the US attacking Venezuela?CNN previously reported that the CIA had installed a small team inside Venezuela over the northern hemisphere summer to keep a close watch on Maduro&#x27;s activities.Caine said Operation Absolute Resolve involved more than 150 aircraft launched from 20 different bases on land and sea.Among them were helicopters carrying an extraction force that began their flight into Venezuela at just 30 metres above the water.The helicopters, safeguarded by a series of strikes carried out in the area, arrived at Maduro&#x27;s compound about 1am ET (5pm AEDT).The effort to capture Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, required multiple \"self defence engagements\" as the forces came under fire, Caine said, before flying out of Venezuela about 3.29am ET (7.29pm AEDT).Maduro and his wife were subsequently transferred to the warship USS Iwo Jima, where they were then on their way to New York to stand trial.READ MORE: Trump says US &#x27;is going to run&#x27; Venezuela after capture of Maduro \"Failure of one component of this well-oiled machine would have endangered the entire mission, and failure is never an option for America&#x27;s joint force,\" Caine said.CNN reports on a source saying \"a handful of troops sustained bullet and shrapnel wounds, but none are life-threatening\".Trump earlier told Fox News that \"a couple of guys were hit. But they came back and they&#x27;re supposed to be in pretty good shape.\"Caine said one US aircraft was struck during the operation, \"but remained flyable\".He also highlighted the role of intelligence teams in supporting the mission in real time.\"Our air and ground intelligence teams provided real time updates to the ground force, ensuring those forces could safely navigate the complex environment without unnecessary risk.\"Maduro was &#x27;trying to get into safe place&#x27;Trump said Maduro could have been killed.\"It could have happened,\" he said.\"He was trying to get into a safe place. You know, the safe place&#x27;s all steel, and he wasn&#x27;t able to make it to the door because our guys were so fast.\"The US military \"went through the opposition so fast\", Trump said, while also noting that \"there was a lot of opposition\".READ MORE: Venezuelan president and wife on US warship heading to New York.

          "content": "US President Donald Trump announced early on Saturday morning (Saturday night AEDT) that the US carried out a \"large-scale strike against Venezuela\" and that President Nicolas Maduro and his wife had been captured, a stunning development that plunged the country into uncertainty after weeks of spiraling tensions.\"The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolás Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,\" he wrote on Truth Social.Venezuela requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council in response to the attack, Foreign Minister Yván Gil Pinto said.READ MORE: Why is the US attacking Venezuela?\"No cowardly attack will prevail against the strength of this people, who will emerge victorious,\" he said on Telegram, sharing the letter sent to the UN.Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez said in an audio call with state-run VTV that the government doesn&#x27;t know the whereabouts of Maduro and first lady Cilia Flores, demanding \"immediate proof of life\" from the Trump administration.Speaking to Fox News on Saturday morning, Trump said that Maduro and his wife are aboard the USS Iwo Jima heading to New York. Earlier, in an interview with The New York Times, he declined to answer questions about whether he had sought congressional authorisation for the strike, saying he would address the issue at a news conference.Here&#x27;s what we know.What has happened?A CNN team witnessed several explosions and heard the sounds of aircraft early Saturday in the Venezuelan capital Caracas, and reported that some areas of the city were without electricity.Videos verified by CNN showed helicopters roaring over Caracas, with plumes of smoke rising into the night sky. Footage also showed a large blaze and explosions at an airport in the city of Higuerote.Hours after the strikes, CNN&#x27;s Mary Mena said from Caracas that the capital was calm.\"We listened to many airplanes and helicopters passing by, but right now the city remains quiet, for the past two hours,\" she said. \"We haven&#x27;t heard people for example coming to the streets, and the state channel keeps repeating this message from the ministry of defense saying they want people to remain calm and they will deploy military forces across the country.\"READ MORE: US captures Venezuela&#x27;s president and wife, removes them from the country The first blast witnessed by the CNN team was recorded about 1.50am (5.50pm AEDT).\"One was so strong, my window was shaking after it,\" CNN correspondent Osmary Hernandez said.Several areas of the city were without power, and CNN journalists in the capital heard the sound of aircraft after the explosions.One video obtained and verified by CNN showed two plumes of smoke rising into the night sky amid city lights. An orange glow could be seen at the base of one of the plumes. Then a flash in another location was briefly seen, followed by a dull booming sound.Two sources familiar with the matter said that Maduro and his wife were dragged from their bedroom by US forces during the raid that led to their capture. The couple was captured in the middle of the night as they were sleeping, the sources said.The raid, carried out by the US Army&#x27;s elite Delta Force, did not lead to any US casualties, a US official said.Why is it happening?The Trump administration has for years said that Maduro was a criminal and has looked to prosecute him through the US legal system.In 2020, during Trump&#x27;s first term, Maduro was charged in the Southern District of New York for \"narco-terrorism\", conspiracy to import cocaine, and related charges.The Trump administration offered a $US15 million ($22 million) bounty for Maduro&#x27;s arrest. That bounty was increased to $US25 million ($37 million) in the waning days of the Biden administration, in early January 2025, and was increased again, to $US50 million ($74 million), in August 2025 after Trump took office for a second term and designated Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization. The administration has claimed that Maduro is the leader of that group, which it describes as a criminal organisation.Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee said Secretary of State Marco Rubio told him that Maduro was arrested to stand trial in the US.\"He informed me that Nicolás Maduro has been arrested by US personnel to stand trial on criminal charges in the United States, and that the kinetic action we saw tonight was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant,\" Lee posted on X early Saturday.In recent weeks, Trump had repeatedly warned that the US was preparing to take new action against alleged drug trafficking networks in Venezuela and that strikes on land will start \"soon\".Trump&#x27;s pressure campaign on Maduro has included strikes destroying more than 30 boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean in what the US has described as a counter-narcotics campaign. Trump last month ordered a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers coming to and leaving Venezuela.The CIA carried out a drone strike in December on a port facility on the coast of Venezuela, CNN reported last month, citing sources, marking the first known US attack on a target inside that country.How has the international community reacted?Several world leaders have reacted with concern to the US operation.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he \"wants to establish the facts\" and speak to Trump about the military operation in Venezuela, according to the UK&#x27;s PA Media news agency.\"I always say and believe we should all uphold international law,\" Starmer said, adding that Britain was \"not involved in any way\" in the strike on Caracas, PA Media reported.Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said in a post on X that the commission \"stand(s) by the people of Venezuela and support(s) a peaceful and democratic transition. Any solution must respect international law and the UN Charter.\"Meanwhile, Venezuela&#x27;s allies Russia and Iran condemned the US attack.The Russian foreign ministry denounced what it called an \"act of armed aggression against Venezuela\" by the US, calling any \"excuses\" given to justify such actions \"untenable\".\"We reaffirm our solidarity with the Venezuelan people and our support for the Bolivarian leadership&#x27;s course of action aimed at protecting the country&#x27;s national interests and sovereignty,\" a statement from the foreign ministry said. \"Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, interference from outside.\"Similarly, the Iranian foreign ministry said the attack violates Venezuela&#x27;s sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as the UN charter, Iranian state news outlet Press TV reported.What comes next?What happens next in Venezuela is far from clear. The country&#x27;s constitution states that power will pass to Maduro&#x27;s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez.But the future of the regime is in doubt, and the opposition – within and outside the country – will likely see this moment as a critical opportunity.Venezuela&#x27;s opposition says the rightful president is the exiled politician Edmundo Gonzalez.Amid the uncertainty, there are a range of scenarios.If the constitutional path – Article 233 – is followed, in the \"absolute absence\" of the president, the executive vice president – Delcy Rodriguez – takes over and calls for an election within 30 days. The newly elected president then serves a full six-year term.The regime collapses and its senior figures resign or flee, the most likely opposition candidate is Edmundo González Urrutia, who ran in the 2024 election. Gonzales, an academic and long-time diplomat, is now in exile in Spain. He is supported by the recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, democratic activist María Corina Machado. Speaking in Oslo last month after receiving the prize, Machado said her movement was preparing for \"an orderly and peaceful transition\" once Maduro was gone. She said in December that González had invited her to be vice-president and that \"the vast majority\" of the police and armed forces would follow the new administration&#x27;s orders once the political transition began.There could also be a military takeover. But the current defence minister, Vladimir Padrino López, has spoken out against the US strikes, saying Venezuela would resist the presence of foreign troops in the country. \"This invasion represents the greatest outrage the country has suffered,\" he said.",
