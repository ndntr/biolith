          "content": "Photographs appear to show former Prince Andrew on all fours leaning over a woman or girl lying on the floor, in the latest release of Epstein files from the US Department of Justice.In one undated image, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor looks directly at the camera as he crouches over the fully clothed figure, whose face has been obscured.Another photograph shows Mountbatten-Windsor&#x27;s hand placed on the same person&#x27;s abdomen.READ MORE: &#x27;Confusion, anxiety&#x27;: Expats from one country urged to check citizenship READ MORE: Barbecue explosion on NSW south coast leaves four people in hospital In the background, another unidentified person props their feet up on a table, which has a stack of towels on it.The latest Epstein documents also contain an email exchange between convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Mountbatten-Windsor in August 2010 in which the disgraced financier invites the royal to meet a \"friend\" for dinner in London.Mountbatten-Windsor replies he would be \"delighted to see her\" and tells Epstein to give her his contact details.Epstein then describes her as a 26-year-old Russian that is \"clevere (sic) beautiful, trustworthy,\" and confirms that she has Mountbatten-Windsor&#x27;s email.The messages are sent two years after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting sex with a minor.More than a month later, in another set of emails, Epstein and Mountbatten-Windsor make plans to meet in London.Mountbatten-Windsor suggests dinner at Buckingham Palace, where they would have \"lots of privacy\".Epstein writes that the pair will \"need/have private time\".It is unclear when or where the images were taken; no captions or context for the photographs were provided with the document release.Neither the photographs nor the email messages suggest any wrongdoing.CNN has attempted to contact Mountbatten-Windsor for comment.Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied all accusations against him and insisted that he never witnessed or suspected any of the behaviour of which Epstein was accused.In a now-infamous BBC interview in 2019, he said that he severed all ties with Epstein in 2010.UK Prime Minister calls on Andrew to testify in US British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called on the former prince to testify in US Congress over his links to Epstein following this latest document release.Starmer was asked during his visit to Japan whether he believed Andrew should give evidence on what he may know about Epstein&#x27;s crimes.\"Firstly, I have always approached this question with the victims of Epstein in mind. Epstein&#x27;s victims have to be the first priority,\" Starmer told reporters.\"As for whether there should be an apology, that&#x27;s a matter for Andrew.\"But yes, in terms of testifying, I have always said anybody who has got information should be prepared to share that information in whatever form they are asked to do that.\"You can&#x27;t be victim-centred if you&#x27;re not prepared to do that.\"READ MORE: Catherine O&#x27;Hara, star of Home Alone and Schitt&#x27;s Creek, dies aged 71 The Justice Department released its latest tranche of files related to the investigation into Epstein yesterday, six weeks after its Congressional deadline to do so.The new photographs and email exchanges are likely to cast additional scrutiny on Mountbatten-Windsor over Epstein links, which eventually led King Charles to strip his brother of his \"prince\" title and evict him from his Windsor mansion in an extraordinary move last year.Buckingham Palace did not offer a fresh statement when approached by CNN.Instead, it pointed to its October 2025 statement outlining King Charles&#x27; decision to remove Mountbatten-Windsor&#x27;s style, titles and honours.Last month, the DOJ released another cache of Epstein files, which underlined Mountbatten-Windsor&#x27;s relationship with not only Epstein but Epstein&#x27;s then-girlfriend, disgraced former British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.In one email, a person identified as only \"A\" wrote from the British royal family&#x27;s Scottish residence in 2001, asking whether Maxwell had \"found me some new inappropriate friends.\"A separate set of emails appears to show Maxwell helping plan a trip to Peru for \"A\" that involves \"girls.\"NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
