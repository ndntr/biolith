          "content": "The Coalition is back together after weeks-long split over the federal government&#x27;s hate speech laws. Opposition Leader Sussan Ley confirmed the party has reunited and Coalition arrangements have been restored – including the reinstatement of three Nationals senators who crossed the floor.\"Coalition is back together and looking to the future, not the past,\" Ley told media in Canberra.READ MORE: One dead, six hospitalised after falling ill at Sydney music event \"We&#x27;re squarely focused on representing the Australian people and fighting for their needs, their aspirations and their hopes.\"Ley acknowledged it had been a \"difficult time\" for Coalition supporters.She said a deal had been struck after she and Littleproud resolved their differences, but would not elaborate on what had changed. \"We are back in Coalition. We are stronger,\" Ley said.\"Differences have been resolved and we know that every single day we will be holding this... Anthony Albanese failing Labor government to account.\"And you can count on us every single day as a united team to work very, very hard for you.\" A joint party room meeting will take place on Tuesday.Nationals leader David Littleproud said it was disappointing to see bitter division among Coalition ranks but described the issue which sparked the division as \"substantive\". He said the split was not about personalities, but over \"principles\".\"It was over a substantive issue, a matter of principle that we weren&#x27;t both afforded the time to be able to explore in a proper way, that the Albanese government tried to rush through,\" Littleproud said.He said members of his party room had agonised over the hate speech bill so much that there were tears, which led to the Coalition&#x27;s 17-day split.Littleproud added that the Coalition would return stronger to ensure it does not happen again. \"The National Party believes that we are better together. Australia will be better with us being together,\" he said.\"This was a big decision for our party room.\"READ MORE: WA braces for Severe Tropical Cyclone Mitchell to make landfall Littleproud earlier told Today he has made it \"very clear\" he was open to reunification – but only if Ley dropped her demand of a six-month suspension from the shadow cabinet for the Nationals senators who split from the Liberals.\"The reality is, we made it very clear from the start that if our shadow ministers that crossed the floor were reinstated then the Coalition could come back together,\" the Nationals leader said.\"We&#x27;ve been very consistent all the way through.\" \"I hope that, in the near future, that there is a Coalition,\" he added.\"Because that&#x27;s the only way to bring Anthony Albanese down.\" The threat of Pauline Hanson&#x27;s One Nation has been looming large over the past week amid the bitter Coalition division.However, Littleproud said Hanson is not \"serious\" about becoming a genuine electoral opponent.\"She seems to be only coming after National and Liberal Party seats,\" he said.\"If the enemy is Anthony Albanese, as she articulates, she&#x27;s not really serious, is she?\"READ MORE: Grandmother killed after car crashed through bedroom as she slept Nine&#x27;s political editor Charles Croucher said the Nationals and Liberals needed to \"iron out\" details over reinstating the Nationals senators.\"The Nationals and Liberals, on the sidelines now, are back together to reshuffle around the parliament,\" Croucher said.\"Getting back together is a start, but it&#x27;s a long way back to any form of opposition for the Liberal and National parties.\"The entire Nationals frontbench, including Littleproud, quit in protest after three senators were dumped from the shadow ministry for voting against the government&#x27;s hate speech laws, despite the shadow cabinet agreeing to back the legislation. Bridget McKenzie, Ross Cadell and Susan McDonald broke ranks to vote against the hate speech bill in the Senate.NEVER MISS A STORY: Get your breaking news and exclusive stories first by following us across all platforms.Download the 9NEWS App here via Apple and Google PlayMake 9News your preferred source on Google by ticking this box hereSign up to our breaking newsletter here",
