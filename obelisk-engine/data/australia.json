LIVE UPDATES: Liberal leadership spill Footage shared widely online from the demonstrations showed officers interrupting a group praying as well as force being used to subdue the crowd. NSW Premier Chris Minns insisted it was \"proportionate\". \"I am not going to throw the police under a bus,\" Minns said.A video of officers moving on a group of muslim men in prayer attracted much outrage. Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said the move-on direction was not targeting any religion and \"apologised for any offence taken for interfering with that religious process\".The investigation will examine the lawfulness and appropriateness of the actions of NSW Police and individual officers.The LECC is the independent and specialist oversight body for the NSW Police Force.At the conclusion of the investigation, the LECC will release a public report to the NSW Parliament.
