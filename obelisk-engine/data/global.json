          "content": "Disney announced “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” will resume airing on Tuesday, ending Kimmel's short-lived suspension following comments the host made on his show about the killing of Charlie Kirk. In a statement released Monday, Disney said it suspended Kimmel last week “to avoid inflaming a tense situation.” The company received intense pressure from Trump allies, including Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, over Kimmel’s comments. “Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” Disney said in the statement. “It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.” “We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,” the statement continued. Kimmel’s suspension set off a wave of criticism from leaders in both parties who were concerned about political censorship. Prior to Kimmel’s suspension, Carr condemned Kimmel’s comments and suggested that media companies who receive licensing from the FCC have “an obligation to operate in the public interest.” “We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said last Wednesday in an interview. Hours later on Wednesday, Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcasting Group, two of the nation’s largest owners of local television stations, said they would preempt tapings of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” because of Kimmel’s comments. Nexstar Media Group is currently pursuing a billion-dollar merger with Tegna that would require FCC approval. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A handful of prominent Republicans on Capitol Hill, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, warned that Carr could set a dangerous precedent and urged the Trump administration to be careful in pressuring a private company to influence its speech. Democratic leaders in Washington and hundreds of artists and celebrities joined in condemning Kimmel’s suspension. FCC commissioner Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat in the agency's leadership, welcomed Kimmel's return to air and praised Americans who criticized the suspension. \"I am glad to see Disney find its courage in the face of clear government intimidation,\" she said. Andrew Kolvet, a spokesperson for Turning Point USA, encouraged Nexstar and Sinclair to keep their pledge to preempt Kimmel when his show returns. “Disney and ABC caving and allowing Kimmell back on the air is not surprising, but it's their mistake to make,” Kolvet said in a social media post Monday. “Nextstar and Sinclair do not have to make the same choice.”",
