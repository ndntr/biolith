The move represents a reversal for CEO Sam Altman, who in 2024 described advertising in ChatGPT as a \"last resort\" and expressed concerns that ads could erode user trust, although he did not completely rule out the possibility at the time. The banner ads will appear in the coming weeks for logged-in users of the free version of ChatGPT as well as the new $8 per month ChatGPT Go plan, which OpenAI also announced Friday is now available worldwide. OpenAI first launched ChatGPT Go in India in August 2025 and has since rolled it out to over 170 countries. Users paying for the more expensive Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise tiers will not see advertisements.Read full article Comments",
