Lagarde wants to leave before the French presidential election in April next year, which would allow French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz to find her replacement together, the report said, citing an unidentified person familiar with her thoughts on the matter. It isn’t clear yet when she may exit. UK inflation dropped to its lowest level since March 2025, bolstering the case for an interest rate cut when the Bank of England meets next month. Consumer prices rose 3% in January from a year earlier, down from 3.4% the previous month when volatile components temporarily boosted inflation, the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday. It was in line with economists’ expectations, and slightly above the 2.9% forecast by the BOE. (Source: Bloomberg)",
