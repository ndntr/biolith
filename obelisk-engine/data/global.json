          "standfirst": "Robert P. George said he and the foundation’s president were at an “impasse.”",
          "content": "Another member of the conservative Heritage Foundation has resigned following a video posted by the organization’s president defending Tucker Carlson’s interview with Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes. In a post to Facebook, board member Robert P. George said he can no longer remain part of the foundation without a “full retraction” of the video released last month by the organization’s president, Kevin Roberts. “Although Kevin publicly apologized for some of what he said in the video, he could not offer a full retraction of its content. So, we reached an impasse,” George said. Carlson’s interview with Fuentes — who has previously expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler — received widespread condemnation for antisemitism, and the aftermath has exposed fault lines among conservatives. In his Oct. 30 video, Roberts denounced the \"venomous coalition” criticizing both Fuentes and Carlson, adding that Carlson is a “close friend.” He said that though he disagrees with and even “abhors” things Fuentes said, he did not believe in “canceling” him or Carlson. On Sunday, President Donald Trump also defended Carlson, telling reporters “you can’t tell him who to interview.” Fuentes, a well-known provocateur on the right, has previously said that “organized Jewry” is leading to the disappearance of white culture. Roberts later said he “didn’t know much about this Fuentes guy,” and that his video script was written by an aide who has since resigned. George on Monday said that Roberts is a “good man” who acknowledged a “serious mistake.” “What divided us was a difference of opinion about what was required to rectify the mistake,” George added. A spokesman for the Heritage Foundation confirmed George's resignation in a statement to POLITICO, thanking him for his service and calling him a \"good man\" before defending Roberts. \"Under the leadership of Dr. Roberts, Heritage remains resolute in building an America where freedom, opportunity, prosperity, and civil society flourish. We are strong, growing, and more determined than ever to fight for our Republic,\" the spokesman said. George, the McCormick professor of jurisprudence and director of the James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions at Princeton University, had been a Heritage trustee since 2019, according to the foundation’s website. His resignation is one of several in light of Roberts' video, including at least five members of the foundation’s antisemitism task force, according to CBS News. “I pray that Heritage’s research and advocacy will be guided by the conviction that each and every member of the human family, irrespective of race, ethnicity, religion, or anything else, as a creature fashioned in the very image of God, is “created equal” and “endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights,” George said.",
