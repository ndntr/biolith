Hitzig, an economist and published poet who holds a junior fellowship at the Harvard Society of Fellows, spent two years at OpenAI helping shape how its AI models were built and priced. She wrote that OpenAI's advertising strategy risks repeating the same mistakes that Facebook made a decade ago. \"I once believed I could help the people building A.I. get ahead of the problems it would create,\" Hitzig wrote. \"This week confirmed my slow realization that OpenAI seems to have stopped asking the questions I'd joined to help answer.\" Hitzig did not call advertising itself immoral. Instead, she argued that the nature of the data at stake makes ChatGPT ads especially risky. Users have shared medical fears, relationship problems, and religious beliefs with the chatbot, she wrote, often \"because people believed they were talking to something that had no ulterior agenda.\" She called this accumulated record of personal disclosures \"an archive of human candor that has no precedent.\"Read full article Comments",
