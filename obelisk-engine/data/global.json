The claims, made by her sister in an affidavit, accuse her and two others of luring 17 South Africans to Russia under false pretences and sending them to the Donbas war zone without their consent. The case has been handed to a special police unit, and the presidency has said it was asked to help rescue the 17 men allegedly trapped in the region.
