          "content": "President Donald Trump discontinued former Vice President Kamala Harris’ Secret Service protection on Thursday, according to a memo reviewed by POLITICO. In a memo titled “Memorandum for the Secretary of Homeland Security,” and dated Aug. 28, Trump directed the Secret Service to revoke Harris’ security protections, effective Sept. 1. “You are hereby authorized to discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorized by Executive Memorandum, beyond those required by law, for the following individual effective September 1, 2025: Former Vice President Kamala D. Harris,” the memo read. The move, first disclosed by CNN, comes as Harris is set to embark on a 15-city tour to promote her new book, “107 Days,” starting next month. The tour will place the former vice president — who has remained largely out of the public eye since leaving office in January — back in the spotlight. “The Vice President is grateful to the United States Secret Service for their professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to safety,” Harris spokesperson Kirsten Allen said in a statement. Former President Joe Biden had initially extended Harris’ Secret Service protection — which had been set to last until only mid-July — for an additional year, according to a person familiar with the move who was granted anonymity to discuss security arrangements. While presidents receive lifelong protection after leaving office, coverage for vice presidents typically lasts only six months after they leave office. A White House spokesperson confirmed protection has been revoked but did not comment further. Trump similarly ended extended security protections for Hunter Biden and his half-sister Ashley Biden earlier this year.",
