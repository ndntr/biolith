          "content": "President Donald Trump announced late Monday he was launching a $15 billion lawsuit against The New York Times in his latest attack on a major media company over its reporting and commentary on him. The suit, filed in a Florida court, accuses the Times of being “a fullthroated mouthpiece of the Democrat Party” and cites a series of articles, including the paper’s front-page endorsement of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the lead-up to the 2024 election. Trump said in a post on Truth Social the “degenerate” Times had “engaged in a decades long method of lying about your Favorite President (ME!), my family, business, the America First Movement, MAGA, and our Nation as a whole.” “The New York Times has been allowed to freely lie, smear, and defame me for far too long, and that stops, NOW!” he added. Trump’s suit names The New York Times Company, four of the publication’s reporters — Susanne Craig, Russ Buettner, Peter Baker and Michael S. Schmidt — and Penguin Random House, which published a book titled “Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father’s Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success,” written by Craig and Buettner, that the legal filing calls “false, malicious, and defamatory.” The suit alleges the reporting had harmed Trump’s “unique brand” and business interests, including his media company’s stock value, causing “reputational injury” worth “billions of dollars.” Trump threatened only last week to sue the Times for reporting allegations he authored a sexually suggestive note in 2003 to disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who died by suicide in a New York jail cell in 2019. Trump has vigorously denied he wrote the note. The Republican leader has launched a flurry of lawsuits against publications and media companies he has accused of being unfriendly and defamatory, including The Wall Street Journal, ABC and Paramount, the parent of CBS News. In July, Paramount agreed to settle a $20 billion lawsuit filed by Trump over an interview with former Vice President Harris on CBS news program \"60 Minutes\" that the president said was deceptively edited, paying him $16 million.",

          "content": "Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah said on Monday that she was fired from the publication over social media posts she made following the killing of Charlie Kirk. Writing in a lengthy Substack post, Attiah said she was dismissed over her posts on Bluesky that she says were deemed to be \"unacceptable,” “gross misconduct” and that endangered the physical safety of her colleagues. “They rushed to fire me without even a conversation,” she wrote. “This was not only a hasty overreach, but a violation of the very standards of journalistic fairness and rigor the Post claims to uphold.” A spokesperson for the Washington Post declined to comment on personnel matters. The Washington Post's public social media policyrequires employees to ensure any posts made do not make \"reasonable people question their editorial independence, nor make reasonable people question The Post’s ability to cover issues fairly.\" The guidance also urges staffers to \"avoid curating your feeds in ways that suggest you have a partisan point of view on an issue The Post covers,\" though the policy specifically states that does not apply to columnists, critics and other practitioners of opinion journalism posting as part of their work. Earlier this year, the publication shifted its opinion section to focus on supporting “personal liberties and free markets.” Owner Jeff Bezos said at the time that a “broad-based opinion section” was no longer needed because a diversity of opinions were available online. In a statement, the Washington Post guild called Attiah's firing \"unjust\" and said it would continue to defend her rights. \"The Post not only flagrantly disregarded standard disciplinary processes, it also undermined its own mandate to be a champion of free speech,\" the guild said in a post on X. \"The right to speak freely is the ultimate personal liberty and the foundation of Karen’s 11-year career at The Post.\" Some of Attiah’s social media posts condemned political violence but also highlighted Kirk’s divisive comments on Black women. In her only post directly mentioning Kirk, she quoted the Turning Point USA founder’s comments that Black women lack “brain processing power.” “I made clear that not performing over-the-top grief for white men who espouse violence was not the same as endorsing violence against them,” Attiah said. Attiah, who started her career at The Washington Post in 2014, said the publication “silenced\" her. She warned her firing is part of a larger trend. “What happened to me is part of a broader purge of Black voices from academia, business, government, and media — a historical pattern as dangerous as it is shameful — and tragic,” she said.",
