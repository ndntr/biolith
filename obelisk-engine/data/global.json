The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said previously that two detainees had been killed and one injured, but issued a corrected statement. The Dallas police chief, Daniel Comeaux, said that the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence. The shooter died from a “self-inflicted gun wound”, according to the secretary of the DHS, Kristi Noem.The DHS said no members of law enforcement were hurt in the attack. But Comeaux also said that officials would not be releasing the identities of any victims at this time.DHS officials say this was “an attack on Ice law enforcement”. At both today’s press conference and in a statement, law enforcement said that shell casings found near the shooter had “anti-Ice” messaging on them.The shooter has been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn, according to NBC News – which cited several senior law enforcement officials.Dallas police said that shots were fired “from an adjacent building”. The DHS later added that the shooter “fired indiscriminately” at the Ice facility, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot”. All three victims were inside the van at the time the gunman opened fire.The Dallas field office where the shooting occurred is used for short-term processing of people in custody. The victims may have been recently arrested by Ice. The facility is along Interstate 35 East, south-west of a large commercial airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and just blocks from hotels catering to airport travelers.Despite the fact that no federal agents were wounded in the shooting, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, called the attack an “assassination”. For her part, Noem said that “these horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far left that their rhetoric about Ice has consequences”. Donald Trump instantly politicized the shooting, claiming in a social media post that it “is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to ‘Nazis.’”The vice-president, JD Vance, claimed without evidence that the shooting was carried out by “a violent leftwing extremist” who was “politically motivated to go after law enforcement”. While the FBI has said that authorities recovered shell casings with “anti-Ice messaging” near the shooter, officials have neither confirmed a motive nor corroborated Vance’s claims about the shooter’s ideological background.

          "content": "Nexstar Media Group will continue to preempt “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” on its ABC affiliates, the company said Tuesday, effectively pulling the late-night show from dozens of local stations as the comedian prepares to make his return to the airwaves. The company noted it would “monitor” the show as it returns to ABC, but said its stations would “focus on continuing to produce local news and other programming relevant to their respective markets.” The move makes Nexstar the second broadcasting company to preempt the show, following suit after the Sinclair Broadcasting Group announced Monday it would not air the talk program on its nearly 40 ABC affiliates. “We made a decision last week to preempt ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’ following what ABC referred to as Mr. Kimmel’s ‘ill-timed and insensitive’ comments at a critical time in our national discourse,” the company wrote in a statement Tuesday. “We stand by that decision pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve.” Nexstar, the country’s largest local broadcasting group, owns roughly 30 ABC affiliates across cities like Nashville, Tenn., New Orleans and Salt Lake City. Sinclair also owns dozens of affiliates, including the ABC station serving Washington and its suburbs. ABC parent Disney announced Monday it would resume airing “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” after deciding to suspend the show last week to “avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country.” The show’s suspension sparked a flood of criticism from lawmakers and party leaders across the aisle, citing concerns about censorship — particularly after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr threatened to look into affiliates because of the comedian’s comments. Nexstar is currently seeking a merger with Tegna, which requires FCC approval. “We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,” Disney's statement on Monday read.",
