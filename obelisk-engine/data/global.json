OpenAI also launched a new iOS social app that allows users to insert themselves into AI-generated videos through what OpenAI calls \"cameos.\" OpenAI showcased the new model in an AI-generated video that features a photorealistic version of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman talking to the camera in a slightly unnatural-sounding voice amid fantastical backdrops, like a competitive ride-on duck race and a glowing mushroom garden. Regarding that voice, the new model can create what OpenAI calls \"sophisticated background soundscapes, speech, and sound effects with a high degree of realism.\" In May, Google's Veo 3 became the first video-synthesis model from a major AI lab to generate synchronized audio as well as video. Just a few days ago, Alibaba released Wan 2.5, an open-weights video model that can generate audio as well. Now OpenAI has joined the audio party with Sora 2.Read full article Comments",
