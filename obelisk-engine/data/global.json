While these same companies previously scraped Wikipedia without permission, the deals mean that most major AI developers have now signed on to the foundation's Wikimedia Enterprise program, a commercial subsidiary that sells API access to Wikipedia's 65 million articles at higher speeds and volumes than the free public APIs provide. The foundation did not disclose the financial terms of the deals. The new partners join Google, which signed a deal with Wikimedia Enterprise in 2022, as well as smaller companies like Ecosia, Nomic, Pleias, ProRata, and Reef Media. The revenue helps offset infrastructure costs for the nonprofit, which otherwise relies on small public donations while watching its content become a staple of training data for AI models.Read full article Comments",
