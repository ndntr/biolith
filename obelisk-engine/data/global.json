          "standfirst": "The demonstrations follow a wave of protests in June that organizers say drew more than 5 million people in cities across the country.",
          "content": "The nationwide “No Kings” protest movement is back for round two — and after avoiding Washington during the summer, protesters descended on the nation’s capital Saturday amid an 18-day government shutdown that has no end in sight. The demonstrations are part of the second national day of action, organized by dozens of liberal advocacy groups to protest what they call “authoritarian power grabs” on the part of President Donald Trump. Organizers said they expected the more than 2,600 events across all 50 states to surpass the more than 5 million people who attended the first wave of “No Kings” rallies in June. The marches come amid heightened criticism from Republicans about this weekend’s rallies. “They might try to paint this weekend's events as something dangerous to our society, but the reality is there is nothing unlawful or unsafe about organizing and attending peaceful protests,” said Deirdre Schifeling of the American Civil Liberties Union. “It's the most patriotic and American thing you can do, and we have a 250-year-old history of disagreeing in public.” Amid the heightened tensions of the shutdown, Republicans have repeatedly sought to vilify the planned protests. House Speaker Mike Johnson and other leading Republicans have referred to the protests as a “hate America rally” and sought to tie it to Hamas and antifa. And Texas Gov. Greg Abbott also announced Thursday that he would be sending members of the state’s National Guard — as well as state troopers, Texas Rangers and Department of Public Safety personnel — to Austin on Saturday in response to the planned demonstrations. In an interview with Fox News earlier this week, Trump said “some people say [Democrats] want to delay” ending the government shutdown because of the rallies. “They're referring to me as a king. I'm not a king,” Trump said in the interview. But on Saturday morning, shortly before the Washington rally was set to kick off, the Trump War Room account posted an image of a smirking Trump wearing a crown. Organizers and Democratic politicians remain undeterred by the response, though. Rep. Pat Ryan (D-N.Y.), who was set to appear at rallies in his district, said Democrats were intentionally trying to paint Saturday's rallies in fundamentally patriotic terms in response to Republicans' attacks. \"We knew they’d try to do what they’re now doing,\" he told POLITICO Playbook. \"So we thought it was really important to make clear that there’s literally nothing more patriotic and more American than exercising your First Amendment rights when you disagree with the direction of your country.” Ryan said he and other members of Congress with a background in the military and national security now talk regularly to chart a response as “Trump has ratcheted up the politicization of the military.” Leah Greenberg, progressive advocacy organization Indivisible co-executive director, called it “part of a broader effort to create a permission structure to crack down\" on peaceful protests. “They are panicking and they are flailing and they are searching for anything — literally anything — to distract from their own governing failures,” Greenberg said of Republicans at a press conference. “And in their desperation, they have decided to go with smearing millions of Americans who are coming out to peacefully, joyfully assert our rights.” The first wave of rallies that took place on June 14 — the same day as Trump’s military parade in Washington, which coincided with the army’s 250th anniversary and Trump’s 79th birthday — were overwhelmingly peaceful, and organizers said then that they intentionally avoided a counterprotest in Washington to avoid the military parade. The events went off almost entirely without incident, save for one notable exception of volunteer rally “peacekeepers” shooting and killing a bystander at a Utah march because they believed another man with a gun was about to fire on the crowd. Republicans’ efforts to demonize the rally comes amid a White House push to target left-leaning nonprofits perceived as hostile to the administration’s agenda. At an early rally, about 150 people have gathered at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, to protest the dismissal of thousands of federal employees. “People are hurting and some people are dying because of the actions of President Trump,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who pointed toward the Trump administration’s disruption of clinical cancer trials. “Part of having a healthy America is making sure we protect our democracy and our rights. That is a healthy America.” As NIH employees who were speaking urged crowd members to sign petitions to protect university research, protesters raised their signs in agreement: “Enough is enough,” they shouted back. Unlike the June protests, the Saturday slate of events also included a rally in front of the U.S. Capitol in Washington. Organizers said Saturday that over 200,000 people participated in D.C. When asked for comment ahead of Saturday’s rallies, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson responded: “Who cares?” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), one of the first speakers at the demonstration in Washington, earlier this week criticized the push as an effort to “suppress turnout.” “They’re showing us how much they hate free speech,” he said in a Wednesday social media video. “The rhetoric has ramped up from Republican leaders in the last few days.” The speaker list in D.C. also included Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Karen Attiah, a former Washington Post columnist who was fired last month after attracting criticism for several social media posts in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s murder. Several of the speakers at the Washington rally focused their remarks on the Trump administration's attempts to ramp up immigration enforcement and deploy military troops into American cities. Sanders capped off the rally with an impassioned address about the series of dangers he said Trump posed to democracy, decrying the president's attacks on the media and higher education and his attempts to prosecute his political enemies. The senator also lambasted Republicans for supporting Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" which could contribute to more than 10 million people losing health care coverage, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. \"When he was sworn in as the nation's first president, George Washington called this attempt at self-government 'an experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.' My fellow Americans, in an unprecedented way, that experiment is now in danger,\" Sanders said. Ben Johansen contributed to this report.",

          "content": "NEW YORK — The Vermont state senator involved in the hate-filled Young Republican group chat uncovered by POLITICO announced his resignation Friday. Sam Douglass, a state lawmaker who represented an area near the Canadian border, said in a statement that “if my Governor asks me to do something, I will act, because I believe in what he’s trying to do,” referring to Vermont Republican Governor Phil Scott’s call for Douglass to step down. Douglass was the only elected official in the group chat, though four others worked for elected officials at the time the messages were being sent. Those officials include New York’s state senate minority leader and the Kansas attorney general. One member of the chat worked in President Donald Trump’s Small Business Administration. “I know that this decision will upset many, and delight others, but in this political climate I must keep my family safe,” Douglass said, adding that his resignation will be effective Monday at noon. “Since the story broke, I have reached out to the majority of my Jewish and BIPOC friends and colleagues to ensure that they can be honest and upfront with me, and I know that as a young person I have a duty to set a good example for others.” His lengthy statement also cites hateful messages he received from others in his state since the story broke. Douglass’ resignation comes as at least six others in the chat are out of jobs since POLITICO began reporting on the exchanges. He served as the chair of Vermont’s Young Republicans organization. In one portion of the chat, Douglass refers to an Indian woman as someone who “just didn’t bathe often.” In another instance, Brianna Douglass, Sam’s wife and the Vermont Young Republican’s national committee member, says her husband may have erred by “expecting the Jew to be honest.” The Vermont state lawmaker initially resisted strident calls to resign from top state Republican leaders — including Scott and the GOP conferences in the state’s House and Senate. One day after POLITICO published its initial story about the Telegram group, Douglass apologized for the chat, saying “I am weighing all my options.” Douglass was a first-year lawmaker and said Friday he was proud to pass his first bill on agriculture and begin his work to reform the state’s welfare system. “I will continue to do what I have done my entire life, the very reasons why I was elected; I will help others in my community, be active, foster communication, and look out for others,” he said.

          "title": "Five takeaways from the New York City mayoral debate",
          "standfirst": "Zohran Mamdani dominated the evening, while Andrew Cuomo couldn’t induce any major mistakes.",
          "content": "Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani smiled his way through a two-hour debate where Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa tried to land punches on the front-runner. Few of those hits had much of an impact against Mamdani, who effectively pressed his affordability platform without making any significant mistakes. Cuomo needed a moment that he didn’t get. Mamdani had a largely pain-free night. Here are five takeaways from the first of two general election debates: Mamdani was smooth The young assemblymember reminded debate viewers why a 33-year-old democratic socialist is on the cusp of becoming mayor of New York City — he’s a great communicator. With a double-digit lead in every poll, all Mamdani really needed was not to collapse. He succeeded — and avoided any major missteps. Some Republicans seized on his awkward moment declining to endorse Gov. Kathy Hochul’s reelection, even though she took a big political risk by backing his candidacy… but that’s not exactly going to cost Mamdani the race. At times, he might have been too smooth — he’s practiced lines on topics like affordability and Israel so many times you can almost see him going into autopilot.Clinical Cuomo struggled Cuomo needed a breakout moment against Mamdani. He’s stuck in second place in polls, and even with Mayor Eric Adams suspending his campaign, the ex-governor has not been able to surpass the front-running Democratic nominee. The debate underscored the key problem facing Cuomo who’s running as an independent after losing in an upset to Mamdani in June. In his long career, Cuomo has never successfully run a campaign as the underdog. His sole electoral loss came 23 years ago against Carl McCall. Every election since, Cuomo was the clear favorite. Cuomo spoke from the podium with a dry recitation of facts. Mamdani appeared well prepared for the ex-governor’s attacks, many of which — like the Queens assemblymember’s past criticism of Barack Obama — were recycled from the primary campaign. That criticism didn’t work then, and it isn’t clear why Cuomo would think it could work now in a general election. Curtis talked up Trump One of the quirks of this race is the candidate with the deepest experience with President Donald Trump is Cuomo, who has known him for decades. Mamdani has never met the president. Sliwa, the Republican nominee, has the most strained relationship. Trump has scoffed at his party’s candidate to lead his hometown as not ready for primetime. The president derisively noted that Sliwa lives with a lot of cats in a small apartment. Yet it was Sliwa who pledged to have a working relationship with the president, who has tried to exert his will over this deep blue city. The Guardian Angels founder said it wouldn’t be productive to work against Trump or try to be a tough guy with the president. This stance serves multiple purposes. Cuomo is trying to steal Sliwa’s Republican supporters, and Sliwa needs MAGA New Yorkers to stay in the fold. Sliwa also likely knows Cuomo and Mamdani won’t go out on a similar limb since they can’t afford to lose Democratic voters who loathe Trump. When you’re explaining… The former governor spent much of the evening explaining. And explaining. And explaining some more. Cuomo had to parry attacks on his decade-long record as the state’s chief executive when it came to funding for homeless people and mental health programs. He repeatedly pushed back when Mamdani or Sliwa referenced the sexual harassment scandal that drove him from office, once again denying any wrongdoing. Those digressions cost him precious time to prosecute the case against Mamdani.Mamdani’s clear weaknesses The otherwise strong night by Mamdani had the effect of highlighting his weaknesses on public safety and Israel. He struggled when talking about his plans for making changes to the Civilian Complaint Review Board — almost sounding like a Wikipedia entry when describing the panel’s job of assessing police misconduct. Mamdani was also on his backfoot when being attacked by Cuomo over embracing the phrase “globalize the intifada.” As strong as Mamdani can be on affordability and cost-of-living concerns that are so important to New Yorkers, he still has vulnerabilities on other issues where Cuomo is strongest.",
