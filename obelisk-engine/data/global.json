          "standfirst": "The Republican pressed Spanberger on a 2022 text message sent by the Democratic candidate for Virginia attorney general.",
          "content": "Democrat Abigail Spanberger passed on a chance to use one of the most high-profile moments of her run for Virginia governor to withdraw her endorsement for her party’s attorney general nominee for his use of violent rhetoric in a text message. The subject of Jay Jones’ violent message from three years ago emerged immediately as the Democrat faced Republican Winsome Earle-Sears on Thursday in the only planned debate of the closely watched race. Spanberger condemned the text as “abhorrent” but repeatedly declined to say whether she would withdraw her support for Jones, saying it should be left to the voters in the Nov. 4 election. “The voters now have the information, and it is up to voters to make an individual choice based on this information,” she said. Jones suggested the former Republican House speaker should get “two bullets to the head.” He has apologized for the text, which became public last week amid rising fears of political violence following a string of incidents, including the killing of Charlie Kirk on Sept. 10 and the attack on Minnesota lawmakers in June. Jones' text dominated the early portion of the debate at Norfolk State University that otherwise include feisty exchanges on public policy and culture war issues. Earle-Sears pivoted from the first question, about Virginia’s car tax, to insist that Spanberger address the issue. “My opponent needs to answer about Jay Jones.” The lieutenant governor then repeatedly turned to ask Spanberger what it would take for her to call for Jones to leave the race. “You have little girls,” she said, looking directly at her opponent and ignoring moderators’ attempts to allow the Democratic nominee to answer. “What would it take? Him pulling the trigger? Is that what would do it and then you would say he needs to get out of the race, Abigail?” While Spanberger declined to say whether she would continue to support Jones, she made it clear she disagreed with his text. \"I denounced them when I learned of them and I will denounce them at every opportunity,\" she said. The debate frequently bogged down with cross-talk and by Earle-Sears' interruptions of her opponent. Their differences centered around whose party deserves blame for the government shutdown, immigration enforcement, abortion rights and gay marriage — which the lieutenant governor opposes. Virginia is one of two states electing governors in November and is often viewed as a bellwether election for the party occupying the White House. Democrats were hoping for decisive wins in Virginia to use as a springboard into next year’s midterms, but have encountered some turbulence as Republicans have announced a combined $3 million ad push in recent days to keep the text messaging saga top of mind for voters in the campaign’s final stretch. President Donald Trump looms large in the Virginia gubernatorial contest. He’s not only unpopular with Democrats and Independents, his administration’s gutting of the federal government through DOGE cuts and his push to deny backpay to federal workers still on the payroll but forced off the job during the partial federal government shutdown disproportionately impact Virginia voters. There was little talk about the history at stake during the hour-long debate. Either would be the first female governor of Virginia and Earle-Sears would be the first Black woman to lead the state.",

          "content": "Discord says that hackers made off with images of 70,000 users’ government IDs that they were required to provide in order to use the site. Like an increasing number of sites, Discord requires certain users to provide a photo or scan of their driver's license or other government ID that shows they meet the minimum age requirements in their country. In some cases, Discord allows users to prove their age by providing a selfie that shows their faces (it’s not clear how a face proves someone’s age, but there you go). The social media site imposes these requirements on users who are reported by other users to be under the minimum age for the country they’re connecting from. “A substantial risk for identity theft” On Wednesday, Discord said that ID images of roughly 70,000 users “may have had government-ID photos exposed” in a recent breach of a third-party service Discord entrusted to manage the data. The affected users had communicated with Discord’s Customer Support or Trust & Safety teams and subsequently submitted the IDs in reviews of age-related appeals.Read full article Comments",
