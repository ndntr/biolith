            "standfirst": "Generative AI is being pushed into healthcare – and diagnostic risks may deepen the class divideIn southern California, where rates of homelessness are among the highest in the nation, a private company, Akido Labs, is running clinics for unhoused patients and others with low incomes. The caveat? The patients are seen by medical assistants who use artificial intelligence (AI) to listen to the conversations, then spit out potential diagnoses and treatment plans, which are then reviewed by a doctor. The company’s goal, its chief technology officer told the MIT Technology Review, is to “pull the doctor out of the visit”.This is dangerous. Yet it’s part of a larger trend where generative AI is being pushed into healthcare for medical professionals. In 2025, a survey by the American Medical Association reported that two out of three physicians used AI to assist with their daily work, including diagnosing patients. One AI startup raised $200m to provide medical professionals with an app dubbed “ChatGPT for doctors”. US lawmakers are considering a bill that would recognize AI as able to prescribe medication. While this trend of AI in healthcare affects almost all patients, it has a deeper impact on people with low incomes who already face substantial barriers to care and higher rates of mistreatment in healthcare settings.

            "content": "Generative AI is being pushed into healthcare – and diagnostic risks may deepen the class divideIn southern California, where rates of homelessness are among the highest in the nation, a private company, Akido Labs, is running clinics for unhoused patients and others with low incomes. The caveat? The patients are seen by medical assistants who use artificial intelligence (AI) to listen to the conversations, then spit out potential diagnoses and treatment plans, which are then reviewed by a doctor. The company’s goal, its chief technology officer told the MIT Technology Review, is to “pull the doctor out of the visit”.This is dangerous. Yet it’s part of a larger trend where generative AI is being pushed into healthcare for medical professionals. In 2025, a survey by the American Medical Association reported that two out of three physicians used AI to assist with their daily work, including diagnosing patients.

Here’s what the science saysEver since Keith, 39, from Kansas, was in a car accident in 2023, he has lived with “pretty much constant mid-back and shoulder pain”. Over-the-counter treatments didn’t touch the sides and he didn’t want to resort to opiates. “Having exhausted everything there was solid science for with no satisfaction, I delved into acupressure,” he says. He bought an acupressure mat made of lightly padded fabric, studded all over with tiny plastic spikes, to lay his back on, and was surprised to find that it actually helped.Acupressure mats, also known as Shakti mats, are inspired by the beds of nails that Indian gurus used for meditation and healing more than 1,000 years ago. While today’s mats have the nonthreatening sheen of a luxury wellbeing product, the spikes are no joke. In fact, the internet serves up a plethora of images of flaming, dented backs after their use – although you’re unlikely to seriously injure yourself using them. While the mats have been widely available for more than a decade, there has been a recent surge in mainstream interest. You may have seen them heavily advertised on your social media feed, the most prominent brand being Shakti Mat, made in India and costing up to £99 for the premium model. But Amazon is full of acupressure mats and pillows – Lidl recently stocked a mat and pillow combo for a tenner. Yet there is still no compelling evidence that they relieve stress, pain and sleep problems, or help with any other unmet health needs. Continue reading...",
