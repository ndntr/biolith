Many expected it to play a huge part in the awards conversation, with key scenes surely destined to be shown in sizzle reel clips at endless prize ceremonies and invoked in endless op-ed pieces about fragile masculinity. But no. Now it is almost a modern film maudit, all but forgotten, a cursed film only now coming out quietly, and maybe its star is maudit as well.Majors plays Killian Maddox, an iron-pumping wannabe caring for his disabled grandfather and cultivating a fan obsession with the stars of the bodybuilding circuit. He is particularly keen on a preening beefcake named Brad Vanderhorn, whose magazine covers Killian plasters over the walls of his sad bedroom, and dreams of making it on to these covers himself. Killian is plagued with loneliness, depression and incipient mental illness, body dysmorphia and inability to connect with women. At one point he has a full-tilt, Travis Bickle-style disastrous date with Jessie (Haley Bennett), a co-worker at the supermarket where he has a day-job. And he is addicted to steroids, which trigger terrifying ’roid rage. Continue reading...",
