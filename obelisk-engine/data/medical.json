The latest film from multi-hyphenate artist Lynette Wallworth – whose eclectic oeuvre includes documentaries, video installations and virtual-reality productions – attempts a difficult task: linking the reality of death to the idea of new possibilities, maybe even new beginnings. Not in terms of an afterlife: the core idea is more about how improving the process of dying might also improve how we live.Edge of Life explores the medical use of psychedelics in palliative care – particularly psilocybin, a psychoactive compound found in magic mushrooms. Research into psychedelics in psychology and psychiatry has surged in recent years, and the film highlights one small part of this: an Australian-first clinical trial conducted at Melbourne’s St Vincent’s hospital by Dr Justin Dwyer and Dr Margaret Ross, who feature prominently.

The Covid vaccines were produced faster than any previous effort, and are credited with saving millions of lives from 2021 onwards.

According to a recent study published in Nature, mRNA vaccines seem to trigger a powerful immune response that increases the median survival time by about 75% for certain cancer patients.
