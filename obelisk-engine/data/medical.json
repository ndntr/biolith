Unless she’s just making that part up – it’s hard to tell what’s true or false given her murky memory.On a dark and stormy night, Pedro arrives at the insistence of his ex Laura (Agustina Liendo) to check on Alicia in the decrepit mansion where she lives alone. Laura is on a road trip with her young daughter (Emma Cetrángolo), but she’s sensed that something’s up, especially since when she called Alicia’s carer, Alicia herself answered the phone. Pedro’s unfortunate resemblance to Cesar gets him lashed to an armchair in chains and duct tape while Alicia quizzes him on their history, with gory results. Continue reading...",

Now 80 years old, still spry as a whippet and clearly up for movie mischief, Maura gives Alicia a dirty glint in her eye as she confuses her daughter’s ex-boyfriend Pedro (Daniel Hendler, showing great comic chops) with her late husband Cesar. He apparently turned Alicia on to some BDSM fun and games in their youth, and may have assisted Alicia in covering up a murder or two. Unless she’s just making that part up – it’s hard to tell what’s true or false given her murky memory.On a dark and stormy night, Pedro arrives at the insistence of his ex Laura (Agustina Liendo) to check on Alicia in the decrepit mansion where she lives alone. Laura is on a road trip with her young daughter (Emma Cetrángolo), but she’s sensed that something’s up, especially since when she called Alicia’s carer, Alicia herself answered the phone. Pedro’s unfortunate resemblance to Cesar gets him lashed to an armchair in chains and duct tape while Alicia quizzes him on their history, with gory results. Continue reading...",
