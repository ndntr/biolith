Her mother died giving birth to her, and in the eyes of some villagers, that meant the baby was cursed. According to tradition, there was only one way to deal with such a child. The villagers tied the newborn to her mother’s lifeless body and prepared to bury them together.When word reached a Nigerian missionary living in the community, she rushed to the burial site and pleaded for the baby’s life.
