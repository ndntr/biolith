The night before, I’d been at an old friend’s 60th birthday, crammed into the function room of a pub somewhere in Surrey.

By the way, how come some people have nose-blows like trumpets, and others don’t? A question for another day.At mention of my night out, this trio of troubadours in the TV green room did two things. First, they shrunk away from me slightly. Second, they engaged in a feverishly enthusiastic discussion on how to avoid catching colds which, naturally enough given their line of work, was something of an obsession for them. I get that, but I have skin in this game too – I must avoid colds at all costs because the colds I get are worse than anyone else’s. I don’t have a medical certificate to confirm this, but I know it to be true. My colds last longer.
