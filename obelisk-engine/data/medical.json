He says that after 40, humans typically lose about a centimetre of height every decade. Men lose 0.08-0.1% of their body height per year. Women typically lose 0.12-0.14% per year.Some of this is caused by increasingly slumped posture as we get older. People who sit or stand with a curved spine for prolonged periods of time – perhaps at their desk – may find that, over time, their spine assumes that position naturally. Older people sometimes stoop to find a more secure centre of gravity too. Continue reading...",
