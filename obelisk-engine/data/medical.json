Inside is her stash of vodka, which she carefully siphons into mineral water bottles for the next day. There is no pleasure in her drinking; it makes her foggy at work and detached from her boys. Bonneton, better known in France for comedy roles, is terrific, with her warm, worn performance, not a scrap of sentimentality in it.Suzanne hits her rock bottom after a car accident; the court puts her sons into the care of their grandparents and orders her into rehab. First comes denial. “Some wine with dinner,” she tells the doctor who asks her about her drinking at the all-female unit. Other residents include Diane (Michèle Laroque), a famous actor who haughtily lords it over the other women, and twentysomething Alice (Sabrina Ouazani), who describes herself as a party girl but whose stories, when she shares them in group, sound more self-destructive than fun.
