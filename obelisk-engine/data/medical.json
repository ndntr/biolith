Flushing out blood clots from a newborn’s brain to prevent damage was just one technique evolved by the pioneering neonatologist, who has died aged 79. Among his other innovations was temporarily cooling oxygen-deprived newborns to prevent brain damage.In the 1970s, when Whitelaw began his career, he said the human brain was largely a mysterious “black box”. But improvements in scanning technology made it possible to discover (and therefore treat) conditions in babies that would otherwise have only been found at autopsy, after the baby had died.

Here’s what we learned about living well this yearThe best advice for living a healthy, well-adjusted life – eat your vegetables, get a good night’s sleep, politely decline when the Jägerbombs appear – never really changes. Other nuggets, such as how much protein you should be eating or how to maximise workouts, seem to change every year. But as we wonder whether we should really give sauerkraut another go, science marches on, making tiny strides towards improving our understanding of what’s helpful. Here’s what you might have missed in the research this year, from the best reason to eat beetroot, to how to ruin your five-a-side performance before the game even starts. There’s still time to break out the pickle juice shots before 2026 … Continue reading...",
