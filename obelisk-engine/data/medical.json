Freedom of information requests by the Guardian have uncovered a sharp increase in the number of reported attacks in hospitals, with an average of 285 each day in 2024-25. Some of the details shared with our reporters were horrifying. One A&E nurse said that she sees weapons brandished on a monthly basis, and described two incidents in which male patients deliberately ejaculated on nurses while waiting for treatment.

Because the UK’s health workforce is so diverse, and interacts constantly with the public, its members are highly exposed to rising anti-migrant sentiment. In November the health secretary, Wes Streeting, expressed shock at the impact on the NHS of resurgent “1970s-, 1980s-style racism”.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Freedom of information requests by the Guardian have uncovered a sharp increase in the number of reported attacks in hospitals, with an average of 285 each day in 2024-25. Some of the details shared with our reporters were horrifying. One A&E nurse said that she sees weapons brandished on a monthly basis, and described two incidents in which male patients deliberately ejaculated on nurses while waiting for treatment. A consultant – now retired – said that he had been violently assaulted twice within a period of weeks.The increase in racist incidents is also gravely concerning. Because the UK’s health workforce is so diverse, and interacts constantly with the public, its members are highly exposed to rising anti-migrant sentiment. In November the health secretary, Wes Streeting, expressed shock at the impact on the NHS of resurgent “1970s-, 1980s-style racism”.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Certainly in this country it is now possible to go for a walk in the countryside or in towns without having to watch your step.However, quite often a footpath or bridleway is made impassable due to large dumps of horse manure. Dog owners have taken on their duty to clear up after their pets, always armed with dog-poo bags. Why are horse owners and riders allowed to make much larger, smellier and long-lasting heaps of horse excrement? I can imagine that it would be inconvenient for a horse rider to dismount so as to clear up the poo, but I don’t see why the riding stables should not have this duty.
