The possibility of blood- or sex-based transmission combined with its first emergence among marginalised and criminalised populations created a potent mix of primal terror and terrifying prejudice.It can sometimes be difficult to remember just how potently misinformation, fear and outright hostility framed the knowledge and experience of Aids in the first decade or so of the pandemic. In this period, a positive result on an HIV test was a terminal diagnosis and medical knowledge about transmission and treatment was still cloudy.Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Continue reading...",

Yes, eating UPFs made from animal products (like chicken nuggets and cheese in a squeeze bottle) can increase the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and certain cancers, but UPFs from plants (like cereal, canned beans and even veggie burgers) can actually help keep you healthy.More and more leading health organisations agree that a more nuanced approach to UPFs is necessary. The American Medical Association recently passed a resolution that “supports and promotes public awareness and education about the differences between healthful foods and unhealthful ultra-processed foods”. The American Heart Association also recently released a report noting that “not all UPFs are junk foods or have poor nutritional quality; some UPFs have better nutritional value [than others] and can be part of an overall healthy dietary pattern”. This difference has a lot to do with whether the UPF is an animal- or plant-based product. Continue reading...",
