But it is not confined to GP referrals. Hospital patients are constantly in a similar position.

Sometimes this follows an appointment being cancelled, with a “we will be in contact soon” message that turns out not to be true.

My experience is shared by large numbers of patients.The administrators are, in my experience, competent and dedicated people – but the system is not working. The commonly heard complaint that “there’s too much bureaucracy in the NHS” is wrong. What is needed is a well-managed administrative system, where the chief priority is that somebody is responsible for ensuring coordination, and that gaps are filled, eg when an administrator is on leave, ill, or moves to a different job. The present dire situation also means that nurses and doctors have to add administrative tasks to their already-heavy workload, adding to their stress and burnout. Continue reading...",
