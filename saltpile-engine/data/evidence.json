      "abstract": "Certain antidiabetic agents may prevent dementia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The purpose of this study is to elucidate the relative effect of antidiabetic agents on reducing dementia risk in patients with T2DM. PubMed, Cochrane Library and Igaku Chuo Zasshi-Web from inception to 31 December 2023 were searched. Trials reported in English or Japanese language that assessed the effects of glucose-lowering drugs on dementia were selected. Overall, 67 trials (4 088 683 individuals) assessing nine antidiabetic agent classes were included. Studies comprised monotherapies versus control (no use of antidiabetic agents or placebo) (three trials), monotherapies versus add-on therapies (one trial) and real-world database studies (63 trials). The analysis showed that the risk of dementia decreased with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RA), thiazolidinediones (TZD) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) compared with the reference (placebo, no use of antidiabetic agents or other antidiabetic agents). Conversely, insulin was associated with an increased risk of dementia, whereas no significant association was found with the use of metformin, sulfonylureas, glinides and α-glucosidase inhibitors. Analyses of treatment rankings further revealed the relative effect on reducing dementia risk in the following order: SGLT2i > GLP1-RA > TZD > DPP4i; insulin ranked the lowest. The most effective antidiabetic agent in reducing dementia risk in T2DM is SGLT2i, followed by GLP1-RA, TZD and DPP4i, whereas insulin is associated with an elevated risk of dementia.",

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website from database inception to April 21, 2025. We included single-blinded and double-blinded RCTs comparing antidepressants and placebo in acute monotherapy of any psychiatric disorder. We did frequentist random-effects network meta-analyses to investigate treatment-induced changes in weight; total cholesterol; glucose; heart rate; systolic and diastolic blood pressure; corrected QT interval (QTc); sodium; potassium; aspartate transferase (AST); alanine transaminase (ALT); alkaline phosphatase (ALP); bilirubin; urea; and creatinine. We did meta-regressions to examine study-level associations between physiological change and age, sex, and baseline weight. We estimated the correlation between depressive symptom severity change and metabolic parameter change. Of 26 252 citations, 151 studies and 17 FDA reports met inclusion criteria. The overall sample included 58 534 participants, comparing 30 antidepressants with placebo. Median treatment duration was 8 weeks (IQR 6·0-8·5). We observed clinically significant differences between antidepressants in terms of metabolic and haemodynamic effects, including an approximate 4 kg difference in weight-change between agomelatine and maprotiline, over 21 beats-per-minute difference in heart rate change between fluvoxamine and nortriptyline, and over 11 mmHg difference in systolic blood pressure between nortriptyline and doxepin. Paroxetine, duloxetine, desvenlafaxine, and venlafaxine were associated with increases in total cholesterol and, for duloxetine, glucose concentrations, despite all drugs reducing bodyweight. There was strong evidence of duloxetine, desvenlafaxine, and levomilnacipran increasing AST, ALT, and ALP concentrations, although the magnitudes of these alterations were not considered clinically significant. We did not find strong evidence of any antidepressant affecting QTc, or concentrations of sodium, potassium, urea, and creatinine to a clinically significant extent. Higher baseline bodyweight was associated with larger antidepressant-induced increases in systolic blood pressure, ALT, and AST, and higher baseline age was associated with larger antidepressant-induced increases in glucose. We did not observe an association between changes in depressive symptoms and metabolic disturbance. We found strong evidence that antidepressants differ markedly in their physiological effects, particularly for cardiometabolic parameters. Treatment guidelines should be updated to reflect differences in physiological risk, but choice of antidepressant should be made on an individual basis, considering clinical presentation and preferences of patients, carers, and clinicians.

The KARMA-Dep 2 trial was an investigator-led, double-blind, randomized, midazolam-controlled, pragmatic trial conducted at an academic center in Ireland between September 2021 and August 2024. Participants included adults (≥18 years) hospitalized with a DSM-5 major depressive episode (unipolar or bipolar) and baseline Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score ≥20. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive up to 8 twice-weekly intravenous infusions of either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg) as an adjunct to usual-care pharmacotherapy and other aspects of routine inpatient psychiatric care. Participants were followed up for 6 months. The primary outcome was change in depression symptom severity measured by the observer-rated MADRS score from baseline to end of treatment. Secondary outcomes included self-reported depression severity, safety, tolerability, health care costs, and quality of life.

Ticagrelor and double-dose clopidogrel are effective antiplatelet therapies, but no head-to-head comparison exists in this setting. The authors sought to evaluate the efficacy of ticagrelor over twice-daily clopidogrel in reducing MACE events within the first 1 month postprimary PCI. TADCLOT (Twice-A-Day CLOpidogrel vs Ticagrelor), a double-blind, randomized superiority trial at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi, Pakistan (February 19, 2024 to January 30, 2025), randomized 2,201 patients with STEMI within 24 hours of primary PCI 1:1 to ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose, 90 mg twice a day) or twice-daily clopidogrel (600-mg loading dose, 75 mg twice a day) for 1 month. The primary endpoint was MACEs (death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, or target lesion revascularization) at 1 month, analyzed by intention to treat. Secondary endpoints were individual MACE components and clinically significant bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium [BARC] type 2, 3, or 5). Among 2,201 randomized patients, MACEs occurred in 24 (2.2%) ticagrelor patients vs 32 (2.9%) in twice-daily clopidogrel patients (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.44-1.27; P = 0.28; absolute risk difference: -0.7%; 95% CI: -2.05 to 0.60). Cardiovascular death or definite stent thrombosis occurred in 21 (1.9%) vs 27 (2.5%) patients (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.44-1.37). Clinically significant bleeding (BARC type 2, 3, or 5) occurred in 6 patients (0.5%) with ticagrelor vs 4 (0.4%) with clopidogrel (HR: 1.50; 95% CI: 0.42-5.31). Major bleeding (BARC type 3 or 5) was infrequent and similar between the groups: 3 patients (0.3%) in the ticagrelor arm and 2 (0.2%) in the clopidogrel arm (HR: 1.50; 95% CI: 0.25-8.97). At both 7 (HR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.04-0.5; P = 0.002) and 14 days (HR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.23-0.91; P = 0.02), MACEs were significantly lower with ticagrelor compared with twice-daily clopidogrel, although these differences were no longer statistically significant at 30 days. Ticagrelor was not superior to twice-daily clopidogrel in reducing MACEs at 1 month after primary PCI, and bleeding rates were similar. However, event rates were lower than anticipated, and ticagrelor significantly reduced MACEs within the first 2 weeks compared with twice-daily clopidogrel.

We aimed to explore the effects of empagliflozin on a range of kidney outcomes in these population subtypes. In this meta-analysis, we used individual-level data from 23 340 participants in four large placebo-controlled trials (EMPA-REG OUTCOME, EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, and EMPA-KIDNEY) to assess the effects of empagliflozin on conventional and exploratory acute and chronic kidney outcomes. We then assessed whether effects varied by predicted size of the acute eGFR dip on treatment initiation or among other key population subtypes using tests for heterogeneity and trend. The individual-level data were requested from Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim, Germany). Compared with placebo, allocation to empagliflozin reduced the risk of a marker of acute kidney injury (a ≥50% increase in serum creatinine in consecutive follow-up samples) by 20% (hazard ratio 0·80 [95% CI 0·72-0·88]; 1573 outcomes), acute kidney injury adverse events by 27% (0·73 [0·63-0·85]; 694 outcomes), a categorical chronic kidney disease progression outcome by 30% (0·70 [0·63-0·78]; 1403 outcomes), and kidney failure by 34% (0·66 [0·55-0·79]; 490 outcomes).

These kidney benefits were similar in subgroups divided by predicted size of acute eGFR dip, and were present irrespective of diabetes or heart failure status, level of kidney function, or albuminuria.

While several anti-diabetic agents show promise, a comprehensive analysis comparing their efficacy on biopsy-confirmed histological outcomes, including dose-dependent effects and the mediating role of weight loss, remains unexplored. A frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to explore histological efficacy of anti-diabetic agents in biopsy-confirmed MASH without cirrhosis. The primary outcome was fibrosis improvement (≥1 stage) without worsening steatohepatitis; the secondary outcome was MASH resolution without fibrosis worsening. Incretin-based agents were dose-stratified. Treatment ranking used surface-under the cumulative-ranking curve (SUCRA). Meta-regression investigated the impact of percentage weight loss and baseline covariates on the proportion of individuals achieving histological end-points. Data from five RCTs (N = 1667) were included. All active treatments, including Dapagliflozin 10 mg, Survodutide (2.4 mg/wk, 4.8-6 mg/wk), Tirzepatide (5 mg/wk, 10-15 mg/wk), and Semaglutide (0.7-1.4 mg/wk, 2.4 or 2.8 mg/wk), improved fibrosis versus placebo (I = 0%). For MASH resolution, dose-dependent effects led to significant heterogeneity (I = 73%), with lower-dose Semaglutide demonstrating no benefits and Dapagliflozin showing benefits in the F2-F3 subgroup only on sensitivity analysis. Survodutide exhibited the highest ranking (SUCRA = 0.822-0.849), followed by Tirzepatide (SUCRA = 0.622-0.681) and higher-dose Semaglutide (SUCRA = 0.327) for MASH resolution. Meta-regression using data from 16 interventions, including placebo arms, showed that weight loss significantly explained heterogeneity in treatment effects on fibrosis improvement (R = 54.26%) and MASH resolution (R = 78.16%). SGLT2 inhibitor and incretin-based agents improved fibrosis in MASH, with weight loss being a significant mediator. Targeting multiple incretin pathways, especially involving glucagon receptors, may offer greater MASH resolution.

However, the association between different adiposity-related anthropometrics and cardiovascular outcomes in persons with CKM conditions has not been rigorously explored. In this study, the authors sought to examine cardiovascular outcomes and treatment effects of finerenone according to different adiposity-related anthropometrics. In this prespecified participant-level pooled analysis of FIDELIO-DKD, FIGARO-DKD, and FINEARTS-HF (FINE-HEART), cardiovascular outcomes and treatment effects of finerenone according to baseline body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-height ratio (WHtR), and waist-hip ratio (WHR) were evaluated with the use of multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression and Poisson regression. Of 18,759 participants with available data for all anthropometrics, 52% had a BMI ≥30 kg/m and 98% had any excess adiposity. Among those with BMI <30 kg/m, 95% had increased abdominal adiposity, especially women and older individuals. Higher BMI, WC, WHtR, and WHR were each significantly associated with a wide range of cardiovascular outcomes, including cardiovascular death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization and its individual components, major adverse cardiovascular events, new-onset atrial fibrillation, and incident HF hospitalization. BMI-adjusted WHtR and WHtR-adjusted BMI were each associated with a higher rate of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization, and participants with elevated BMI and WHtR experienced a higher rate of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization compared with those with elevated BMI or WHtR alone (P < 0.001). Benefits of finerenone on cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization were consistent regardless of baseline BMI (P = 0.27) or WHtR (P = 0.26), and absolute benefits appeared to be greater among participants with higher adiposity. Serious adverse events were less common with finerenone vs placebo, regardless of baseline BMI category (P = 0.08). These findings suggest that assessment of anthropometrics capturing abdominal adiposity, in addition to BMI, may enhance obesity identification and risk stratification among individuals with CKM conditions.

For those who fail to respond to CMM, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) should be considered as an effective adjunctive therapy for improving pain, disability and health-related quality of life. SOLIS is a prospective, multicenter trial that randomized patients with non-surgical, refractory back pain (with or without leg pain) to receive either SCS combined with CMM or CMM alone. The primary endpoint at 3 months compared the proportion of patients with ≥50% overall pain relief without an increase in mean daily opioid use between the SCS+CMM and CMM groups. Three months after treatment activation, patients initially randomized to receive CMM alone had the option to cross over and add SCS to their pain management regimen. Patients in both randomized groups underwent 12-month follow-up visits to assess long-term effects on pain relief, disability, health-related quality of life, global impression of change, and treatment satisfaction. 147 patients were randomized to SCS+CMM (n=79) or CMM alone (n=68). At the 3-month follow-up, 89.5% of patients who received SCS+CMM (including subperception and paresthesia-based programming modalities) and 8.1% who received CMM alone were classified as study responders (≥50% pain relief without an increase in mean daily opioid use; modified intention-to-treat analysis, p<0.0001). The level of disability due to low back pain improved significantly: the Oswestry Disability Index score decreased by -27.5±15.9 points in the SCS+CMM group versus -7.2±9.9 points in the CMM alone group (p<0.0001). Health-related quality of life also improved at 3 months: the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level questionnaire index score increased by 0.247±0.164 points in the SCS+CMM group versus 0.031±0.151 points in the CMM alone group (p<0.0001). The benefits of SCS were sustained until the 12-month visit. Seven patients experienced serious adverse events related to SCS, including 5 (3.6%) implant site infections resulting in explant. SCS relieved pain and resulted in clinically significant improvements in functional disability and health-related quality of life in patients with non-surgical, refractory back pain with or without accompanying leg pain.

Because deaths from prostate cancer are expected to rise worldwide owing to increased life expectancy and population growth, a final analysis of the long-term outcomes of prostate cancer screening is essential to understanding the benefits and harms of PSA testing. We updated the findings from ERSPC, a multicenter, randomized study conducted across eight European countries with a focus on a predefined core age group of 162,236 men who were 55 to 69 years of age at the time of randomization. Participants were randomly assigned to the screening group and offered repeated PSA testing or to the control group and not invited for screening. The primary outcome was prostate cancer mortality. After a median follow-up of 23 years, prostate cancer mortality was 13% lower in the screening group (rate ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 0.95), and the absolute risk reduction was 0.22% (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.34). The cumulative incidence of prostate cancer was higher in the screening group than in the control group (rate ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.33). At a median of 23 years of follow-up, one death from prostate cancer was prevented for every 456 men (95% CI, 306 to 943) who were invited for screening, and one death from prostate cancer was averted for every 12 men (95% CI, 8 to 26) in whom prostate cancer was diagnosed, as compared with one death from prostate cancer prevented for every 628 men (95% CI, 419 to 1481) and one death averted for every 18 men (95% CI, 12 to 45) at 16 years of follow-up. Long-term follow-up confirms a sustained reduction in deaths from prostate cancer with PSA testing, alongside an improved harm-benefit ratio.

Although combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy may reduce ischemic risk, it also increases bleeding, and the optimal antithrombotic strategy remains uncertain. To determine whether adding an antiplatelet agent to anticoagulant therapy influences the net clinical benefit in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and concurrent nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This multicenter, open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted at 41 sites across Japan from November 2016 to March 2025. Eligible patients had an ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within 8 to 360 days of onset, nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and at least 1 manifestation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (carotid or intracranial artery stenosis, noncardioembolic stroke, ischemic heart disease, or peripheral artery disease). Data were analyzed from April 16, 2024, to October 14, 2024. Patients were randomized to receive combination therapy (anticoagulant plus antiplatelet) or anticoagulant monotherapy. The primary outcome was a composite of ischemic cardiovascular events and major bleeding within 2 years. Secondary outcomes included ischemic cardiovascular events; safety outcomes included major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. In total, 316 patients were randomized to combination therapy (n = 159) or monotherapy (n = 157) (mean [SD] age, 77.2 [7.4] years; 90 female patients [28.5%]). The trial was terminated on July 18, 2023, after an interim analysis for futility. The cumulative incidence of the primary outcome was 17.8% in the combination therapy group and 19.6% in the monotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91; 95% CI, 0.53-1.55; P = .64). Ischemic cardiovascular events occurred in 11.1% and 14.2% (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.39-1.48; P = .41), and major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 19.5% and 8.6% (HR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.23-4.76; P = .008) of combination therapy and monotherapy groups, respectively. In this randomized clinical trial, in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and concurrent nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, adding an antiplatelet agent to anticoagulant therapy provided no net clinical benefit over anticoagulant monotherapy, with higher bleeding risk.

Patients were randomly assigned in blocks (block sizes depended on the number of interventions available) to one of eight treatment groups, including oral ensitrelvir and oral ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir at standard doses, both given for 5 days, and no study drug. The primary endpoint was the oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance rate assessed between day 0 and day 5 in the modified intention-to-treat population (defined as patients with at least 2 days of follow-up). Patients had four oropharyngeal swabs taken on day 0 and two swabs taken daily from days 1 to 7, then on days 10 and 14. Viral clearance rates were derived under a Bayesian hierarchical linear model fitted to log viral densities in standardised paired oropharyngeal swab eluates taken daily over the 5 days (14 samples).

      "abstract": "Limited data suggest a benefit of population-based screening for cardiovascular disease (CVD) with respect to mortality. A population-based, parallel-randomized controlled trial of Danish men aged 60-64 years randomized 1:4 to invitation to screening for subclinical CVD or no invitation (control group) were performed. Allocation was based on computer-generated random numbers and stratified on municipality. Only the control group was blinded. The screening included coronary artery calcification score, aneurysms, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. Intervention included statin, aspirin and surveillance. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. 31,268 participants were randomized; 25,322 men in the control arm and 5,946 in the invited arm, of whom 3,720 attended and were screened (62·6%). In intention-to-treat analyses, after a median follow-up of 7·0 years, 555 (9.3%) men in the intervention group and 2,509 (9·9%) men in the control group had died; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.94 (95% CI: 0·86;1·03), p=0·169.Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were registered in 606 (10·2%) versus 2,682 (10·6%) (HR=0·96 [95% CI 0·88;1.04]; p=0·319).Severe bleedings were significantly more common in the invited-to-screening group (6·0% versus 5·1%; HR=1·18 [95% CI 1·05;1·32]; p=0·007).

      "abstract": "Endometriosis is a hormone-sensitive inflammatory condition affecting between 5% and 10% of reproductive-aged women and an unknown number of gender-diverse individuals. It is often associated with debilitating pelvic pain symptoms. Various formulations of progestagens (e.g. oral, depot, implantable) have been studied as potential treatments for endometriosis because they induce atrophy of endometrial tissue. To determine the benefits and harms of progestagens in the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain symptoms. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO on 29 October 2024 without language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing progestagens for symptomatic endometriosis against placebo, other medications, or different doses of progestagens. Studies assessing the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device were ineligible, as a separate Cochrane review covers this intervention. Participants were of reproductive age with a laparoscopic diagnosis of endometriosis and associated pain symptoms. Primary outcomes included endometriosis-associated pain symptoms (overall pain, pelvic pain, and dysmenorrhoea). Secondary outcomes included quality of life, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects. At least two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We reported dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) and continuous outcomes as mean differences (MDs), each with its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). The meta-analysis employed a fixed-effect model, and we assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I statistic. We used GRADE to assess evidence certainty. We included 33 RCTs involving 5059 participants with symptomatic, laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis. We judged 13 studies at overall low risk of bias. The following comparisons are limited by the small number of studies reporting each outcome. Pain outcomes, quality of life, and patient satisfaction were measured at six months unless otherwise specified. Oral progestagens versus placebo or no treatment (8 studies) Oral progestagens compared with placebo probably reduce overall pain measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS; MD -2.58, 95% CI -3.13 to -2.03; moderate certainty), and probably reduce dysmenorrhoea at three months (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.70, moderate certainty), but may have little to no effect on pelvic pain at three months (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.69; low certainty). Oral progestagens improve quality of life (SF-36 score; MD 4.11, 95% CI 2.41 to 5.82, high certainty). There is probably little to no difference between the interventions in study withdrawal due to adverse effects (RR 2.36, CI 0.74 to 7.52, moderate certainty) and cumulative side effects (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.46, moderate certainty). Oral progestagens versus oral contraceptives (4 studies) Oral progestagens compared with oral contraceptives probably have little to no effect on pelvic pain measured on a VAS (MD 0.38, 95% CI -0.46 to 1.22, moderate certainty). There was very low-certainty evidence about their effect on dysmenorrhoea at 12 months (MD -0.57, 95% CI -1.29 to 0.15), quality of life (SF-36 general health perception; MD 5.2, 95% CI -1.3 to 11.70), and patient satisfaction (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.57). Oral progestagens may lead to better quality of life (SF-36 pain score; MD 11.5, 95% CI 2.35 to 20.65, low certainty). There may be little to no difference between oral progestagens and oral contraceptives in study withdrawal due to adverse effects (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.07, low certainty), and there is probably little to no difference in cumulative side effects (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.60, moderate certainty). Oral progestagens versus gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (10 studies) Oral progestagens compared with GnRH agonists may have little to no effect on overall pain measured on a VAS (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.28), risk of pelvic pain (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.59), dysmenorrhoea (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.00), SF-36 physical health score (MD 0.40, 95% CI -1.58 to 2.38), SF-36 mental health score (MD -0.50, 95% CI -3.75 to 2.75), patient satisfaction (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.26), and study withdrawal due to adverse effects (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.43). All these outcomes had low-certainty evidence. The risk of cumulative side effects was probably higher with oral progestagens (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.86, moderate certainty). Depot progestagens versus GnRH agonists (2 studies) Depot progestagens compared with GnRH agonists reduce dysmenorrhoea risk slightly (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.97, high certainty) but may have little to no effect on pelvic pain (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.07, low certainty). The interventions may be similar in study withdrawal due to adverse effects (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.24 to 8.32, low certainty), but the risk of cumulative side effects is probably lower with depot progestagens (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.11, moderate certainty). Depot progestagens versus GnRH antagonist (1 study) Depot progestagens compared with GNRH agonists may have little to no effect on pelvic pain (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.03, low certainty), dysmenorrhoea (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.03, low certainty), and cumulative adverse effects (RR 1.04, 0.95 to 1.14, low certainty). Study withdrawal due to side effects is likely higher with depot progestagens (RR 2.02, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.94, moderate certainty). Depot progestagens versus the etonogestrel implant (1 study) There was very low-certainty evidence about the effect of depot progestagens versus the etonogestrel implant on overall pain measured on a VAS (MD 0.80, 95% CI - 0.42 to 2.02), patient satisfaction (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.66), and study withdrawal due to adverse effects (RR 1.84, 95% CI 0.63 to 5.33). In individuals with endometriosis, oral progestagens compared with placebo likely reduce overall pain and dysmenorrhoea and may reduce pelvic pain. Compared with other hormonal suppression strategies, the evidence is less certain due to the small number of studies for each comparison and outcome. Despite such limitations, this update provides a comprehensive overview and valuable insights on progestagen treatment for endometriosis, emphasising the nuanced balance between efficacy, adverse effects, and patient satisfaction.",

The following comparisons are limited by the small number of studies reporting each outcome. Pain outcomes, quality of life, and patient satisfaction were measured at six months unless otherwise specified. Oral progestagens versus placebo or no treatment (8 studies) Oral progestagens compared with placebo probably reduce overall pain measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS; MD -2.58, 95% CI -3.13 to -2.03; moderate certainty), and probably reduce dysmenorrhoea at three months (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.70, moderate certainty), but may have little to no effect on pelvic pain at three months (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.69; low certainty). Oral progestagens improve quality of life (SF-36 score; MD 4.11, 95% CI 2.41 to 5.82, high certainty).

There was very low-certainty evidence about their effect on dysmenorrhoea at 12 months (MD -0.57, 95% CI -1.29 to 0.15), quality of life (SF-36 general health perception; MD 5.2, 95% CI -1.3 to 11.70), and patient satisfaction (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.57). Oral progestagens may lead to better quality of life (SF-36 pain score; MD 11.5, 95% CI 2.35 to 20.65, low certainty).

Although corticosteroids remain the standard first-line therapy for aGVHD, up to 50% of patients become steroid-refractory (SR). REACH2 is a phase III study of ruxolitinib versus best available therapy (BAT) in patients age 12 years and older with SR-aGVHD after Allo-HCT. We present the final efficacy and safety outcomes from REACH2 after 24 months of treatment. Cumulative median (range) duration of response was 167 (22-677) days with ruxolitinib and 106 (10-526) days with BAT. Median overall survival and event-free survival were 10.7 and 8.3 months for ruxolitinib, compared with 5.8 and 4.2 months, respectively, with BAT. Median failure-free survival was significantly longer with ruxolitinib than with BAT (4.86  1.02 months,  < .001). Similar numbers of nonrelapse mortality events were observed with ruxolitinib and BAT (72  71), and malignancy relapse/progression events remained low across both groups. Numerically higher chronic GVHD rates were noted with ruxolitinib than with BAT from 12 months; however, 95% confidence intervals overlapped. Safety observations were consistent with the primary analysis results. Ruxolitinib provided efficacy advantages over BAT in patients with SR-aGVHD over 24 months.",

      "abstract": "Cumulative evidence supports the beneficial effects of intensive blood pressure (BP)-lowering treatment to prevent cardiovascular events and death; however, the effects of a more aggressive BP target on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) remain unclear. This study aimed to compare the effects of intensive vs standard BP-lowering treatment strategies on long-term change in HRQoL among hypertensive patients with high cardiovascular risk. The ESPRIT (Effects of Intensive Systolic Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment in Reducing Risk of Vascular Events) trial was an open-label, blinded-outcome, randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either intensive BP-lowering treatment (targeting standard office systolic blood pressure [SBP] to <120 mm Hg) or standard BP-lowering treatment (targeting office SBP to <140 mm Hg). HRQoL was assessed by using the 5-level EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) at baseline and the final follow-up visit. Covariance analyses were applied to evaluate the effect of treatment assignment on changes in HRQoL. The current study included 5,398 participants in the intensive treatment group and 5,406 participants in the standard treatment group. Over 3.4 years of follow-up, the EQ-5D visual analog scale scores increased by 0.56 point in the intensive treatment group and decreased by 0.50 point in the standard treatment group, resulting in a mean difference of 1.26 (95% CI: 0.55 to 1.98; P < 0.001). Compared with the standard treatment, the intensive treatment was associated with a 16% higher likelihood of meaningful improvement than worsening in EQ-5D visual analog scale (relative risk: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.04-1.30; P = 0.007). Categorical changes from baseline to the final follow-up visit in 5 domains between the 2 groups showed no statistical differences. Intensive BP treatment, targeting office SBP to <120 mm Hg, produced modest benefits to HRQoL among hypertensive patients with high cardiovascular risk.

To determine if the proportion of patients with a platelet response is significantly greater in patients with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia treated with eltrombopag than in those treated with standard therapy (first-line treatments). This phase 3, randomized clinical trial enrolled patients (aged 1-<18 years) with newly diagnosed primary immune thrombocytopenia (platelet count <30 × 109/L who required pharmacological treatment but did not have severe bleeding or need a rapid increase in platelet count) from May 7, 2019, to January 25, 2024, at 23 centers participating in the Pediatric ITP Consortium of North America.

We searched multiple electronic databases from inception through August 14, 2024, to identify randomized controlled trials in adults with moderate-to-severe CD, comparing advanced therapies (eg, tumor necrosis factor antagonists, vedolizumab, interleukin 12/23, or interleukin 23p19 antagonists, and/or Janus kinase inhibitors) with placebo or another active comparator. Our primary outcomes were induction and maintenance of clinical remission; analyses were stratified by biologic therapy exposure status. We performed a network meta-analysis using a frequentist approach and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise certainty of evidence. We identified 28 trials of induction therapy and 22 trials of maintenance therapy of advanced therapies in patients with moderate-to-severe CD. In biologic-naïve patients, moderate-to-high certainty evidence supported the use of infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab, and guselkumab, and low certainty evidence supported the use of certolizumab pegol and upadacitinib over no treatment for inducing remission. Among active comparators, moderate-to-high certainty evidence supported the use of adalimumab and ustekinumab compared with certolizumab pegol and upadacitinib. Among patients with prior exposure to biologics, moderate-to-high certainty evidence supported the use of adalimumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, guselkumab, and upadacitinib, and low certainty evidence supported the use of vedolizumab and mirikizumab, over no treatment, for inducing remission. Among active comparators, moderate certainty evidence supported the use of risankizumab and guselkumab compared with vedolizumab and ustekinumab. Using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise quality of evidence, this updated network meta-analysis can inform positioning of advanced therapies for the treatment of biologic-naïve and biologic-exposed patients with moderate-to-severe CD.",

This 12-week randomised clinical trial enrolled postmenopausal women with moderate-to-severe VVA to receive treatment with MAP, promestriene or placebo hydrogel. The primary outcome was the decrease in severity of most bothersome symptom (MBS) between baseline and 12 weeks. Additional measures included a composite vaginal symptom index, vaginal health index, female sexual function index (FSFI) score, vaginal pH, vaginal maturation value, vaginal microecology, treatment satisfaction, meaningful benefit and treatment safety. We recruited 105 participants, and 96 provided data for the study analysis. Three treatments had similar mean reductions in MBS severity over 12 weeks: MAP, -1.72 (95% CI, -1.91 to -1.53); promestriene, -1.55 (95% CI, -1.86 to -1.24) and placebo, -1.71 (95% CI, -1.95 to -1.48). Compared to the placebo, the MAP significantly improved the Satisfaction (P = .003) of the FSFI. In addition, the MAP and promestriene improved the vaginal microecology significantly. Adjusted for age and year after menopause, the mean reductions in MBS and the mean improvements in FSFI of MAP were comparable with promestriene (MBS, P = .410; FSFI, P = .233) but greater than the placebo (MBS, P = .028; FSFI, P = .046).

To evaluate the relative efficacy of a hybrid chatbot in increasing PV uptake among Hong Kong residents aged 65 years or older. This partially masked, parallel-group randomized clinical trial was conducted between May 1, 2023, and November 30, 2024 in Hong Kong, China. Participants were aged 65 years or older, had a Hong Kong identity card, could speak and comprehend Cantonese, were smartphone and WhatsApp users, and had no prior PV uptake. Participants were recruited through random telephone calls and were randomized to either the stage of change group or the standard intervention group. In the stage of change group, the rule-based component of the hybrid chatbot assessed participants' stage of change regarding PV uptake and then delivered stage of change-tailored interventions at months 0, 1, 2, and 3. The natural language processing component of the hybrid chatbot provided real-time answers to participants' PV-related questions. In the standard intervention group, the chatbot sent participants a link to access a standard online video covering PV information at months 0, 1, 2, and 3. The primary outcome was self-reported PV uptake at month 12, which was validated by the research team. The secondary outcome was participants' stage of change measured at month 0 and month 12 by using validated questions, with a score of 1 = precontemplation, 2 = contemplation, 3 = preparation, and 4 = action. A total of 374 participants (213 female [57.0%]; mean [SD] age, 69.6 [3.1] years) were randomized to either the stage of change group (n = 187) or the standard intervention group (n = 187). The intention-to-treat analysis showed that the validated PV uptake rate was higher in the stage of change group than in the standard intervention group (29.4% vs 18.7%; P = .01). The mean (SD) stage of change score was higher in the stage of change group than in the standard intervention group (2.2 [1.3] vs 1.9 [1.1]; P = .02). More participants in the stage of change group than in the standard intervention group completed at least 1 intervention session (79.7% vs 57.8%; P < .001). In this randomized clinical trial, the hybrid chatbot was more efficacious than the standard intervention in increasing PV uptake among older adults in Hong Kong.

These shifts can influence the risk-benefit balance of interventions such as implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), which are designed to prevent sudden cardiac death. Long-term follow-up is therefore essential to determine whether early benefits are sustained, attenuated, or lost over time. This study sought to examine the long-term effect of primary prevention ICD implantation, compared with usual clinical care, in patients with nonischemic HFrEF enrolled in the DANISH (Danish Study To Assess the Efficacy of ICDs in Patients With Nonischemic Systolic Heart Failure on Mortality) trial. The DANISH trial enrolled 1,116 patients with nonischemic HFrEF, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%, NYHA functional class II-III (class IV if cardiac resynchronization therapy was planned), and elevated natriuretic peptide levels. The primary outcome was all-cause death, and secondary outcomes were cardiovascular death and sudden cardiovascular death. In this study with extended follow-up, patients were followed until death or January 31, 2024, whichever came first. During a median follow-up of 13.2 years (Q1-Q3: 11.6-14.6 years), 294 patients (52.9%) in the ICD group and 299 (53.4%) in the control group died. Compared with usual clinical care, ICD implantation did not significantly reduce the long-term rate of all-cause death (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.82-1.13), but it did reduce the long-term rate of sudden cardiovascular death (HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.36-0.80). The effect of ICD implantation on all-cause death was consistent regardless of age (P = 0.89). However, age significantly modified the effect of ICD implantation on sudden cardiovascular death, such that ICD implantation reduced the rate of this outcome in patients ≤70 years (HR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.23-0.62), but not in those >70 years (HR: 1.27; 95% CI: 0.56-2.89; P = 0.01). Similar trends were observed when age was analyzed as a continuous variable. The effect of ICD implantation was generally consistent across other key subgroups, including cardiac resynchronization therapy use at baseline. In patients with nonischemic HFrEF, during a median follow-up of 13.2 years, primary prevention ICD implantation did not reduce all-cause death, but it did reduce sudden cardiovascular death, and younger individuals appeared to derive a greater benefit.
