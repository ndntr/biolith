      "abstract": "The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with acute coronary syndrome remains uncertain. This analysis examined the temporal patterns of ischaemic and bleeding risks of early aspirin withdrawal compared with DAPT. NEO-MINDSET randomized 3410 acute coronary syndrome patients undergoing successful percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents within 4 days of hospital admission to either potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (prasugrel or ticagrelor) or standard DAPT (aspirin plus a potent P2Y12 inhibitor) for 12 months. This prespecified landmark analysis examined early (0-30 days) and late (31-365 days) follow-up events. Co-primary outcomes were (i) the composite of all cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or urgent target-vessel revascularization (ischaemic outcome) and (ii) Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding. At 30 days, the composite ischaemic outcome occurred in 3.3% of patients receiving monotherapy vs 1.8% with DAPT (risk difference 1.5%, 95% confidence interval .4%-2.6%; P = .006). Bleeding occurred in .6% vs 1.5% (risk difference -.8%, 95% confidence interval -1.5%-.1%; P = .018). In the landmark analysis between Days 31 and 365, ischaemic outcome rates were similar between study groups (3.8% each; P = .977), while bleeding remained less frequent with monotherapy (1.3% vs 3.5%; risk difference -2.2%, 95% confidence interval -3.2%-1.1%; P > .001). This prespecified 30-day landmark analysis suggests an excess of ischaemic risk with monotherapy vs DAPT in the first 30 days but not thereafter, whereas an aspirin-free strategy was consistently associated with fewer bleeding events within and after 30 days.",

      "abstract": "Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is common in women and frequently associated with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). SUI may be present following prolapse reduction (occult SUI) and may develop after surgery for POP (new-onset SUI). To determine the impact of surgery for symptomatic POP, with or without concomitant or delayed two-stage continence procedures, to treat or prevent SUI, on postoperative bladder function. We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, two trials registries, journals and conference proceedings (searched 29 April 2024, updated 23 July 2025), and reference lists of articles. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including surgical interventions for POP with or without continence procedures in continent or incontinent women. Our primary outcome was subjective postoperative SUI. Secondary outcomes included POP on examination, overactive bladder, further continence surgery, and voiding dysfunction. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We assessed evidence certainty using GRADE. We included 22 RCTs with 3095 women. Evidence certainty ranged from low to moderate. Limitations were risk of bias (especially blinding of outcome assessors), indirectness, and imprecision associated with low event rates and small samples. POP surgery in women with SUI Vaginal POP surgery with versus without midurethral sling: a concomitant midurethral sling may decrease SUI, (risk ratio (RR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.48; 2 studies, 319 women), and rates of further continence surgery (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.74; 1 study, 134 women), both low-certainty evidence. This suggests that if the risk of SUI with POP surgery alone is 39%, the risk with midurethral sling is between 8% and 19%. Vaginal POP surgery with concomitant versus delayed midurethral sling: low-certainty evidence suggested little or no difference in SUI (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.37; 1 study, 140 women). Vaginal transobturator mesh versus vaginal POP surgery with midurethral sling: evidence from one study with 84 women suggested little or no difference in SUI (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.26); POP (RR 6.29, 95% CI 0.79 to 50.03); new-onset overactive bladder (RR not estimable); and voiding dysfunction (RR 3.14, 95% CI 0.13 to 75.02), low-certainty evidence. Abdominal sacrocolpopexy with versus without Burch colposuspension: an additional Burch colposuspension may have little or no effect on SUI after five years (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.26; 45 women), or on overactive bladder (RR 0.85, 95%CI 0.61 to 1.18), new-onset overactive bladder (RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.19 to 19.73) or voiding dysfunction (RR 0.96, 95%CI 0.06 to 14.43) all after one year (1 study, 47 women, all low-certainty evidence). Abdominal sacrocolpopexy with concomitant midurethral sling or Burch colposuspension: midurethral sling may decrease SUI at two years (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.86; 113 women) but not POP (RR 1.85, 95%CI 0.18 to 19.62; 79 women), overactive bladder (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.94; 44 women), new-onset overactive bladder (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.06 to 6.09; 48 women), or voiding dysfunction (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.90; 92 women), low-certainty evidence from one study. This suggests that if the risk of SUI with Burch is 55%, the risk with midurethral sling is between 19% and 48%. POP surgery in women with occult SUI Vaginal POP surgery with versus without midurethral sling: probably decreases SUI (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.55; 5 studies, 369 women) and further continence surgery rates (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.53; 4 studies, 279 women) both moderate-certainty evidence. This suggests that if the risk with POP surgery alone is 34%, the risk with concomitant midurethral sling is between 10% and 22%. Low-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference in POP (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.19; 1 study, 50 women), overactive bladder (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.07; 1 study, 43 women), new-onset overactive bladder (RR 2.11, 95% CI 0.73 to 6.11; 2 studies, 75 women) or voiding dysfunction (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.15 to 6.55; 1 study, 50 women). POP surgery in stress urinary continent women Vaginal POP surgery with versus without concomitant midurethral sling: there is probably no difference in SUI between groups (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.00; 1 study, 220 women; moderate-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the risk with POP surgery alone is 40%, the risk with concomitant midurethral sling is between 19% and 40%. Abdominal sacrocolpopexy with versus without Burch colposuspension: there may be little or no effect on SUI after two years (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99; I² = 75%; 2 studies, 364 women; low-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the risk with sacrocolpopexy alone is 36%, the risk with concomitant Burch colposuspension is between 19% and 36%. Low-certainty evidence from one study suggests there may be little or no difference in POP (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.30, 250 women), new-onset overactive bladder (RR 1.41, 95%CI 0.25 to 7.91, 66 women) and voiding dysfunction (RR 8.49, 95% CI 0.48 to 151.59, 66 women). Vaginal transobturator mesh repair versus native tissue repair: low-certainty evidence suggests that transobturator mesh repair may increase SUI at 3-7 years (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.91; 3 studies, 417 women) but may decrease POP (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.52 ; 3 studies, 458 women). There may be little or no difference in voiding dysfunction at 12 months (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.22 to 12.10; 2 studies, 125 women). In women with POP and symptomatic or occult SUI, a concomitant midurethral sling probably reduces SUI, but adverse effects remain unclear. It is also feasible to postpone the midurethral sling and perform a continence procedure only if required. In continent women, a Burch colposuspension during abdominal POP surgery reduced new-onset SUI rates in one underpowered study, but another RCT reported conflicting results. Adding a midurethral sling during vaginal POP repair might prevent new-onset SUI. An anterior native tissue repair might be better than vaginal transobturator mesh for preventing new SUI; however, POP recurrence may be more common with native tissue repair.",

      "abstract": "Extended-release injectable buprenorphine may expand the reach of initiating medications for opioid use disorder in high-risk and hard-to-reach individuals who visit the emergency department (ED) and can be administered in low levels of withdrawal. To compare the effect of ED-initiated 7-day extended-release injectable buprenorphine vs sublingual buprenorphine on treatment engagement at 7 days. Multicenter randomized clinical trial enrolling adult patients presenting to the ED with untreated opioid use disorder and a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score of 4 or higher across 29 EDs in the US from July 12, 2020, to August 21, 2024. Final follow-up was completed on October 24, 2024. Patients were randomized to receive a 24-mg injection of extended-release buprenorphine (equivalent to 16 mg/d) or sublingual buprenorphine, which included either self-administration instructions if the COWS score was less than 8 or administration of 8 mg of sublingual buprenorphine in the ED if the COWS score was 8 or higher. All sublingual buprenorphine group patients received a 7-day prescription for 16 mg/d. Both groups were provided referral for ongoing medication with a scheduled appointment within 7 days. Engagement in opioid use disorder treatment on day 7 was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included engagement at 30 days, precipitated withdrawal and overdose events, craving scores, days of illicit opioid use, and patient satisfaction with treatment. Among 2000 patients randomized, 6 who were enrolled twice were excluded, resulting in 991 in the extended-release group and 1003 in the sublingual group. The median age was 37 (IQR, 30-47) years, 68% were male, 31% had an initial COWS score of 4 to 7, and 76% tested positive for fentanyl. The adjusted proportion of engagement in opioid use disorder treatment at 7 days was 40.5% with extended-release buprenorphine vs 38.5% with sublingual buprenorphine (adjusted difference, 1.6%; 95% CI, -2.8% to 6.0%). Engagement at 30 days was similar, with adjusted proportions of 43.8% with extended-release buprenorphine vs 44.9% with sublingual buprenorphine (adjusted difference, -1.5%; 95% CI, -6.2% to 3.2%). Precipitated withdrawal was rare: 6 (0.6%) with extended-release buprenorphine and 8 (0.8%) with sublingual buprenorphine. Overdose events within 30 days occurred in 18 participants (2.3%) in each group. Patients receiving extended-release buprenorphine reported lower mean craving scores at 7 days vs those receiving sublingual buprenorphine (scale, 0-100; mean score, 26.5 vs 30.2, respectively; adjusted mean difference, -3.85; 95% CI, -7.08 to -0.63), fewer days of illicit opioid use in the past 7 days (adjusted ratio of means, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.95), and better treatment satisfaction scores (scale, 1-5; adjusted mean difference, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.01-0.25). No difference was detected in opioid use disorder treatment engagement on day 7 between the 7-day extended-release and sublingual buprenorphine groups. Both buprenorphine formulations were well tolerated; precipitated withdrawal was rare despite a high prevalence of fentanyl. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04225598.",

The median age was 37 (IQR, 30-47) years, 68% were male, 31% had an initial COWS score of 4 to 7, and 76% tested positive for fentanyl. The adjusted proportion of engagement in opioid use disorder treatment at 7 days was 40.5% with extended-release buprenorphine vs 38.5% with sublingual buprenorphine (adjusted difference, 1.6%; 95% CI, -2.8% to 6.0%). Engagement at 30 days was similar, with adjusted proportions of 43.8% with extended-release buprenorphine vs 44.9% with sublingual buprenorphine (adjusted difference, -1.5%; 95% CI, -6.2% to 3.2%). Precipitated withdrawal was rare: 6 (0.6%) with extended-release buprenorphine and 8 (0.8%) with sublingual buprenorphine. Overdose events within 30 days occurred in 18 participants (2.3%) in each group. Patients receiving extended-release buprenorphine reported lower mean craving scores at 7 days vs those receiving sublingual buprenorphine (scale, 0-100; mean score, 26.5 vs 30.2, respectively; adjusted mean difference, -3.85; 95% CI, -7.08 to -0.63), fewer days of illicit opioid use in the past 7 days (adjusted ratio of means, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.95), and better treatment satisfaction scores (scale, 1-5; adjusted mean difference, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.01-0.25)."

We employed a prevalent new-user design that emulates a randomized trial within the French national health care database population between 2008 and 2024. Thus, subjects initiating a second- and third-generation BCR-ABL TKI were matched on time and propensity score with users of the first-generation BCR-ABL TKI, imatinib. Patients were followed to occurrence of the primary outcome (ie, new onset of PAH), switch to another BCR-ABL TKI, death from any cause, end of registration within the database, or end of the study period, whichever came first. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models, and incidence rates and corresponding 95% CIs were calculated using the Poisson distribution.

Bosutinib and ponatinib were associated with HRs of 10.76 (95% CI, 4.68-24.73) and 7.74 (95% CI, 2.33-25.70) respectively, with most cases occurring in patients previously exposed to dasatinib. Nilotinib and asciminib were not associated with an increased risk of PAH. This study, designed to emulate a randomized trial, suggests that, in French patients with chronic myeloid leukemia treated with BCR-ABL TKIs, dasatinib use is associated with a higher risk of PAH compared with imatinib, while bosutinib and ponatinib exposure may aggravate or trigger a recurrence of PAH in patients with preexisting dasatinib exposure.

In this meta-analysis of individual participant-level data from double-blind randomised controlled trials, we generated a list of all undesirable effect terms listed in statin SmPCs by searching an electronic medicines compendium for five statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin). Randomised trials were eligible for meta-analysis of these effects if they involved at least 1000 participants, had a scheduled treatment period of at least 2 years, and involved a double-blind comparison of statin versus placebo or of a more intensive versus a less intensive statin regimen. Event rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were calculated with statistical significance assessed after controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at 5%. 19 trials compared statin versus placebo (123 940 participants, median follow-up 4·5 years [IQR 3·1-5·4]). In addition to previously reported effects on muscle outcomes and diabetes, only four of 66 further undesirable outcomes that had been attributed to statins were FDR significant: abnormal liver transaminases (783 participants [0·30% per annum] allocated statin vs 556 [0·22% per annum] allocated placebo, RR 1·41 [95% CI 1·26-1·57]) and other liver function test abnormalities (651 participants [0·25% per annum] allocated statin vs 518 [0·20% per annum] allocated placebo, RR 1·26 [1·12-1·41]; absolute annual excess of 0·13% for combined liver function test abnormality), urinary composition alteration (556 [0·21% per annum] allocated statin vs 472 [0·18% per annum] allocated placebo, RR 1·18 [1·04-1·33]), and oedema (3495 [1·38% per annum] allocated statin vs 3299 [1·31% per annum] allocated placebo, RR 1·07 [1·02-1·12]). Analysis of the four trials of more intensive versus less intensive statin regimens also found significant excesses for abnormal liver transaminases and other liver function test abnormalities (supporting a dose-dependent effect), but no significant excess was found for urinary composition alteration or oedema.

      "abstract": "The combination of doravirine and islatravir is under investigation as a fixed-dose, single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV-1. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of switching to doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) from bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1. This phase 3, randomised, controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority trial was conducted at 49 research, community, and hospital-based clinics in six countries: Australia, Chile, Israel, Japan, the UK, and the USA. Adults aged 18 years or older with HIV-1, who were virologically suppressed (with a viral load of HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) for at least 3 consecutive months on bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide and had no history of treatment failure or known resistance to doravirine, were eligible for the study. Participants were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule with a block size of three, to switch to oral doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) or to continue bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, once daily. Participants, investigators, study staff, and sponsor personnel were masked to study treatment; sponsor personnel directly involved in this analysis were unmasked at week 48. The primary endpoint, which was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study treatment, was the percentage of participants with a viral load of 50 copies per mL or higher at week 48 according to the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot approach; non-inferiority would be concluded if the upper bound of the multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI for the treatment difference was less than 4%. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05630755, and is ongoing but closed to enrolment. Between Feb 17 and Nov 17, 2023, 585 individuals were screened, of whom 514 were randomly assigned and 513 treated: 342 participants were switched to doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) and 171 continued bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide. The median age of the 513 participants was 47 years (IQR 37-58), 403 (79%) were assigned male and 110 (21%) were assigned female at birth, 158 (31%) were Black or African American, and 117 (23%) were Hispanic, Latino, or Latina. At week 48, doravirine and islatravir showed non-inferiority to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (viral load ≥50 copies per mL in five [1·5%] of 342 vs one [0·6%] of 171 participants) with a treatment difference of 0·9% (multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI -1·9 to 2·9). The rates of adverse events (74·6% [255 of 342 participants] vs 71·3% [122 of 171 participants]; difference 3·2 [95% CI -4·7 to 11·6]), treatment-related adverse events (10·2% [35] vs 9·4% [16]; 0·9 [-5·1 to 6·0]), serious adverse events (4·4% [15] vs 6·4% [11]; -2·0 [-7·1 to 1·9]), and discontinuations due to adverse events (2·9% [ten] vs 1·8% [three]; 1·2 [-2·3 to 3·9]) were similar in the doravirine and islatravir group and the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group, and no deaths were reported. The combination of doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) has similar efficacy and safety profiles to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, and could provide a two-drug, once daily, oral single-tablet option without an integrase strand-transfer inhibitor for adults who are virologically suppressed and want to switch to a different ART regimen.

Adults aged 18 years or older with HIV-1, who were virologically suppressed (with a viral load of HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) for at least 3 consecutive months on bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide and had no history of treatment failure or known resistance to doravirine, were eligible for the study. Participants were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule with a block size of three, to switch to oral doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) or to continue bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, once daily. Participants, investigators, study staff, and sponsor personnel were masked to study treatment; sponsor personnel directly involved in this analysis were unmasked at week 48. The primary endpoint, which was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study treatment, was the percentage of participants with a viral load of 50 copies per mL or higher at week 48 according to the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot approach; non-inferiority would be concluded if the upper bound of the multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI for the treatment difference was less than 4%. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05630755, and is ongoing but closed to enrolment."

      "abstract": "To conduct an updated systematic review of the current evidence on the implementation of the 'Atrial fibrillation Better Care' (ABC) pathway for the comprehensive and holistic management of patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF).We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies reporting the prevalence of ABC-adherent management in patients with AF and its association with clinical outcomes (all-cause death, cardiovascular death, stroke, stroke/thromboembolism (TE), and major bleeding). Random-effects models were used to pool results from individual studies; subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were also conducted.Overall, 22 studies were included (including 2 randomised trials), with >380,000 AF patients. Adherence to the ABC pathway was 23.9% (95%CI: 17.5%-31.7%), with substantial between-study heterogeneity (I: 99.8%). Adherence was higher in European cohorts (37.9%, 95%CI: 27.8%-49.2%) and increased with advancing age. ABC pathway adherence was associated with a lower risk of all-cause death (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.49, 95%CI: 0.41-0.58, I²: 97.1%), cardiovascular death (OR: 0.46, 95%CI: 0.36-0.59, I²: 96.4%), stroke (OR: 0.65, 95%CI: 0.51-0.82, I²: 93.5%), stroke/TE (OR: 0.53, 95%CI: 0.42-0.66, I²: 91.1%) and major bleeding (OR: 0.81, 95%CI: 0.69-0.94, I²: 89.2%). The effect of the ABC pathway was consistent in clinical trials versus real-world studies, but influenced by study-level characteristics, including geographical location, mean age, prevalence of comorbidities, and the inclusion of estimates adjusted for potential confounders.Adherence to the ABC pathway remains suboptimal in patients with AF, but is associated with substantial beneficial effects on prognosis. Our data support widespread implementation of the ABC pathway for managing patients with AF.",

Two multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3 studies (KALOS and LOGOS) recruited participants aged 12-80 years with inadequately-controlled asthma despite daily medium-dose or high-dose ICS-LABA use from across 378 sites in 20 countries (KALOS), and 324 sites in 15 countries (LOGOS). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to BGF 320 μg, 28·8 μg, 10 μg (BGF 28·8); BGF 320 μg, 14·4 μg, 10 μg (BGF 14·4); BFF 320 μg, 10 μg; or BFF 320 μg, 9 μg, twice a day via pressurised metered-dose inhaler for 24-52 weeks. Primary lung function endpoints were change from baseline in FEV area under the curve from 0 h to 3 h (AUC) and in morning pre-dose trough FEV from day 1 to week 24 (over 24 weeks; depending on regional health authority guidance). The primary pooled analysis across both studies was annualised severe exacerbations. The efficacy analysis set and safety set included all randomly assigned participants receiving any amount of study treatment but were analysed according to randomly assigned treatment and received treatment, respectively. The KALOS and LOGOS studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04609878 and NCT04609904, respectively) and are complete. Between Dec 15, 2020, and March 21, 2025 (KALOS), and between March 1, 2021, and March 20, 2025 (LOGOS), 8820 participants were recruited and 4311 received treatment (1179 received BGF 28·8, 726 received BGF 14·4, 1210 received BFF, and 1196 received BFF). In each study, the pre-specified multiplicity-adjusted primary endpoints for all regulatory comparisons were met. Least squares mean differences favoured BGF 28·8 for change from baseline in trough FEV and FEV AUC across all comparisons (all p<0·05). Least squares mean differences in change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV and in FEV AUC over 24 weeks for BGF 28·8 versus BFF were 76 mL (95% CI 57-94; p<0·0001) and 90 mL (72-108; p<0·0001), respectively. BGF 28·8 reduced severe exacerbation rates versus BFF (incidence rate ratio 0·86, 95% CI 0·76-0·97; p=0·012) and versus BFF (0·82, 0·71-0·94; p=0·0043). Exacerbation rate ratio for BGF 28·8 versus BFF was 0·90 (95% CI 0·78-1·03; p=0·12). 627 (53·2%) adverse events were observed with BGF 28·8, 436 (60·0%) with BGF 14·4, 666 (55·2%) with BFF, and 698 (58·4%) with BFF. No deaths were treatment related. These findings show that BGF improves lung function and reduces severe exacerbation rates in a broad population with asthma inadequately controlled despite medium-dose or high-dose ICS-LABA use. Given that these findings were observed regardless of recent exacerbation history, BGF could benefit individuals with inadequately controlled asthma without requiring a recent episode of acute deterioration on ICS-LABA before escalation.

We aimed to assess whether intravenous tenecteplase administered within 24 h after symptom onset improved functional outcome compared with standard medical treatment in patients with basilar artery occlusion. TRACE-5 was a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint, superiority, phase 3 trial conducted at 66 stroke centres in China. We included patients aged 18 years or older with stroke due to basilar artery occlusion who were eligible for intravenous thrombolytics within 24 h of stroke onset or the time they were last known to be well and had a pre-stroke modified Rankin scale (mRS) score of 3 or less (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability). Patients were randomly assigned to receive a single intravenous bolus of tenecteplase (0·25 mg/kg; maximum 25 mg) within 24 h after symptom onset or standard medical treatment (which could include intravenous alteplase at 0·9 mg/kg, maximum 90 mg, within 4·5 h of symptom onset; anticoagulation; or antiplatelets), with or without endovascular thrombectomy. The primary outcome was a score of 0-1 on the mRS or return to the baseline mRS score (if the baseline pre-stroke mRS score was 2-3) at 90 days. Safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage and death. The primary outcome and safety outcomes were assessed in all randomly assigned participants included in their originally assigned groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06196320. Between Jan 24, 2024, and June 20, 2025, 452 patients were enrolled (mean age 66·4 years [SD 11·2], 321 [71%] males, and 131 [29%] females), of whom 222 (49%) subsequently underwent thrombectomy; 221 were randomly assigned to receive tenecteplase and 231 to receive standard medical treatment. Alteplase was used in 80 (35%) of the patients in the standard medical treatment group. An mRS score of 0-1 or return to the baseline mRS score occurred in 83 (38%) patients in the tenecteplase group and 66 (29%) patients in the standard medical treatment group (adjusted relative rate 1·50 [95% CI 1·09-2·08], p=0·014). Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within 36 h occurred in four (2%) patients in the tenecteplase group and seven (3%) patients in the standard medical treatment group (adjusted relative rate 0·58 [95% CI 0·17-1·99]). All-cause mortality at 90 days was similar between groups (65 [29%] patients in the tenecteplase group and 71 [31%] patients in the standard medical treatment group; adjusted relative rate 0·87 [95% CI 0·62-1·22]), as was the proportion of patients with an mRS score of 5-6 at 90 days (82 [37%] vs 89 [39%]; 0·87 [0·65-1·18]).

This randomized, open-label, blinded end-point clinical trial was conducted at 48 centers in China. A total of 566 patients with non-large vessel occlusion stroke and evidence of potentially salvageable tissue determined on perfusion imaging presenting within 4.5 to 24 hours of the time last seen well were recruited between June 2, 2023, and August 4, 2025 (final follow-up, October 28, 2025). Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 using a minimization algorithm to receive intravenous tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg; maximum dose, 25 mg; n = 282) or standard medical treatment (n = 284). The primary efficacy outcome was an excellent functional outcome, defined as a score of 0 or 1 on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. Safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours and mortality within 90 days. Among the 570 patients randomized, 566 were included in the primary analysis (median age, 68 [IQR, 59-75] years; 196 female [34.6%]).

Among patients with non-large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke and salvageable brain tissue, intravenous tenecteplase administered 4.5 to 24 hours after onset resulted in a greater likelihood of an excellent functional outcome at 90 days than standard care but had an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

For patients without ST-segment elevation after return of spontaneous circulation, the COACT (Coronary Angiography After Cardiac Arrest) trial was the first randomized trial that investigated the benefit of immediate vs delayed coronary angiography with subsequent percutaneous coronary intervention if needed. No difference in 90-day survival was found. The long-term impact on survival of the 2 treatment strategies remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate the 5-year impact on survival of immediate vs delayed coronary angiography in OHCA patients with an initial shockable rhythm and no ST-segment elevation on initial electrocardiography after return of spontaneous circulation. The COACT trial was a randomized, open-label, multicenter study comparing immediate vs delayed coronary angiography in patients resuscitated from OHCA without ST-segment elevation. Nineteen Dutch centers enrolled patients, and 5-year follow-up was obtained via structured telephone interviews. Secondary endpoints included myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, heart failure-related hospitalizations, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks. At 5-year follow-up, data from 514 of 552 patients (93.1%) were available. Of these patients, 261 (50.8%) were assigned to immediate angiography and 253 (49.2%) to a delayed strategy. Baseline characteristics were similar across the 2 treatment groups. Five years after the index hospitalization, 143 patients (54.8%) were alive in the immediate angiography group, and 131 patients (51.8%) were alive in the delayed angiography group (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.74-1.23; log-rank P = 072). In a nonprespecified and exploratory landmark analysis, HRs for death to 90 days and >90 days were 1.11 (95% CI: 0.84-1.49; log-rank P = 0.46) and 0.56 (95% CI: 0.32-0.97; log-rank P = 0.04). Rates of myocardial infarction, heart failure-related hospitalization, and revascularization were low and did not differ between groups. At 5 years, survival was comparable between immediate and delayed angiography, with no clear benefit or harm. A late survival benefit appeared after 90 days, though its clinical significance remains uncertain and most likely is due to chance. (Coronary Angiography After Cardiac Arrest [COACT]; NTR4973).",

      "abstract": "Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a highly prevalent disease associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The most recently introduced osteoporosis medication is romosozumab, a monoclonal antibody with a unique mechanism of action that increases bone mineral density (BMD) more than other agents by both stimulating new bone formation and inhibiting resorption. The drug's stimulation of bone formation, however, wanes after several months. The use of romosozumab is limited by cost, the inconvenience of monthly clinic-administered injections, and its cardiovascular risk profile. In this trial, we aimed to test the hypothesis that a shorter course of romosozumab might be equally effective as the standard regimen. We did a 12-month, prospective, open-label, randomised, controlled, non-inferiority trial of 50 postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture. The study was done at a single academic medical centre in the USA. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 3 months of romosozumab (210 mg by subcutaneous injection, monthly) followed by 9 months of denosumab (60 mg by subcutaneous injection, every 6 months; 3-month ROMO group) or 12 months of romosozumab (12-month ROMO group). The primary endpoint was the percentage change in total hip BMD. The non-inferiority threshold was set at 2%. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05010590. Between March 2, 2022, and May 2, 2023, we screened 188 participants. Of those, 102 (54%) were ineligible and 36 (19%) declined to participate. We randomly assigned 50 participants to either the 3-month ROMO group (24 [48%] participants) or the 12-month ROMO group (26 [52%] participants). Study participants completing at least one post-baseline visit were included in the analysis (modified intention-to-treat analysis). The mean age of participants was 69·6 years (SD 4·5). The mean 12-month change in total hip BMD was 5·7% (SD 3·3) in the 3-month romosozumab group and 6·0% (3·2) in the 12-month romosozumab group, meeting the prespecified non-inferiority threshold. Adverse events (back pain, cough, fatigue, headache, joint pain, muscle cramps, muscle pain, palpitations, paraesthesia, reaction at injection site, rhinorrhoea, skin rash, and swelling) were balanced between groups. In postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture, 3 months of romosozumab followed by 9 months of denosumab was non-inferior to 12 months of romosozumab in increasing total hip BMD. Given the expense, injection burden, and potential adverse effects of romosozumab, this abbreviated approach could broaden access to this uniquely effective therapy.

      "abstract": "The proportion of US adolescents experiencing mental health or substance use disorders continues to rise. Pediatricians are expected to deliver evidence-based screening and counseling, but multiple barriers impede implementation. This systematic review assessed the effectiveness of implementation strategies-activities to enhance implementation, service, and health outcomes-to support integration of screening and counseling for mental health and substance use disorders (MHSUD) into primary care for children and adolescents. We searched multiple databases for literature published since 2010. Eligible studies compared any strategy to support implementation of a recommended intervention to prevent MHSUD among individuals aged 18 years or younger in primary care with another strategy or no strategy. We extracted data on study designs, populations, settings, clinical interventions, barriers and facilitators to implementation, implementation interventions and comparators, and results. Eleven studies focused on implementing screening and counseling for depression, eating disorders, substance use disorders, and general behavioral health risk factors. Implementation approaches were multifaceted and consisted of incorporating behavioral health providers into primary care, facilitating learning collaboratives, providing support to clinicians, and using technology. These approaches generally resulted in increased screening, taking steps to address a positive screen, and initiation of treatment compared with using only minimal or no strategy.

Similarly, the negative likelihood ratios for mortality ranged from 0.06 (sPESI) to 0.95 (modified FAST). The weighted net benefit was highest for the sPESI (35.9%) and lowest for the SI (-187.6%).

Prospective cohort study. Secondary care in 23 hospitals in the UK between June 2015 and March 2023. Premenopausal women presenting with non-specific symptoms, and raised serum levels of cancer antigen 125 or abnormal imaging results, were prospectively recruited, predominantly referred through the NHS urgent suspected cancer pathway from primary care. A head-to-head comparison of the accuracy of the six risk prediction models and scores was conducted using donated blood and ultrasound scans performed by NHS staff trained in the use of International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) imaging terminology. The index tests used were Risk of Malignancy Index 1 (with pre-stated thresholds of 200, 250), Risk of Malignancy Algorithm (7.4%, 11.4%, 12.5%, 13.1%), IOTA Assessment of Different Neoplasias in the adnEXa (ADNEX) (3%, 10%), IOTA simple rules risk model (3%, 10%), IOTA simple rules, and cancer antigen 125 (CA 125, 87 IU/mL). Participants were classified as having primary invasive ovarian cancer versus having benign or normal pathology according to the reference standard determined from surgical specimens or biopsies by histology or cytology, if undertaken, or else at 12 month follow-up. After June 2018, because of covid restrictions and concerns about sample size, recruitment was restricted to only women undergoing surgery within three months of presentation to clinic (in whom ovarian cancer was more likely). Diagnostic accuracy at predicting primary invasive ovarian cancer versus benign or normal histology, assessed by analysing the sensitivity, specificity, C index, area under receiver operating characteristic curve, positive and negative predictive values, and calibration plots in participants with conclusive reference standard results and available index test data. 88 of 1211 premenopausal women received diagnoses of primary ovarian cancer: 49 of 857 women in the pre-June 2018 cohort (prevalence of 5.7%) and 39 of 354 women in the post-June 2018 cohort (11.0%). For the diagnosis of primary ovarian cancer (n=799 women, after exclusion of 58 other diagnoses), Risk of Malignancy Index 1 at the 250 threshold had a sensitivity of 42.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 28.3 to 57.8; specificity 96.5%, 94.7 to 97.8). Compared with Risk of Malignancy Index 1 at the 250 threshold, CA 125 and all other tests had higher sensitivity (CA 125 at 87 IU/mL threshold: 55.1%, 40.2 to 69.3, P=0.06; Risk of Malignancy Algorithm at 11.4% threshold: 79.2%, 65.0 to 89.5, P<0.001; IOTA ADNEX at 10% threshold: 89.1%, 76.4 to 96.4, P<0.001; IOTA simple rules risk at 10% threshold: 83.0%, 69.2 to 92.4, P<0.001; IOTA simple rules: 75.0%, 56.6 to 88.5, P=0.01) and lower specificity (CA 125 at 87 IU/mL threshold: 89.0%, 86.5 to 91.2, P<0.001; Risk of Malignancy Algorithm at 11.4% threshold: 73.1%, 69.6 to 76.3, P<0.001; IOTA ADNEX at 10% threshold: 75.1%, 71.4 to 78.6, P<0.001; IOTA simple rules risk at 10% threshold: 76.0%, 72.4 to 79.3, P<0.001; IOTA simple rules: 95.2%, 93.0 to 96.9, P=0.06). Results for IOTA simple rules were inconclusive in 120 of 799 participants. Analysis of the complete cohort (n=1211), including the 354 premenopausal women with a higher likelihood of developing ovarian cancer, yielded similar results. Compared to Risk of Malignancy Index 1 at 250 threshold-the test currently used in NHS secondary care to triage women to tertiary care-most tests improve sensitivity but reduce specificity. Ultrasound triage with the IOTA ADNEX model at 10% in secondary care demonstrated the highest sensitivity gain, with a comparable decline in specificity to other comparator tests. Ultrasound with the IOTA ADNEX model at 10% should be considered the new standard of care test for triaging premenopausal women in secondary care.

Obstetric guidelines advocate for first-line treatment of moderate iron deficiency anemia with twice-daily oral iron; however, rates of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy remain above global targets and are rising. Determine whether single-dose intravenous iron for primary treatment of maternal iron deficiency anemia in the second trimester is superior to twice daily oral iron in reducing incidence of low birth weight infants and maternal anemia at delivery. This is a parallel, 3-arm, semiblind superiority randomized controlled multicenter trial across 4 sites in India from March 15, 2021-May 12, 2023. Participants were singleton pregnancies at 14 to 17 weeks with moderate iron deficiency anemia (hemoglobin 7.0-9.9 g/dL) who were randomized 1:1:1 to (1) 60 mg oral ferrous sulfate twice daily; or single-dose infusion of (2) intravenous ferric derisomaltose or (3) intravenous ferric carboxymaltose. Two intravenous arms were selected as these are the only 2 intravenous iron formulations publicly available in India. All participants received folic acid supplementation throughout pregnancy and antihelminthic therapy, as recommended by national guidelines. The dual primary outcomes were: (1) low birth weight (<2500 grams) and (2) attainment of a maternal nonanemic state (hemoglobin ≥11.0 g/dL at 30-34 weeks or delivery) for each intravenous iron arm vs oral iron; intravenous iron arms were not compared to each other. Secondary outcomes included safety measures, and other maternal and infant outcomes. Participants with hemoglobin <7 g/dL or <1 g/dL improvement on therapy received rescue treatment with intravenous iron or blood transfusion as determined by their provider. Sensitivity analyses included defining nonanemic state as achieving hemoglobin ≥11.0 without need for additional IV iron or transfusion. Comparison of each intravenous iron arm to oral iron was conducted with a 2-sided alpha set at 0.0005 for achieving nonanemic state and 0.0245 for low birth weight for each intravenous iron arm using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test stratified by enrollment site. The oral iron, ferric derisomaltose, and ferric carboxymaltose arms included 1450, 1456, and 1462 participants respectively. There was a reduced rate of low birth weight with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (25·2%, relative risk 0·87 [97·55% confidence interval 0.75, 0.99], P=.017), but not intravenous ferric derisomaltose (29.1%, relative risk 0.98 [97.55% confidence interval 0.86, 1.12], P=.71) vs oral iron (29.3%). Achievement of nonanemic state was not improved: intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (relative risk 1.05 [99.95% confidence interval 0.97-1.15]) and intravenous ferric derisomaltose (relative risk 1.06 [99.95% confidence interval 0.98, 1.16]) vs oral (69.7%). In sensitivity analysis, there was increased rate of achieving nonanemic state without use of additional IV iron or transfusion in both intravenous ferric derisomaltose (relative risk 1.25 (1.13-1.396), P<.0001) and intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (relative risk 1.24 (1.12-1.38), P<.0001) vs oral iron. First-line treatment of moderate maternal iron deficiency anemia with single-dose infusion of intravenous iron results in a reduced incidence of low birth weight infants (intravenous ferric carboxymaltose vs oral) and a higher incidence of attaining maternal nonanemic state without use of additional iron or blood transfusion (intravenous ferric carboxymaltose and ferric derisomaltose vs oral). Clinical guidelines should address the potential benefit of single-dose intravenous iron as the primary treatment of moderate iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy.",

Sonography is an ideal first-line imaging modality to assess for effusion, and recent literature suggests that point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) performed by emergency providers can be safely and accurately performed at the bedside. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to summarize the diagnostic accuracy of POCUS for pediatric hip effusion. MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central databases were searched through July 2025, with no date limits, using pre-defined criteria for articles assessing the diagnostic accuracy of POCUS for pediatric hip effusion. Data were extracted and quality assessment was performed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Test characteristics were pooled using a bivariate mixed effects model for meta-analysis. Four studies, with a total of 526 hips scanned, met our inclusion criteria. The reference standard for all included studies was radiology-performed ultrasonography. POCUS demonstrated a pooled sensitivity of 88% (95% CI, 82%-92%), specificity of 97% (95% CI, 93%-99%), positive likelihood ratio of 35 (95% CI, 12.0-100.8), and negative likelihood ratio of 0.13 (0.08-0.19). POCUS has high specificity and moderate sensitivity for hip effusion in children and is a valuable first-line diagnostic tool for evaluating children with hip pain, limp and inability to bear weight in emergency and acute care settings.",

      "abstract": "Induction of labour (IoL) aims to initiate labour when the risks of continuing pregnancy outweigh the benefits. Over 10 methods are currently available, yet the most effective and safest method remains unclear. To compare the benefits and harms of various cervical ripening and IoL methods at or beyond term labour and to rank the methods. We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP until 1 February 2023. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating IoL methods among women with a live fetus at or beyond term labour (gestational age ≥ 37 weeks). We focused on the methods currently recommended by international guidelines and those proposed by previous Cochrane reviews. Our critical outcomes included failure to achieve vaginal delivery within 24 hours, caesarean section due to any causes, caesarean section due to non-reassuring fetal status, uterine hyperstimulation with changes in the heartbeat of the baby before birth, perinatal death, and severe neonatal morbidity. We assessed bias and trustworthiness using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool and the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Trustworthiness Tool (CPS-TST), respectively. The final analyses only included trials that met the CPS-TST. We performed pair-wise meta-analyses using a random-effects model and network meta-analyses (NMA) with a frequentist approach. We reported analyses and results separately for two populations: 1) women without a previous caesarean section and a mix of women with or without a previous caesarean section (where more than 50% of participants had no previous caesarean section), and 2) women with a previous caesarean section. We used risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) to present treatment effects with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence for critical outcomes using the GRADE approach for NMA. We used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to estimate treatment ranking. The analysis included 106 RCTs assessing 13 IoL methods among 30,348 women. Most trials (84.9%) were conducted in inpatient settings. Only two RCTs recruited women with previous caesarean section, and seven RCTs recruited a mix of women with or without a previous caesarean section. We evaluated the effects of the following IoL methods: vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg), oral misoprostol (≤ 50 μg), sublingual or buccal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg), controlled-release misoprostol vaginal pessary, vaginal dinoprostone (tablet or gel), controlled-release dinoprostone vaginal pessary, oxytocin (alone), nitric oxide donors, balloon catheters, osmotic cervical dilators, oxytocin plus amniotomy (Oxytocin+Amniotomy), balloon catheters plus oxytocin (Balloon+Oxytocin), balloon catheters plus vaginal/oral misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) (Balloon+Misoprostol ≤ 50 μg), and inactive methods (placebo, no intervention, and expectant management). The following results show the relative effects of NMA for four of the six critical outcomes among women without previous caesarean section and a mix of women with or without previous caesarean section. The findings of women with previous caesarean section are not presented here due to limited evidence. We used vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) as the reference method for presenting results, where data for this method were available in the network. 1) Failure to achieve vaginal delivery within 24 hours There was no clear evidence that any of the methods were more effective than vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) in reducing the risk of this outcome. Oxytocin+Amniotomy (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.24, 22.4% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence), Balloon+Misoprostol ≤ 50 μg (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.19, 5.7% fewer, high-certainty evidence), and Balloon+Oxytocin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.26, 2.3% fewer, low-certainty evidence) likely resulted in little to no difference in this outcome compared with vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg). Despite the comparable relative treatment effects between some methods and vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg), these three methods ranked highest. 2) Caesarean section due to non-reassuring fetal status There was no clear evidence that any of the methods were more effective than vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) in reducing the risk of this outcome. Balloon+Oxytocin (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.25, 2.0% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence), controlled-release dinoprostone vaginal pessary (RR 0.86, 0.62 to 1.18, 1.2% fewer, low-certainty evidence), and balloon catheters (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.11, 1.0% fewer, low-certainty evidence) may result in little to no difference in this outcome when compared with vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg). Despite the comparable relative treatment effects between all methods and vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg), these three methods ranked highest. 3) Uterine hyperstimulation with changes in the heartbeat of the baby before birth Nitric oxide donors (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.47, 3.9% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence), osmotic cervical dilators (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.42, 3.8% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence), balloon catheters (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.69, 2.5% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence), and oral misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.99, 1.6% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence) probably reduce this outcome compared with vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg). When compared with inactive interventions (placebo, no intervention, or expectant management), vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.16 to 10.35) probably increases the risk of this outcome. The three highest-ranked methods were nitric oxide donors, osmotic cervical dilators, and inactive methods (placebo, no intervention, and expectant management). 4) Perinatal death There was no clear evidence for this outcome, as it was rare (10 cases reported across trials). For women without previous caesarean section and a mix of women with or without previous caesarean section, there was no clear evidence that any of the IoL methods were more effective than vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) for the outcomes of failure to achieve vaginal delivery within 24 hours, caesarean section due to non-reassuring fetal status, and perinatal death. Nitric oxide donors, osmotic cervical dilators, balloon catheters, and oral misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) probably reduce the risk of uterine hyperstimulation with changes in the heartbeat of the baby before birth.

We aimed to compare the interval cancer rate in AI-supported mammography screening with standard double reading without AI. In this Swedish randomised, controlled, non-inferiority, single-blinded, population-based screening accuracy trial, participants were allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either AI-supported mammography screening (the intervention group) or standard double reading without AI (the control group). AI was used to triage examinations to single or double reading by radiologists and for detection support. This is a protocol-defined analysis of the primary outcome, interval cancer rate, with a 20% non-inferiority margin. Secondary outcomes reported in this analysis are interval cancer characteristics, sensitivity, specificity, and sensitivity by age, breast density, and cancer type (in-situ and invasive). Other secondary outcomes from the trial that have been previously reported are referenced in the Methods section of this Article. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04838756) and is complete. Between April 12, 2021, and Dec 7, 2022, 105 934 women were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group, of whom 19 were excluded from the analysis. Median age was 53·8 years (IQR 46·5-63·3) in the intervention group and 53·7 years (46·5-63·2) in the control group. Interval cancer rates were 1·55 (95% CI 1·23-1·92) and 1·76 (1·42-2·15) per 1000 participants in the intervention and control group respectively, a non-inferior proportion ratio of 0·88 (95% CI 0·65-1·18; p=0·41). Descriptively, the intervention group had fewer interval cancers that were invasive (75 vs 89), T2+ (38 vs 48), or non-luminal A (43 vs 59) than the control group. Sensitivity was higher in the intervention group (80·5% [95% CI 76·4-84·2]) than the control group (73·8% [68·9-78·3]; p=0·031), an effect consistent across age and breast density, and for invasive cancer but not for in-situ cancer. Specificity was 98·5% (95% CI 98·4-98·6) for both groups (p=0·88). AI-supported mammography screening showed consistently favourable outcomes compared with standard double reading, with a non-inferior interval cancer rate, fewer interval cancers with unfavourable characteristics, higher sensitivity, and the same specificity, while also reducing screen reading workload. These findings imply that AI-supported mammography screening can efficiently improve screening performance compared with standard double reading and may be considered for implementation in clinical practice.

      "abstract": "Patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure decreases recurrent stroke but increases atrial fibrillation (AF). Careful selection of patients in whom PFO is more likely to be the cause of stroke may improve outcomes by avoiding closure in patients unlikely to benefit. To determine whether the PFO-Associated Stroke Causal Likelihood (PASCAL) classification system identifies who will experience net benefit and net harm from PFO closure. This meta-analysis was a secondary analysis of individual participant-level data from the Systematic, Collaborative, PFO Closure Evaluation (SCOPE) consortium meta-analysis, including all 6 randomized trials of transcatheter PFO closure vs antithrombotic therapy alone. Participants were young and middle-aged adults (mean [SD] age, 45 [10] years) with a PFO and an otherwise cryptogenic stroke. The trials were conducted in hospitals in North America, Europe, Australia, Brazil, and South Korea from 2000 to 2017. The current analysis, involving all trial participants, was performed from January to August 2025. Transcatheter PFO closure plus antithrombotic therapy vs antithrombotic therapy alone. The primary efficacy end point was recurrent ischemic stroke. The primary safety end point was first-ever detection of AF beyond the periprocedural period (>45 days after randomization). The 6 trials enrolled 3740 patients (1889 who had PFO closure, 1851 who had medical therapy); 2058 patients (55.0%) were male, and 1682 (45.0%) were female. Among patients in all 6 trials, PASCAL classified PFO relatedness to the index stroke as probable in 1382 patients (37.0%), possible in 1811 (48.4%), and unlikely in 547 (14.6%); among the 2967 patients in the 4 trials with broad entry criteria, PASCAL classified PFO relatedness as probable in 860 patients (29.0%), possible in 1565 (52.7%), and unlikely in 543 (18.3%). The reduction in the absolute rate of recurrent ischemic strokes over 5 years was greater than the increase in first-ever detection of AF in the postperiprocedural period as follows: in the probable group, fewer strokes, -2.5% (95% CI, -4.2% to -1.3%) vs more late AF, 1.3% (95% CI, 0.0% to 2.5%), and in the possible group, fewer strokes -3.4% (95% CI, -5.4% to -1.3%) vs more late AF, 1.1% (95% CI, -0.5% to 2.6%). Reduction in recurrent ischemic strokes was not observed and increase in first-ever detected postperiprocedural AF was magnified in the unlikely group (more strokes, 0.4%; 95% CI, -4.0% to 4.8%, vs more late AF, 4.6%; 95% CI, 0.3% to 8.9%). Among young and middle-aged patients with PFO and otherwise cryptogenic stroke, the PASCAL classification algorithm distinguished the 4 of every 5 patients in the probable and possible groups with net benefit and the 1 of every 5 patients in the unlikely group with net harm from closure.",
