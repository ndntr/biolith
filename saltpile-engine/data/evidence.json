      "abstract": "Whether potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy without aspirin initiated shortly after successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is effective and safe for patients with acute coronary syndromes is unclear. We conducted a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in Brazil involving patients with acute coronary syndromes who had undergone successful PCI. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio within the first 4 days of hospitalization to stop treatment with aspirin and receive potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (ticagrelor or prasugrel) or to receive dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and a potent P2Y12 inhibitor) for 12 months. The two ranked primary outcomes, assessed through 12 months, were a composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or urgent target-vessel revascularization (tested for noninferiority, with a noninferiority margin of 2.5 percentage points) and major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (tested for superiority). A total of 3410 patients were included in the intention-to-treat population (1712 in the monotherapy group and 1698 in the dual antiplatelet therapy group). At 12 months, death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or urgent revascularization had occurred in 119 patients (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 7.0%) in the monotherapy group and in 93 patients (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 5.5%) in the dual antiplatelet therapy group (absolute risk difference, 1.47 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.16 to 3.10; P = 0.11 for noninferiority). Major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding had occurred in 33 patients (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 2.0%) in the monotherapy group and in 82 patients (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 4.9%) in the dual antiplatelet therapy group (absolute risk difference, -2.97 percentage points; 95% CI, -4.20 to -1.73). Stent thrombosis occurred in 12 patients in the monotherapy group and in 4 in the dual antiplatelet therapy group. Among patients who had undergone successful PCI for acute coronary syndromes, potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy was not found to be noninferior to dual antiplatelet therapy with respect to a composite of death or ischemic events at 12 months.

      "abstract": "Hypokalemia and even low-normal plasma potassium levels increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias among patients with cardiovascular disease. An assessment of a strategy of actively increasing plasma potassium levels to the high-normal range is needed. In this multicenter, open-label, event-driven, randomized superiority trial conducted in Denmark, we enrolled participants at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias (defined as those with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [ICD]) and with a baseline plasma potassium level of 4.3 mmol per liter or lower. Participants were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to a treatment regimen aimed at increasing the plasma potassium level to a high-normal level (4.5 to 5.0 mmol per liter) by means of potassium supplementation, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, or both plus dietary guidance and standard care (high-normal potassium group) or to standard care only (standard-care group). The primary end point was a composite of documented sustained ventricular tachycardia or appropriate ICD therapy, unplanned hospitalization (>24 hours) for arrhythmia or heart failure, or death from any cause, assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis. Among the 1200 participants who underwent randomization (600 assigned to each group), the median duration of follow-up was 39.6 months (interquartile range, 26.4 to 49.3). A primary end-point event occurred in 136 participants (22.7%; 7.3 events per 100 person-years) in the high-normal potassium group, as compared with 175 participants (29.2%; 9.6 events per 100 person-years) in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.95; P = 0.01). The incidence of hospitalization for hyperkalemia or hypokalemia was similar in the two groups. Among participants with any cardiovascular disease who had an ICD and were at high risk for ventricular arrhythmias, a treatment-induced increase in plasma potassium levels led to a significantly lower risk of appropriate ICD therapy, unplanned hospitalization for arrhythmia or heart failure, or death from any cause than standard care.

      "abstract": "Approved spinal muscular atrophy therapies greatly improve clinical outcomes; however, substantial motor function deficits persist. Apitegromab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, selectively inhibits myostatin activation, improving muscle function. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of apitegromab in patients with nonambulatory type 2 or type 3 spinal muscular atrophy receiving nusinersen or risdiplam. SAPPHIRE, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, was done in 48 hospitals in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA. Eligible participants were aged 2-21 years, had genetically documented SMN-deficient nonambulatory type 2 or type 3 spinal muscular atrophy, an estimated life expectancy greater than 2 years, Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE) scores 10-45, and had received at least 10 months' nusinersen or at least 6 months' risdiplam therapy at screening. Participants aged 2-12 years were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive apitegromab 20 mg/kg, apitegromab 10 mg/kg, or placebo every 4 weeks; participants aged 13-21 years were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive apitegromab 20 mg/kg or placebo every 4 weeks. All participants, parents or caregivers, investigators, and site personnel were unaware of the treatment assignment. The primary endpoint, change from baseline in HFMSE at 12 months, was assessed in participants aged 2-12 years who received at least one dose of apitegromab or placebo and had at least one post-baseline evaluable HFMSE assessment (modified intention-to-treat set). Comparisons of the combined apitegromab dose (20 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) versus placebo and the 20 mg/kg dose versus placebo were done with a mixed-effects model with repeated measurement. Safety was analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of apitegromab or placebo through evaluation of adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs and cardiac assessments, laboratory evaluations, and concomitant medications. SAPPHIRE is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05156320, and is completed. From March 28, 2022, to Sept 4, 2024, we enrolled 188 patients (156 in the population aged 2-12 years and 32 in the population aged 13-21 years); of whom 128 participants received apitegromab and 60 participants received placebo. At 12 months, least squares mean difference in HFMSE change from baseline was 1·8 (95% CI 0·30 to 3·32, p=0·019) points for participants aged 2-12 years receiving apitegromab versus placebo (least squares mean 0·6 vs -1·2). Least squares mean difference in HFMSE change from baseline was 1·4 (95% CI -0·34 to 3·13; p=0·11) for apitegromab 20 mg/kg versus placebo (least squares mean 0·2 vs -1·2). The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar between apitegromab and placebo, and consistent with spinal muscular atrophy and background spinal muscular atrophy therapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were pyrexia (apitegromab, 33 [26%] of 128 vs placebo, 17 [28%] of 60), nasopharyngitis (32 [25%] vs 14 [23%]), cough (30 [23%] vs 12 [20%]), vomiting (29 [23%] vs ten [17%]), upper respiratory tract infection (28 [22%] vs 18 [30%]), and headache (27 [21%] vs 12 [20%]). No patients discontinued due to adverse events. Participants in the apitegromab treatment groups (combined 20 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose) achieved statistically significant improvements in motor function compared with placebo; however, the least squares mean difference was not significant between apitegromab 20 mg/kg and placebo. Overall, SAPPHIRE results build on findings from the phase 2 TOPAZ trial, showing improved motor function with a generally well tolerated safety profile, supporting the use of muscle-targeting therapy for spinal muscular atrophy.

A randomized clinical trial including 840 adult patients (aged 19-80 years) who were enrolled and randomized from July 28, 2020, to March 9, 2023, at 18 hospitals in South Korea. Enrolled patients had at least 1 non-sex-related stroke risk factor (determined using the CHA2DS2-VASc score [range, 0-9]) and no documented recurrence of atrial arrhythmia for at least 1 year after catheter ablation for AF. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is used as an assessment of stroke risk among patients with AF (calculated using point values for congestive heart failure, hypertension, ≥75 years of age, diabetes, stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, between 65 and 74 years of age, and sex category). The date of final follow-up was June 4, 2025. The patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to discontinue oral anticoagulant therapy (n = 417) or continue oral anticoagulant therapy (with direct oral anticoagulants; n = 423). The primary outcome was the first occurrence of a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, and major bleeding at 2 years. Individual components of the primary outcome (such as ischemic stroke and major bleeding) were assessed as secondary outcomes. Of the 840 adults randomized, the mean age was 64 (SD, 8) years, 24.9% were women, the mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was 2.1 (SD, 1.0), and 67.6% had paroxysmal AF.

The 2-year cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke was 0.3% in the discontinue oral anticoagulant therapy group vs 0.8% in the continue oral anticoagulant therapy group (absolute difference, -0.5 percentage points [95% CI, -1.6 to 0.6]). Major bleeding occurred in 0 patients in the discontinue oral anticoagulant therapy group vs 5 patients (1.4%) in the continue oral anticoagulant therapy group (absolute difference, -1.4 percentage points [95% CI, -2.6 to -0.2]).

      "abstract": "Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE) is a significant cause of emergency department (ED) visits due to dyspnea. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is currently the recommended first-line treatment for respiratory failure secondary to ACPE. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and NIV in improving respiratory rate (RR) and other clinical outcomes in adult patients presenting to the ED with ACPE. This study was conducted as a prospective, randomized, single-center, superiority trial with a 1:1 parallel-group allocation. All consecutive adult patients (≥18 years) who presented to our emergency department between July 2023 and April 2024 were screened for eligibility. Those meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy. All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, with per-protocol (PP) analyses also presented for comparison. During the study period, 1376 patients were screened, and 178 were randomized. Baseline characteristics, including initial respiratory rates-34 (IQR, 30-38) breaths/min in the HFNC group and 33.5 (IQR, 30-37) in the NIV group-were similar between groups. In both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, the change in respiratory rate at 120 min was similar across groups. No significant differences were observed in respiratory rates or their changes at 30, 60, and 120 min. Likewise, changes in other vital signs, arterial blood gas parameters, and dyspnea scores during follow-up did not differ significantly between the groups. In this study, no difference was found between HFNC and NIV in reducing the symptoms and signs of respiratory failure with oxygen-ventilation support in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Considering that HFNC provides better patient tolerability and comfort, it may be considered a viable alternative to NIV in this specific patient population.",

      "abstract": "Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are autoimmune-mediated inflammatory disorders of skeletal muscles with non-muscle involvement in some people, which carry significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment of IIM represents an area of unmet need. This review is an update of a review previously published in 2012, as new and promising data on non-targeted treatments have emerged. To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of non-targeted immunosuppressant and immunomodulatory treatments for IIM: dermatomyositis (DM, including juvenile dermatomyositis, jDM), immune-mediated necrotising myopathy (IMNM), anti-synthetase syndrome (ASS), overlap-myositis (OM) and polymyositis (PM). We also included cancer-related myositis and amyopathic dermatomyositis. On 3 February 2023, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP. We intended to check references and citations, and contact experts to identify additional studies, but lacked the resources. We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs involving participants (adults and children) with IIM according to defined criteria. We included non-targeted immunosuppressants and immunomodulatory treatments alone or in combination, compared with a placebo, no treatment or another non-targeted immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory treatment. Our two primary outcomes were improvement of function or disability and improvement of muscle strength compared with baseline. By preference, we used the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) for disability and the Manual Muscle Test-8 (MMT8) score (adults or children) for muscle strength. Other outcomes were achievement of definitions of improvement (DOI) (the International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies (IMACS) Group or the more recent total improvement scores (TIS); for children, we reported achievement of improvement defined by the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation (PRINTO)), cumulative corticosteroid dose, change in skin disease activity, serious adverse event and withdrawals for lack of benefit or adverse events. We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias, we used the domain-based Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 1). We used fixed-effect models and, when needed, random-effects models for meta-analysis. We created summary of findings tables for any comparison for which data were available but prioritised comparisons of the following with placebo, no treatment or standard care: immunoglobulin, azathioprine and methotrexate. We included other comparisons as additional tables. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We identified 16 studies (789 participants). The risk of bias in all but one study was high or unclear. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), compared to placebo, probably improves disability and muscle strength in participants with refractory IIM (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.21 (disability) and 0.78, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.13 (muscle strength); 3 RCTs, 136 participants; both moderate-certainty evidence). IVIg has a higher response rate based on American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) criteria than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.80, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.56; 1 RCT, 95 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). IVIg, compared to placebo, improves skin symptoms (Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index (CDASI) total activity score 0 to 100; higher worse) in people with refractory DM (mean difference (MD) -8.20, 95% CI -11.91 to -4.49; 1 RCT, 95 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be more serious adverse events with IVIg than with placebo (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.50 to 7.30; 2 RCTs, 144 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but little or no difference between IVIg and placebo in withdrawals for either lack of benefit or adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.24 to 4.33; 3 RCTs, 154 participants; very low-certainty evidence). For azathioprine versus placebo, one study showed little or no effect of azathioprine on improvement in muscle strength, but the evidence was very uncertain (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.43 to 4.13; 1 RCT; 16 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence was also very uncertain for cumulative steroid dose (MD 12.06 mg/kg, 95% CI -6.09 to 30.21; 1 RCT, 16 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This early study did not assess IMACS DOI or CDASI or measure function or disability. Serious adverse events and withdrawals for either lack of benefit or adverse events were not systematically reported. For methotrexate, there may be little or no improvement in adults with DM or PM in function (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale 0 to 40, higher better) (MD 1.24, 95% CI -1.60 to 4.08; 1 RCT, 27 participants; very low-certainty evidence), muscle strength (MMT scale 0 to 80, higher better) (MD -5.68, 95% CI -12.94 to 1.58; 1 RCT, 27 participants; very low-certainty evidence), achievement of IMACS DOI (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.39; 1 RCT, 27 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Cumulative steroid dose was measured, but the data could not be analysed, and change in CDASI was not measured. In children with new-onset jDM on a background therapy of prednisone, a higher proportion may achieve minimal improvement according to the PRINTO criteria with methotrexate than with placebo (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.96; 1 RCT, 93 participants; low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events may occur slightly more frequently with methotrexate (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.54 to 4.07; 2 RCTs, 124 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be fewer withdrawals for lack of benefit or adverse events with methotrexate (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.05; 3 RCTs, 151 participants; low-certainty evidence). Our review shows improvement in disability, muscle strength and skin symptoms following IVIg in people with refractory DM (for PM, these data are not reliable; other subtypes have not been investigated in RCTs). The improvements related to IVIg in DM may be clinically meaningful, but the absence of established minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for both disability and muscle strength in IIM does not facilitate interpretation. For the other agents, the small number of trials of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies is inadequate to decide whether these agents are beneficial in IIM (excluding IBM). Our review shows room for improvement in the conduct and reporting of clinical trials in IIM, as well as the need to further investigate MCIDs for important outcome measures in IIM.",

      "abstract": "Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with either skin or joints manifestations, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Despite multiple available treatments, their comparative efficacies and safety remain unclear due to the limited number of direct comparisons. We conducted a network meta-analysis to comprehensively compare systemic treatments. To compare the benefits and harms of non-targeted systemic agents, targeted synthetic agents, and biologic targeted treatments for people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis using a network meta-analysis, and to rank these treatments according to their benefits and harms. For this update of the living systematic review, we updated our searches monthly up to July 2024 in the following databases and trial registers: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP. Randomised controlled trials of systemic pharmacological treatments in adults over 18 years of age with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, compared to placebo or another active agent, irrespective of dose and duration. The critical outcomes were proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin, that is, at least Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 and proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) at induction phase (8 to 24 weeks after randomisation). We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We conducted study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and analysis in duplicate. We synthesised data using pairwise and network meta-analyses to compare treatments and rank them according to effectiveness (PASI 90 score) and acceptability (inverse of SAEs). We assessed the certainty of network meta-analysis evidence for the two critical outcomes and all comparisons using CINeMA, as very low, low, moderate, or high. We contacted study authors when data were unclear or missing. We used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to infer treatment hierarchy, from 0% (worst for effectiveness or safety) to 100% (best for effectiveness or safety). This update includes 26 new studies, taking the total number of included studies to 204, and randomised participants to 67,889 (67% men), mainly recruited from hospitals. The average age was 44.4 years, and the mean PASI score at baseline was 20.5 (range: 9.5 to 40). Most studies were placebo-controlled (56%). We assessed 26 treatments. Most (171) trials were multicentric (2 to 231 centres). Most studies (157/204) declared funding by a pharmaceutical company, and 27 studies did not report a funding source. Network meta-analysis at class level demonstrated that all interventions had a higher proportion of participants reaching PASI 90 than placebo. Anti-interleukin (IL)17 treatment showed a higher proportion of participants reaching PASI 90 compared to all the interventions. Biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha showed a higher proportion of participants reaching PASI 90 than the non-targeted systemic agents and the targeted systemic agents. For reaching PASI 90, the most effective drugs when compared to placebo were (in SUCRA rank order): infliximab (moderate-certainty evidence), xeligekimab (moderate-certainty), bimekizumab (high-certainty), ixekizumab (moderate-certainty), and risankizumab (moderate-certainty). Clinical effectiveness of these drugs was similar when compared against each other. There was evidence of a difference in favour of bimekizumab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab compared to secukinumab, brodalumab, and guselkumab in achieving PASI 90. Infliximab, anti-IL17 drugs (bimekizumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, sonelokimab, brodalumab), and anti-IL23 drugs (risankizumab and guselkumab) showed evidence of a difference in achieving PASI 90 compared to ustekinumab, tildrakizumab, three anti-TNF-alpha agents (adalimumab, certolizumab, and etanercept), and deucravacitinib. Ustekinumab was superior to certolizumab. Adalimumab, tildrakizumab, and ustekinumab were superior to etanercept, deucravacitinib, and apremilast. Ciclosporin and methotrexate were superior to apremilast for reaching PASI 90. We found no evidence of a difference between any of the interventions and the placebo for the risk of SAEs. Nevertheless, the SAEs analyses were based on a very low number of events with low-certainty evidence for most comparisons. Therefore, the findings must be viewed with caution. For PASI 90, 31% of studies (51/165) had a high risk of bias, 34% (56 studies) had some concerns, and 35% (58) had low risk. For SAEs, 57% (94/169) had a high risk of bias, 31% (53 studies) had some concerns, and 13% (22 studies) had low risk. Our review shows that, compared to placebo, the biologics infliximab, xeligekimab, bimekizumab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab were the most effective treatments for achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, with high-certainty evidence for bimekizumab and moderate-certainty evidence for infliximab, xeligekimab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab. This network meta-analysis evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes measured from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation), and is not sufficient for evaluating longer-term outcomes in this chronic disease. Moreover, we found low numbers of studies for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean 44.4 years) and high level of disease severity (PASI 20.5 at baseline) may not be typical of people seen in daily clinical practice. More randomised trials directly comparing active agents are needed, and these should include systematic subgroup analyses (sex, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, psoriatic arthritis). To provide long-term information on the safety of treatments included in this review, an evaluation of non-randomised studies is needed. Our confidence in the results for non-targeted systemic treatments is limited due to concerns regarding study conduct. Further research is warranted and may modify these findings.

          "text": "Network meta-analysis at class level demonstrated that all interventions had a higher proportion of participants reaching PASI 90 than placebo. Anti-interleukin (IL)17 treatment showed a higher proportion of participants reaching PASI 90 compared to all the interventions. Biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha showed a higher proportion of participants reaching PASI 90 than the non-targeted systemic agents and the targeted systemic agents. For reaching PASI 90, the most effective drugs when compared to placebo were (in SUCRA rank order): infliximab (moderate-certainty evidence), xeligekimab (moderate-certainty), bimekizumab (high-certainty), ixekizumab (moderate-certainty), and risankizumab (moderate-certainty). Clinical effectiveness of these drugs was similar when compared against each other. There was evidence of a difference in favour of bimekizumab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab compared to secukinumab, brodalumab, and guselkumab in achieving PASI 90. Infliximab, anti-IL17 drugs (bimekizumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, sonelokimab, brodalumab), and anti-IL23 drugs (risankizumab and guselkumab) showed evidence of a difference in achieving PASI 90 compared to ustekinumab, tildrakizumab, three anti-TNF-alpha agents (adalimumab, certolizumab, and etanercept), and deucravacitinib. Ustekinumab was superior to certolizumab. Adalimumab, tildrakizumab, and ustekinumab were superior to etanercept, deucravacitinib, and apremilast. Ciclosporin and methotrexate were superior to apremilast for reaching PASI 90. We found no evidence of a difference between any of the interventions and the placebo for the risk of SAEs. Nevertheless, the SAEs analyses were based on a very low number of events with low-certainty evidence for most comparisons. Therefore, the findings must be viewed with caution. For PASI 90, 31% of studies (51/165) had a high risk of bias, 34% (56 studies) had some concerns, and 35% (58) had low risk. For SAEs, 57% (94/169) had a high risk of bias, 31% (53 studies) had some concerns, and 13% (22 studies) had low risk."

          "text": "Our review shows that, compared to placebo, the biologics infliximab, xeligekimab, bimekizumab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab were the most effective treatments for achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, with high-certainty evidence for bimekizumab and moderate-certainty evidence for infliximab, xeligekimab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab. This network meta-analysis evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes measured from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation), and is not sufficient for evaluating longer-term outcomes in this chronic disease. Moreover, we found low numbers of studies for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean 44.4 years) and high level of disease severity (PASI 20.5 at baseline) may not be typical of people seen in daily clinical practice. More randomised trials directly comparing active agents are needed, and these should include systematic subgroup analyses (sex, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, psoriatic arthritis). To provide long-term information on the safety of treatments included in this review, an evaluation of non-randomised studies is needed. Our confidence in the results for non-targeted systemic treatments is limited due to concerns regarding study conduct. Further research is warranted and may modify these findings. Editorial note: this is a living systematic review. Living systematic reviews offer a new approach to review updating, in which the review is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the current status of this review."

We aimed to establish if spironolactone reduces heart failure and cardiovascular deaths in these patients. ACHIEVE was an international, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial done in 143 dialysis programmes in 12 countries. Patients were aged 45 years or older, or aged 18 years or older with a history of diabetes, and were receiving maintenance dialysis for kidney failure for at least 3 months at the time of recruitment. Patients who were able to tolerate and adhere to spironolactone 25 mg daily orally during an open-label run-in were randomly assigned (1:1) to continue spironolactone or matching placebo, using a central computerised block randomisation system (block sizes of 4) stratified by centre. Participants, health-care providers, and those assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular mortality or hospitalisation for heart failure analysed as time-to-event in all randomly assigned participants. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03020303. After a planned interim analysis of 75% of the expected primary outcome events, the external safety and efficacy monitoring committee recommended the trial be stopped early for futility. From Sept 19, 2017, to Oct 31, 2024, 3689 patients were screened for inclusion, 3565 of whom were enrolled in the open-label run-in phase, and 2538 were randomly assigned to spironolactone (n=1260) or placebo (n=1278). 931 (36·7%) participants were female and 1607 (63·3%) were male. Median follow-up was 1·8 years (IQR 0·85-3·35). The composite primary outcome occurred in 258 participants (10·46 events per 100 patient-years) in the spironolactone group and in 276 participants (11·33 per 100 patient-years) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·92 [95% CI 0·78-1·09]; p=0·35). Death from any cause was similar between groups (HR 0·95 [0·83-1·09]) as was hospitalisation for any cause (HR 0·96 [0·87-1·06]). Among patients receiving maintenance dialysis, spironolactone 25 mg daily orally did not reduce the composite outcome of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisation due to heart failure compared with placebo.

      "abstract": "Existing pharmacological treatments for insomnia have significant limitations. To assess the effective dose range, safety, and tolerability of the novel selective orexin-2 receptor antagonist seltorexant in insomnia disorder. This randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled, dose-finding, polysomnography study was conducted from November 2017 to April 2019 at 55 sites in 6 countries and analyzed in August 2019. The timeline for submission of this data for publication was impacted by internal strategic decision-making. Adults (aged 18-64 years) and older adults (aged 65-85 years) with insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index score ≥15) and no psychiatric comorbidity were included. Participants were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive nightly oral-seltorexant (5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg), placebo, or zolpidem (5-10 mg) for 14 days. Primary and key secondary outcomes included the dose-response relationship of night 1 latency to persistent sleep (LPS) and wake after sleep onset over the first 6 hours (WASO-6). Other secondary outcomes included night 13 LPS and WASO-6. Due to asymmetrical distributions of LPS and WASO-6 at baseline, log transformation was applied and results were expressed as back-transformed least-squares mean (LSM) ratios for comparisons between groups. Overall, 364 participants (mean [SD] age, 57.8 [12.4] years; 246 [67.6%] female) received seltorexant, 5 mg (n = 71), 10 mg (n = 74), or 20 mg (n = 71); placebo (n = 75); or zolpidem (n = 73). The night 1 dose-response relationship for LPS was significant (with trend test t statistics ≥3.99 and adjusted P values <.001 for all 4 prespecified models), with greater improvements in seltorexant, 10 mg and 20 mg, vs placebo (10 mg: LSM ratio, 0.64; 90% CI, 0.51-0.81; 20 mg: LSM ratio, 0.51; 90% CI, 0.41-0.64) and in seltorexant, 20 mg, vs zolpidem (LSM ratio, 0.71; 90% CI, 0.57-0.88). The night 1 dose-response relationship for WASO-6 was also significant, with trend test t statistics ≥3.99 and adjusted P values <.001 for all 4 prespecified models (seltorexant, 10 mg: LSM ratio, 0.68; 90% CI, 0.55-0.85; seltorexant, 20 mg: LSM ratio, 0.60; 90% CI, 0.48-0.74). Night 1 LPS and WASO-6 improvements were maintained on night 13 for seltorexant, 10 mg and 20 mg, but diminished for zolpidem. On night 13, compared with zolpidem, seltorexant, 10 mg and 20 mg, improved LPS by 30% and 28%, respectively, and seltorexant, 20 mg, improved WASO-6 by 31%. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were lower across the combined seltorexant doses (73/216 [33.8%]) relative to placebo (37/75 [49.3%]) and zolpidem (31/73 [42.5%]). Two participants experienced serious TEAEs during the double-blind phase (1 in the seltorexant, 20 mg, group and 1 in the zolpidem group). Three participants in the seltorexant, 5 mg, and 1 in the seltorexant, 20 mg, group experienced asymptomatic electrocardiogram-related TEAEs leading to discontinuation. Among participants with insomnia in this study, seltorexant, 10 mg and 20 mg, improved sleep initiation and maintenance throughout 14 days of treatment. Seltorexant was generally well tolerated.

      "abstract": "Trauma systems have become the standard of care in high-income countries, but remain uncommon in low- and middle-income countries. High-quality evidence of effectiveness is needed to advocate for the development of trauma systems in low- and middle-income countries, where the burden of injury is highest. To assess the benefits and harms of organised trauma systems and designated trauma centres compared with usual care in injured patients. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP on 16 December 2023. We also searched grey literature, checked reference lists of included studies, and contacted the authors of relevant studies. We included randomised controlled trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies comparing organised trauma systems or designated trauma centres with usual care. We planned to include patients who had had major trauma (i.e. Injury Severity Score greater than 15), but made a post-hoc decision to include patients regardless of injury severity. Studies were considered for inclusion regardless of date, language, or publication status. The critical outcomes were patient outcomes (such as mortality, survival, and recovery), and adverse effects. Important outcomes were utilisation and access to trauma care services, quality of care provided, equity, and knowledge about trauma care services. Studies only reported patient outcomes (mortality, survival); there were no reports on adverse effects, utilisation and access to services, quality of care, equity, and knowledge about trauma care services. We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool and guidance from the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) group to evaluate individual studies. Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence using GRADE. We could not perform a meta-analysis due to substantial clinical heterogeneity across studies. We re-analysed data from individual studies so they could be presented in a standardised format as relative effect, change in level, and change in slope. We summarised findings using a narrative synthesis. There were four interrupted time series studies (157,111 participants). Two studies (131,220 participants) compared organised trauma systems to usual care and two studies (25,891 participants) compared designated trauma centres to usual care. Two studies were conducted in the US, one in the UK, and one in Norway. It is very uncertain whether organised trauma systems reduce mortality compared to usual care because the certainty of the evidence was very low (2 studies, 131,220 participants). One study (20,357 participants, follow-up 6 years) reported reduced mortality with an organised trauma system intervention and a relative effect of -30% (change in level -2.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.17 to -0.86; change in slope -0.10, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.33). A second study (110,863 participants, follow-up 9 years) reported improved survival with intervention and a relative effect of 14% (change in level 0.13, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.76; an increase of 0.13 survival cases per quarter; change in slope 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.15). No studies reported data on adverse effects, utilisation and access to trauma care services, quality of care provided, equity, or knowledge about trauma care services. It is very uncertain whether designated trauma centres reduce mortality compared to usual care because the certainty of the evidence was very low (2 studies, 25,891 participants). One study (7247 participants) reported a decrease in mortality for all patients (relative effect -42%; change in level -3.60, 95% CI -11.26 to 4.07; change in slope -0.51, 95% CI -2.26 to 1.23), patients with Injury Severity Score 15 to 24 (relative effect -44%; change in level -8.80, 95% CI -29.61 to 12.00; change in slope -0.96, 95% CI -5.69 to 3.77), and patients with Injury Severity Score greater than 24 (relative effect -55%; change in level -17.87, 95% CI -47.12 to 11.37; change in slope -1.90, 95% CI -8.55 to 4.75). A second study (18,644 participants, follow-up 11 years) reported reduced mortality for adults (relative effect -67%; change in level -17.52, 95% CI -42.27 to 7.23; change in slope -2.09, 95% CI -6.22 to 2.04) and children (relative effect -84%; change in level -18.56, 95% CI -30.11 to -7.01; change in slope -1.12, 95% CI -3.04 to 0.80). No studies reported data on adverse effects, utilisation and access to trauma care services, quality of care provided, equity, or knowledge about trauma care services. The available evidence is currently insufficient to quantify the implications and impact of organised trauma systems and designated trauma centres on clinical practice. This is primarily due to a lack of studies with high methodological rigour for assessing the effects of clinical interventions, as well as the absence of reporting on important outcomes for determining their effectiveness. Future research could provide evidence by utilising observational studies with high methodological rigour when randomised trials are not feasible; and focus on collecting important outcomes such as the utilisation, access, and quality of care provided, and knowledge about trauma care services.

In this single-center, double-blind, randomized trial, adults with VTE after the occurrence of a transient provoking factor who had at least one enduring risk factor and had completed at least 3 months of anticoagulation were assigned to receive oral apixaban (at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily) or placebo for 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome was the first symptomatic recurrent VTE. The primary safety outcome was the first episode of major bleeding according to the criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis. A total of 600 patients underwent randomization (mean age, 59.5 years; female sex, 57.0%; non-White race, 19.2%). The trial population had a broad range of provoking factors and enduring risk factors. Symptomatic recurrent VTE occurred in 4 of the 300 patients (1.3%) in the apixaban group and in 30 of the 300 patients (10.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04 to 0.36; P<0.001).

One patient in the apixaban group and 3 patients in the placebo group died, with no deaths attributed to cardiovascular or hemorrhagic causes. Nonhemorrhagic, nonfatal adverse events occurred in 6 patients (2.0%) in each group.

The consortium includes representatives from India, Indonesia, South Africa, Uganda, Viet Nam, Australia, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA. Questions were developed using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) format for tuberculous meningitis diagnosis, anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy, adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy, and neurocritical and neurosurgical care. A Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach was used to assess the certainty (or quality) of evidence and establish the direction and strength of recommendations for each PICO-based question. We provide evidence-based recommendations for the optimal treatment and diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis, alongside expert opinion.

This was an observational extension of the myPACE randomized clinical trial with up to 4 years of follow-up in 100 patients with stage B or C HFpEF and preexisting physiologic pacemakers treated at the University of Vermont Medical Center. The myPACE study was conducted from June 2019 to December 2021; follow-up for this report was concluded in June 2023. Participants in the original myPACE trial were randomly assigned to either personalized accelerated pacing (myPACE) or 60 bpm (usual care). The primary outcome was the accrual of first and recurrent adverse clinical events during the open-label follow-up phase-including urgent visits or hospitalizations for heart failure or atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, stroke, or death-assessed using an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and a prespecified per-protocol (PP) analysis of patients who continued their assigned treatment. Secondary outcomes included event-free survival in both ITT and PP analyses. Among the 100 original trial participants (48 in myPACE and 52 in usual care), the ITT analysis demonstrated a trend toward slower event accrual with the myPACE intervention (15 vs 33 events; Lin-Wei-Ying-Yang estimate [LWYY], 0.48; 95% CI, 0.22-1.06; P = .07) and longer event-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.31-1.29; P = .20) but did not reach statistical significance. In the prespecified PP analysis, 87 remained on their assigned heart rate setting over the 4-year follow-up (39 in myPACE and 48 in usual care). The mean (SD) age was 74 (10) years, and 48 participants (55%) were male. In this PP analysis, myPACE was associated with a slower accrual of clinical events (5 vs 31 events; LWYY, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.04-0.67; P = .01) and longer event-free survival (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11-0.80; P = .02) compared to usual care. These results were primarily driven by heart failure-related events. In this observational clinical events analysis of the myPACE trial, analysis by ITT did not achieve statistical significance between study arms. However, PP analysis showed that personalized accelerated physiologic pacing was associated with a slower accrual of adverse clinical events compared with the standard 60-bpm setting. These results are hypothesis generating and warrant confirmation in larger multicenter trials. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04721314.",

In the multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, we consecutively recruited adult H. pylori -infected patients from 6 centers in Taiwan. Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to 14-day vonoprazan high-dose dual, vonoprazan triple, or rabeprazole reverse hybrid therapy. Eradication status was determined by 13 C-urea breath test. The primary outcome was the eradication rate of H. pylori assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Between December 2021 and April 2024, 906 patients were recruited. The eradication rates were 83.8% (253/302) for vonoprazan high-dose dual therapy, 90.1% (272/302) for vonoprazan triple therapy, and 89.1% (271/302) for rabeprazole reverse hybrid therapy in intention-to-treat analysis. Vonoprazan high-dose dual therapy was inferior to both vonoprazan triple (95% confidence interval -11.5% to -1.1%; P = 0.022) and rabeprazole reverse hybrid therapies (95% confidence interval -10.7% to 0.1%; P = 0.031). There were no significant differences in the overall proportions of patients experiencing adverse events among vonoprazan high-dose dual, vonoprazan triple, and rabeprazole reverse hybrid groups (10.3%, 15.2%, and 15.6%, respectively). Body weight ≥60 kg, clarithromycin resistance, and poor drug adherence were independent risk factors predicting eradication failure for the 3 corresponding therapies, with odds ratios of 3.2 (1.3-7.5), 4.8 (1.2-18.9), and 14.8 (2.8-78.8), respectively.

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of a low-dose paclitaxel-coated vs uncoated balloon among patients with multilayer or single-layer ISR in the AGENT IDE (A Clinical Trial to Assess the Agent Paclitaxel Coated PTCA Balloon Catheter for the Treatment of Subjects With In-Stent Restenosis) trial.

Randomization was stratified by multi- vs single-layer ISR as well as by center. The primary study endpoint was 1-year target lesion failure (TLF): composite occurrence of ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR), target vessel-related myocardial infarction (MI), or cardiac death. Of the 600 patients randomized in the trial, multilayer ISR was present in 258 (44%) patients. Patients with multilayer ISR had higher rates of TLF at 1 year compared with those with single-layer ISR (29.0% vs 15.7%, P < 0.0001).

In this guideline, we update the pharmacotherapy recommendations in the 2020 Canadian clinical practice guideline on obesity in adults and in the 2022 pharmacotherapy for obesity management revision to provide current recommendations for clinicians on the efficacy, safety, and appropriate use of pharmacotherapy in the management of obesity in adults. This guideline update follows the same methodology as the 2020 Canadian guideline on obesity in adults, adhering to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation instrument and using the Shekelle framework to assess and grade evidence and to formulate recommendations. Building on the search conducted for the 2022 pharmacotherapy revision, we conducted a systematic literature review (search dates January 2022 to July 2024), supplemented by relevant trials published through May 2025, to identify studies assessing the efficacy of pharmacotherapy for weight management. We also conducted 13 targeted searches on the management of weight-related complications in 13 subpopulations with important adiposity-related health issues. We engaged primary care physicians, obesity medicine specialists, and people with lived experience of obesity to provide feedback on the recommendations. This update includes 6 new and 7 revised recommendations since the 2022 pharmacotherapy guideline revision (all 2020 pharmacotherapy recommendations are updated). Measures of central adiposity, in addition to ethnicity-specific body mass index and adiposity-related complications, should be used to guide the decision to initiate pharmacotherapy. Obesity pharmacotherapy should be used in conjunction with health behaviour changes and individualized based on a person's specific health needs and in keeping with their values and preferences. Recommendations support long-term use of obesity pharmacotherapy for sustained weight loss and maintenance of weight loss. We provide recommendations for use of specific obesity pharmacotherapies with proven benefit in specific subpopulations - atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, osteoarthritis - and for those with certain specific monogenic causes of obesity. We recommend against the use of compounded medications or medications other than those approved for weight loss in people with excess adiposity. Pharmacotherapy in obesity facilitates clinically meaningful weight loss and important improvements in obesity-related health complications. Clinicians who treat people with obesity with or without obesity-related health complications should appropriately use pharmacotherapy as an integral part of their treatment paradigm.",

Building on the search conducted for the 2022 pharmacotherapy revision, we conducted a systematic literature review (search dates January 2022 to July 2024), supplemented by relevant trials published through May 2025, to identify studies assessing the efficacy of pharmacotherapy for weight management. We also conducted 13 targeted searches on the management of weight-related complications in 13 subpopulations with important adiposity-related health issues. We engaged primary care physicians, obesity medicine specialists, and people with lived experience of obesity to provide feedback on the recommendations."

Measures of central adiposity, in addition to ethnicity-specific body mass index and adiposity-related complications, should be used to guide the decision to initiate pharmacotherapy. Obesity pharmacotherapy should be used in conjunction with health behaviour changes and individualized based on a person's specific health needs and in keeping with their values and preferences. Recommendations support long-term use of obesity pharmacotherapy for sustained weight loss and maintenance of weight loss. We provide recommendations for use of specific obesity pharmacotherapies with proven benefit in specific subpopulations - atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, osteoarthritis - and for those with certain specific monogenic causes of obesity. We recommend against the use of compounded medications or medications other than those approved for weight loss in people with excess adiposity."

Our trial aimed to measure the efficacies of artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate-amodiaquine, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, and artesunate-pyronaridine in three sites in Uganda. This randomised, open-label, phase 4 clinical trial was carried out at three sites in the Agago, Arua, and Busia districts of Uganda. Children aged 6 months to 10 years with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were randomly assigned to receive either artemether-lumefantrine (20 mg artemether; 120 mg lumefantrine; twice a day for 3 days) in all sites or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (40 mg dihydroartemisinin and 320 mg piperaquine, once a day for 3 days) in Agago, artesunate-amodiaquine (25 mg artesunate and 67·5 mg amodiaquine for children <9 kg or 50 mg artesunate and 135 mg amodiaquine for children ≥9 kg, once a day for 3 days) in Busia; and artesunate-pyronaridine (60 mg artesunate and 180 mg pyronaridine for children >15 kg or 20 mg artesunate and 60 mg pyronaridine for children <15 kg, once a day for 3 days) in Arua, with follow-up to 42 days. Participants were not blinded to group assignments; however, investigators and those assessing outcome were masked. The primary outcome was parasitaemia, assessed by microscopy, either uncorrected or PCR-corrected to distinguish recrudescence from new infection. All participants who received the treatment per protocol and were not lost to follow-up were included in the primary outcome. All participants who were randomly allocated to treatment groups were included in the safety analyses. This study is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, number PACTR202301796134887, and is complete. Between Nov 7, 2022, and March 24, 2023, 808 participants (437 [54%] female) were enrolled and assigned to treatment groups; 15 (2%) were lost to follow-up and 793 (98%) completed follow-up. The uncorrected adequate clinical and parasitological response for artemether-lumefantrine was 87 (51·8%; 95% CI 44·0-59·5) of 168 participants in Arua, 88 (51·8%; 44·0-59·4) of 170 and Busia, and 131 (79·4%; 72·3-85·1) of 165 in Agago. This response for artemether-lumefantrine was lower than that of the other ACTs at all sites: 97 (98·0%; 92·2-99·6) of 99 for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in Agago, 95 (99·0%; 93·5-99·9) of 96 for artesunate-amodiaquine in Busia, and 73 (73·7%; 63·8-81·8) of 99 for artesunate-pyronaridine in Arua. PCR-corrected 28-day efficacies were 88 (81·5%; 72·6-88·1) of 108 for artemether-lumefantrine and 95 (100%; 95·2-100·0) of 95 for artesunate-amodiaquine in Busia; 131 (97·0%; 92·1-99·0) of 135 for artemether-lumefantrine and 97 (100%; 95·3-100·0) of 97 for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in Agago; and 87 (82·1%; 73·2-88·6) of 106 for artemether-lumefantrine and 73 (92·4%; 83·6-96·9) of 79 for artesunate-pyronaridine in Arua. All regimens were well tolerated. The most common adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhoea, and anaemia. None of the reported adverse events were attributed to the study drugs. There were two serious adverse events, both cases of severe malaria in Arua, one in each of the treatment groups. Parasite clearance half-lives were prolonged with parasites carrying the PfK13 Cys469Tyr (median 4·2 h; IQR 3·4-4·9) and Ala675Val (4·9 h; 3·4-5·7) mutations compared with wild-type parasites (2·8 h; 2·3-3·6; p<0·0001). Artemether-lumefantrine was associated with a higher risk of recurrent malaria than other antimalarial combinations tested, and K13 mutations were associated with delayed parasite clearance.

To determine long-term outcomes in patients randomized to functional (stress) vs anatomic (coronary computed tomographic angiography [CTA]) initial testing. This study is a 2025 follow-up analysis of mortality of participants in the PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) randomized clinical trial, which was conducted from 2009 to 2014, using a 2024 National Death Index search. Median (IQR) follow-up duration was 10.6 (9.9-11.3) years; maximum follow-up was 12.4 years. PROMISE was conducted at 193 multispecialty outpatient sites in North America among 10 003 symptomatic patients requiring testing for suspected CAD. Data analysis was conducted from August 2024 to March 2025. Participants were randomized 1:1 to initial CTA or stress testing. Testing and subsequent care were performed by sites according to usual practices. The PROMISE trial's original primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina hospitalization, or major procedural complication. The primary end point for extended follow-up was all-cause death, with cardiovascular (CV) death as a secondary end point. At enrollment, mean (SD) participant age was 61 (8) years, 5270 participants (52.7%) were women, and 8762 (87.6%) had chest pain or dyspnea. Death occurred in 1128 participants (14.4%), including 558 (14.3%) in the CTA arm and 570 (14.5%) in the stress arm (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.87-1.10). There was no demonstrable difference in cardiovascular mortality, although the point estimate favored CTA (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67-1.05; adjusted HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.41-1.94). There were no significant interactions between all-cause death or CV death and study arm by age (<60 or ≥60 years) (P value for interaction = .19), gender (P value for interaction = .60), or race and ethnicity (P value for interaction = .47). A CTA indicating any degree of abnormality, including mild (nonobstructive CAD), moderate, and severe findings, conferred elevated adjusted HRs of death (1.99-3.44; all P < .001) compared to normal study results. Among stress testing results, only a severe abnormality was prognostically significant (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.10-1.91). In landmark analyses of those alive at 90 days, there were no interactions between randomized testing and use of statins (P value for interaction = .22), β-blockers (P value for interaction = .76), or antiplatelet agents (P value for interaction = .49). In long-term follow-up of the PROMISE randomized clinical trial, initial noninvasive test selection in patients with stable symptoms of suspected CAD did not affect all-cause or CV mortality at 10 years.

In landmark analyses of those alive at 90 days, there were no interactions between randomized testing and use of statins (P value for interaction = .22), β-blockers (P value for interaction = .76), or antiplatelet agents (P value for interaction = .49)."

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in this patient population. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we updated our previous systematic review by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature for randomised controlled trials published between database inception and March 18, 2025. Trials comparing a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with placebo or standard of care in adults (aged ≥18 years) receiving maintenance dialysis were eligible. Studies that did not report an outcome of interest (cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalisation, all-cause mortality, all-cause hospitalisation, hyperkalaemia, gynaecomastia or breast pain, or hypotension) were excluded. Two reviewers independently identified studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The main outcome was cardiovascular mortality assessed using the empirical Bayes random-effects models, stratified by risk-of-bias. The protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251008119). 19 trials of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists including 4675 participants met eligibility criteria.

In four trials with a low risk of bias (n=3562), 264 cardiovascular deaths occurred in 1785 patients in the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist group compared with 276 of 1777 patients in the control group (odds ratio 0·98 [95% CI 0·80-1·20]; I=0·0%; τ=0·0; moderate certainty) resulting in an absolute risk reduction of 1 fewer event per 1000 patients per year (95% CI 14 fewer to 11 more). Our findings suggest that steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have little to no effect on cardiovascular mortality in patients requiring dialysis. There is insufficient information on the effects of steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in subgroups of patients requiring dialysis and no information on non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

However, the evidence for this recommendation has not been reassessed recently. To determine whether current evidence continues to support the recommended 5 to 7 days of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Searches were performed of the Embase, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL databases for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) from inception to September 25, 2024. The search query included the keywords gastrointestinal bleeding and prophylactic antibiotics. Included RCTs compared longer durations of antibiotic prophylaxis to shorter durations (or 0 days) in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Observational and pediatric studies, gray literature, comparisons of systemic antibiotics, studies not reporting mortality or early rebleed, and studies of nonsystemic antibiotics were excluded. Data were extracted in duplicate by independent reviewers. Study quality was assessed in duplicate using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. Data were pooled by random-effects bayesian meta-analyses using a noninformative prior for the effect and a weakly informative prior for heterogeneity. To account for therapeutic advancements, a post hoc subgroup analysis was performed for studies published after 2004. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality with a prespecified 5% noninferiority margin on the risk difference (RD) scale. Early rebleed and bacterial infections were secondary outcomes. The analysis included 14 RCTs totaling 1322 participants (mean age range, 41.5 to 62.0 years; 981 male [74.2%] individuals), of whom 1202 (90.9%) had a variceal source of bleeding. Study quality was low to moderate, bacterial infections were heterogeneously defined, and no studies reported adverse events. Two RCTs compared longer (5-7 days) to shorter (2-3 days) durations and 12 RCTs compared any prophylaxis (1-10 days) to none. Shorter durations (including none) had a 97.3% probability of noninferiority for all-cause mortality (RD, 0.9%; 95% credible interval [95% CrI],  -2.6 to 4.9). Shorter durations had a 73.8% probability of noninferiority for early rebleeding (RD, 2.9%; 95% CrI, -4.2 to 10.0) but were associated with more study-defined bacterial infections (RD, 15.2%; 95% CrI, 5.0 to 25.9). The probabilities of noninferiority of shorter durations for all 3 outcomes were higher in studies published after 2004. The findings of this systematic review and bayesian meta-analysis do not support the purported mortality benefit driving guideline recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeds. Although prophylaxis reduced reported infections, methodological concerns regarding infection definitions introduced high risk of bias. Higher-quality RCTs are needed to determine the benefit and optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis in the modern era of advanced interventions. Until these studies are available, clinicians should be aware that the current guideline recommendations are not based on high-quality evidence.",

      "abstract": "Optimal transfusion strategies for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are uncertain. The aim of this guideline is to provide recommendations for red blood cell transfusion in patients with AMI. These guidelines are based on evidence from randomized controlled trials of patients presenting with AMI and assigned to 2 different transfusion strategies (restrictive or liberal) based on hemoglobin concentrations or hematocrit levels before receipt of a transfusion. A meta-analysis of eligible trials was performed using Cochrane methods. The international panel followed GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods to summarize evidence and formulate recommendations. This guideline's primary perspective is that of the patient, including medical, financial, and psychological effects, with secondary consideration of health care system issues, particularly conservation of the limited and costly blood supply. For hospitalized patients with AMI, the panel suggests a liberal red cell transfusion strategy when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 10 g/dL (conditional recommendation, low-certainty evidence). A restrictive strategy of 7 to 8 g/dL may result in increased mortality in patients with AMI. The direction of the recommendation for the liberal strategy was based on the great importance of mortality for patients. The conditional recommendation was based on the low certainty of evidence and the competing consideration of blood supply conservation. Clinicians should adopt mitigation strategies to reduce potential adverse events associated with a liberal transfusion strategy, and all transfusion decisions should incorporate the clinical context rather than solely the hemoglobin concentration.",

      "abstract": "Sex-specific evidence on de-escalation strategies of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) remains limited. Females are often under-represented in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and sex-based subgroup analysis in RCTs yield conflicting results. We searched PubMed and EMBASE in September 2024 for RCTs that investigated DAPT strategies for patients with ACS. We examined whether there are differences in the efficacy and safety of de-escalation strategies (i.e., short-term DAPT (≤6 months), unguided de-escalation, and guided de-escalation with genotype or platelet function tests) compared to standard DAPT (12 months) between sexes. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to compare the efficacy and safety between sexes with p-value for test of moderators. The primary efficacy outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. The primary safety outcome was major or minor bleeding. Fourteen RCTs involving 35,901 patients with ACS (7,652 female patients, 28,249 male patients) were included. The effect of de-escalation strategies on the primary efficacy outcome was significantly different between female (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.95; I = 0%) and male patients (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.90-1.19; I = 15%), with p-value for test of moderators 0.019. The primary safety outcome showed no significant sex differences (p-value for test of moderators = 0.67). In conclusions, in patients with ACS, compared to standard DAPT, de-escalation strategies were more effective in reducing MACE in female than in their male counterparts. Meanwhile, de-escalation strategies were similarly safer for both sexes.",

The effectiveness and acceptability of internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) for women with bulimia nervosa in clinical settings in East Asia remain unclear. To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of a guided ICBT program to treat women with bulimia nervosa in Japan. This randomized clinical trial was conducted at 7 university hospitals in Japan between August 2022 and October 2024. This study enrolled female participants aged 13 to 65 years whose symptoms met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria for bulimia nervosa, had a body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 or greater, had internet access, and had no history of practicing CBT-related techniques within the past 2 years. Both the control and intervention groups received usual care. The intervention consisted of ICBT with additional guidance from a therapist. The therapy program was tailored to Japanese culture and grounded in a specific cognitive behavior model, and it was performed over a 12-week period. Severity of bulimia nervosa, measured by the weekly combined frequency of episodes involving binge eating and compensatory behaviors, was assessed by a blinded, independent rating team at baseline and at the 12-week intervention end point. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted using a linear mixed model with effect sizes calculated using Cohen d. A total of 61 women met the eligibility criteria and were randomized to the intervention group (n = 31) or the control group (n = 30). Participants were predominantly young (mean [SD] age, 27.8 [9.0] years), had normal weight (mean [SD] BMI, 21.1 [3.6]), and had a mean (SD) duration of illness of 9.3 (8.8) years; half (31 [50.8%]) were employed. Intent-to-treat analysis revealed that guided ICBT significantly reduced the weekly combined frequency of episodes involving binge eating and compensatory behaviors (by an adjusted mean difference of 9.84 episodes [95% CI, 2.49-17.18 episodes], P = .01; Cohen d = 0.73 [95% CI, 0.21-1.26]).

      "abstract": "Facing an increasing prevalence, diagnosis and management of dementia has become a global health challenge. While most cognitive assessments are based on paper tests, the current trend is to digitise them, using new technologies. We aimed to achieve a systematic review on touchscreen-based assessments for neurocognitive disorders. A search on four databases (PubMed, Embase, IEEE Xplore and Web of Science) was performed. Two investigators independently selected the articles and assessed their quality using the QUADAS-2 tool. We included articles whose participants were over 65 years, classified according to the presence/absence of major neurocognitive disorder (M-NCD) determined by conventional assessment of cognition, examined with a novel tool using a touchscreen device (tablet or smartphone). We finally retained 35 articles for the systematic review and 24 for the meta-analysis. Of the 35 articles included in the systematic review, participants had Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body disease or any type of dementia. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86-0.91) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.82-0.92), respectively. Performances of self-administered or brief assessment testings were similar to those of assessor-administered or longer duration testings. The major limitation of this review and meta-analysis is the multiplicity and diversity of methods (tools, cognition assessment and type of M-NCD), which make the comparison difficult. We conclude that brief and self-assessment touchscreen-based cognitive tests are appropriate and simple tools to screen major cognitive disorders that can be used in primary care. The study was registered in Prospero (CRD42022358725).",

To assess the efficacy and safety of stapokibart as an add-on treatment to intranasal corticosteroids in patients with severe uncontrolled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. From August 9, 2022, to April 28, 2023, this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 clinical trial, conducted at 51 hospitals in China, enrolled adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps who had a history of systemic corticosteroid use or sinonasal surgery and a bilateral nasal polyp score of 5 or greater (on a scale of 0-8) and a weekly mean nasal congestion score of 2 or greater (on a scale of 0-3). Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps was defined as blood eosinophils of 6.9% or greater (without asthma) or 3.7% or greater (with asthma) or an eosinophil count of 55 per high-power field or greater or 27% or greater in nasal polyp tissue. Patient follow-up was completed on June 25, 2024. Four weeks after initiation of mometasone furoate nasal spray, 100 µg in each nostril daily, patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous stapokibart, 300 mg, or placebo (1:1) every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. Both groups then received stapokibart for 28 weeks. Co-primary end points were changes from baseline in nasal polyp score (meaningful change threshold [MCT] ≥1 point) and nasal congestion score (MCT ≥0.5 points) at week 24 in all patients and in the population with eosinophilia. Among 180 patients randomized, 179 (mean age, 45 [SD, 12.9] years; 61 [34.1%] women) received at least 1 treatment dose (n = 90 for stapokibart; n = 89 for placebo). In the overall population, the least-squares (LS) mean change in nasal polyp score from baseline to week 24 in the stapokibart vs placebo groups was -2.6 vs -0.3 points, respectively, (LS mean difference, -2.3; 95% CI, -2.6 to -1.9; P < .001); in the population with eosinophilia, the change was -3.0 vs -0.4 points, respectively (LS mean difference, -2.5; 95% CI, -2.9 to -2.1; P < .001).

Serious adverse events were rare (2.2% in the stapokibart group vs 1.1% in the placebo group). Higher rates of arthralgia (7.8% vs 0%) and hyperuricemia (5.6% vs 1.1%) were reported with stapokibart vs placebo, respectively.

However, the effects of GLP-1RAs on VTE have not been tested in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). To investigate the impact of GLP-1RAs on VTE risk using data from RCTs. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled RCTs focusing on GLP-1RA use in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or obesity. Five databases were searched from inception to October 2024. The primary outcome was VTE, which was a composite of pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis, and VTE at other sites, and the secondary outcomes were the individual events. Twenty-seven RCTs with 84 003 patients were analyzed. The median incidence of VTE was 1.1 and 2.5 per 1000 patient-years in the GLP-1RA and placebo groups, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in overall VTE risk between GLP-1RA and placebo groups (risk ratio [RR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.46-1.07). However, GLP-1RAs were associated with a significantly lower risk of PE (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39-0.94).

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous alteplase administered 4.5 to 24 hours after stroke onset in patients with salvageable brain tissue, regardless of the presence of large vessel occlusion. This randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial was conducted at 26 stroke centers across China. A total of 372 patients with acute ischemic stroke and salvageable brain tissue identified by perfusion imaging were enrolled between June 21, 2021, and June 30, 2024 (final follow-up October 2, 2024). Eligibility criteria included stroke onset (or the midpoint between last known well and symptom recognition if onset was unknown) of 4.5 to 24 hours prior to presentation, and no initial plan for endovascular thrombectomy. Data were analyzed from December 2024 to February 2025. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a minimization algorithm to receive intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg/kg; maximum dose, 90 mg; n = 186) or standard medical treatment (n = 186). The primary efficacy outcome was functional independence, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 at 90 days. Safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours and all-cause mortality within 90 days. Among 372 patients who were enrolled (median [IQR] age, 72 [64-80] years; 160 [43%] women), all completed the trial. The primary outcome occurred in 75 of 186 patients (40%) in the alteplase group and 49 of 186 (26%) in the control group (adjusted risk ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.14-2.02]; P = .004; unadjusted risk difference, 13.98% [95% CI, 4.50%-23.45%]). The incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was higher with alteplase at 3.8% compared with 0.51% with standard treatment (adjusted risk ratio, 7.34 [95% CI, 1.54-34.84]; P = .01; unadjusted risk difference, 3.23% [0.28%-6.19%]), and mortality was 11% in both groups (adjusted risk ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.52-1.62]; P = .76; unadjusted risk difference, 0% [95% CI, -6.30% to 6.30%]). In patients with acute ischemic stroke with salvageable brain tissue identified by perfusion imaging who did not initially receive thrombectomy, intravenous alteplase administered 4.5 to 24 hours after onset provided functional benefit, despite an increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

The network for change in nausea intensity demonstrated statistically significant incoherence at the overall level. Within a minimally contextualized framework, as single agents, intravenous tropisetron and intravenous prochlorperazine are definitely among the most effective, intravenous metoclopramide and intravenous droperidol are possibly among the most effective, and oral ondansetron is definitely among the least effective; considering certain adverse reactions, intravenous metoclopramide, intravenous droperidol, and intravenous promethazine are definitely among the most harmful.",

We enrolled persons (excluding pregnant persons) in Madagascar who had clinically suspected bubonic plague during 2020-2024. Using an open-label noninferiority design, we compared two treatments included in the national plague guidelines: oral ciprofloxacin for 10 days (ciprofloxacin monotherapy) or injectable aminoglycoside for 3 days followed by oral ciprofloxacin for 7 days (aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin). The primary end point was treatment failure on day 11, with treatment failure defined as death, fever, secondary pneumonic plague, or alternative or prolonged plague treatment. To show noninferiority of ciprofloxacin monotherapy among patients with laboratory-confirmed or probable infections, the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval around the risk difference had to be less than 15 percentage points. A total of 933 patients underwent screening; 450 patients with suspected bubonic plague were enrolled and underwent randomization. A total of 220 patients (110 per group) had confirmed infection, and 2 (1 per group) had probable infection. Of the patients who underwent randomization, 53.2% were male, and the median age was 14 years (range, 2 to 72). Ciprofloxacin monotherapy was noninferior to aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin therapy: among the patients with confirmed or probable infection, treatment failure occurred in 9.0% (10 of 111 patients) in the ciprofloxacin monotherapy group and 8.1% (9 of 111 patients) in the aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin group (difference, 0.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -6.0 to 7.8). Noninferiority was consistent in other prespecified analysis populations. A total of 5 patients in the ciprofloxacin monotherapy group and 4 patients in the aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin group died, and secondary pneumonic plague developed in 3 patients in each group. The incidence of adverse events among patients with confirmed or probable infections was similar in the two groups - 18.0% in the ciprofloxacin monotherapy group and 18.9% in the aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin group had adverse events, and 7.2% and 5.4%, respectively, had serious adverse events.
