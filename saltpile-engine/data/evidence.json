      "abstract": "Pharmacotherapy is a key component of comprehensive obesity management, alongside behavioural therapy and metabolic and bariatric surgery. In this guideline, we update the pharmacotherapy recommendations in the 2020 Canadian clinical practice guideline on obesity in adults and in the 2022 pharmacotherapy for obesity management revision to provide current recommendations for clinicians on the efficacy, safety, and appropriate use of pharmacotherapy in the management of obesity in adults. This guideline update follows the same methodology as the 2020 Canadian guideline on obesity in adults, adhering to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation instrument and using the Shekelle framework to assess and grade evidence and to formulate recommendations. Building on the search conducted for the 2022 pharmacotherapy revision, we conducted a systematic literature review (search dates January 2022 to July 2024), supplemented by relevant trials published through May 2025, to identify studies assessing the efficacy of pharmacotherapy for weight management. We also conducted 13 targeted searches on the management of weight-related complications in 13 subpopulations with important adiposity-related health issues. We engaged primary care physicians, obesity medicine specialists, and people with lived experience of obesity to provide feedback on the recommendations. This update includes 6 new and 7 revised recommendations since the 2022 pharmacotherapy guideline revision (all 2020 pharmacotherapy recommendations are updated). Measures of central adiposity, in addition to ethnicity-specific body mass index and adiposity-related complications, should be used to guide the decision to initiate pharmacotherapy. Obesity pharmacotherapy should be used in conjunction with health behaviour changes and individualized based on a person's specific health needs and in keeping with their values and preferences. Recommendations support long-term use of obesity pharmacotherapy for sustained weight loss and maintenance of weight loss. We provide recommendations for use of specific obesity pharmacotherapies with proven benefit in specific subpopulations - atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, osteoarthritis - and for those with certain specific monogenic causes of obesity. We recommend against the use of compounded medications or medications other than those approved for weight loss in people with excess adiposity. Pharmacotherapy in obesity facilitates clinically meaningful weight loss and important improvements in obesity-related health complications. Clinicians who treat people with obesity with or without obesity-related health complications should appropriately use pharmacotherapy as an integral part of their treatment paradigm.",

      "abstract": "Anti-malarial artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) might be losing efficacy in east Africa, with the spread of artemisinin partial resistance and reduced partner drug activity. Our trial aimed to measure the efficacies of artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate-amodiaquine, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, and artesunate-pyronaridine in three sites in Uganda. This randomised, open-label, phase 4 clinical trial was carried out at three sites in the Agago, Arua, and Busia districts of Uganda. Children aged 6 months to 10 years with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were randomly assigned to receive either artemether-lumefantrine (20 mg artemether; 120 mg lumefantrine; twice a day for 3 days) in all sites or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (40 mg dihydroartemisinin and 320 mg piperaquine, once a day for 3 days) in Agago, artesunate-amodiaquine (25 mg artesunate and 67·5 mg amodiaquine for children <9 kg or 50 mg artesunate and 135 mg amodiaquine for children ≥9 kg, once a day for 3 days) in Busia; and artesunate-pyronaridine (60 mg artesunate and 180 mg pyronaridine for children >15 kg or 20 mg artesunate and 60 mg pyronaridine for children <15 kg, once a day for 3 days) in Arua, with follow-up to 42 days. Participants were not blinded to group assignments; however, investigators and those assessing outcome were masked. The primary outcome was parasitaemia, assessed by microscopy, either uncorrected or PCR-corrected to distinguish recrudescence from new infection. All participants who received the treatment per protocol and were not lost to follow-up were included in the primary outcome. All participants who were randomly allocated to treatment groups were included in the safety analyses. This study is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, number PACTR202301796134887, and is complete. Between Nov 7, 2022, and March 24, 2023, 808 participants (437 [54%] female) were enrolled and assigned to treatment groups; 15 (2%) were lost to follow-up and 793 (98%) completed follow-up. The uncorrected adequate clinical and parasitological response for artemether-lumefantrine was 87 (51·8%; 95% CI 44·0-59·5) of 168 participants in Arua, 88 (51·8%; 44·0-59·4) of 170 and Busia, and 131 (79·4%; 72·3-85·1) of 165 in Agago. This response for artemether-lumefantrine was lower than that of the other ACTs at all sites: 97 (98·0%; 92·2-99·6) of 99 for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in Agago, 95 (99·0%; 93·5-99·9) of 96 for artesunate-amodiaquine in Busia, and 73 (73·7%; 63·8-81·8) of 99 for artesunate-pyronaridine in Arua. PCR-corrected 28-day efficacies were 88 (81·5%; 72·6-88·1) of 108 for artemether-lumefantrine and 95 (100%; 95·2-100·0) of 95 for artesunate-amodiaquine in Busia; 131 (97·0%; 92·1-99·0) of 135 for artemether-lumefantrine and 97 (100%; 95·3-100·0) of 97 for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in Agago; and 87 (82·1%; 73·2-88·6) of 106 for artemether-lumefantrine and 73 (92·4%; 83·6-96·9) of 79 for artesunate-pyronaridine in Arua. All regimens were well tolerated. The most common adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhoea, and anaemia. None of the reported adverse events were attributed to the study drugs. There were two serious adverse events, both cases of severe malaria in Arua, one in each of the treatment groups. Parasite clearance half-lives were prolonged with parasites carrying the PfK13 Cys469Tyr (median 4·2 h; IQR 3·4-4·9) and Ala675Val (4·9 h; 3·4-5·7) mutations compared with wild-type parasites (2·8 h; 2·3-3·6; p<0·0001). Artemether-lumefantrine was associated with a higher risk of recurrent malaria than other antimalarial combinations tested, and K13 mutations were associated with delayed parasite clearance. Changes in first-line therapy for uncomplicated malaria must be considered in response to suboptimal efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine.

      "abstract": "Symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD) often require noninvasive testing for diagnostic and prognostic evaluation. To determine long-term outcomes in patients randomized to functional (stress) vs anatomic (coronary computed tomographic angiography [CTA]) initial testing. This study is a 2025 follow-up analysis of mortality of participants in the PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) randomized clinical trial, which was conducted from 2009 to 2014, using a 2024 National Death Index search. Median (IQR) follow-up duration was 10.6 (9.9-11.3) years; maximum follow-up was 12.4 years. PROMISE was conducted at 193 multispecialty outpatient sites in North America among 10 003 symptomatic patients requiring testing for suspected CAD. Data analysis was conducted from August 2024 to March 2025. Participants were randomized 1:1 to initial CTA or stress testing. Testing and subsequent care were performed by sites according to usual practices. The PROMISE trial's original primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina hospitalization, or major procedural complication. The primary end point for extended follow-up was all-cause death, with cardiovascular (CV) death as a secondary end point. At enrollment, mean (SD) participant age was 61 (8) years, 5270 participants (52.7%) were women, and 8762 (87.6%) had chest pain or dyspnea. Death occurred in 1128 participants (14.4%), including 558 (14.3%) in the CTA arm and 570 (14.5%) in the stress arm (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.87-1.10). There was no demonstrable difference in cardiovascular mortality, although the point estimate favored CTA (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67-1.05; adjusted HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.41-1.94). There were no significant interactions between all-cause death or CV death and study arm by age (<60 or ≥60 years) (P value for interaction = .19), gender (P value for interaction = .60), or race and ethnicity (P value for interaction = .47). A CTA indicating any degree of abnormality, including mild (nonobstructive CAD), moderate, and severe findings, conferred elevated adjusted HRs of death (1.99-3.44; all P < .001) compared to normal study results. Among stress testing results, only a severe abnormality was prognostically significant (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.10-1.91). In landmark analyses of those alive at 90 days, there were no interactions between randomized testing and use of statins (P value for interaction = .22), β-blockers (P value for interaction = .76), or antiplatelet agents (P value for interaction = .49). In long-term follow-up of the PROMISE randomized clinical trial, initial noninvasive test selection in patients with stable symptoms of suspected CAD did not affect all-cause or CV mortality at 10 years.

Searches were performed of the Embase, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL databases for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) from inception to September 25, 2024. The search query included the keywords gastrointestinal bleeding and prophylactic antibiotics. Included RCTs compared longer durations of antibiotic prophylaxis to shorter durations (or 0 days) in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Data were extracted in duplicate by independent reviewers. Study quality was assessed in duplicate using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. Data were pooled by random-effects bayesian meta-analyses using a noninformative prior for the effect and a weakly informative prior for heterogeneity. To account for therapeutic advancements, a post hoc subgroup analysis was performed for studies published after 2004. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality with a prespecified 5% noninferiority margin on the risk difference (RD) scale. Early rebleed and bacterial infections were secondary outcomes. The analysis included 14 RCTs totaling 1322 participants (mean age range, 41.5 to 62.0 years; 981 male [74.2%] individuals), of whom 1202 (90.9%) had a variceal source of bleeding.

Shorter durations (including none) had a 97.3% probability of noninferiority for all-cause mortality (RD, 0.9%; 95% credible interval [95% CrI],  -2.6 to 4.9). Shorter durations had a 73.8% probability of noninferiority for early rebleeding (RD, 2.9%; 95% CrI, -4.2 to 10.0) but were associated with more study-defined bacterial infections (RD, 15.2%; 95% CrI, 5.0 to 25.9). The probabilities of noninferiority of shorter durations for all 3 outcomes were higher in studies published after 2004. The findings of this systematic review and bayesian meta-analysis do not support the purported mortality benefit driving guideline recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeds. Although prophylaxis reduced reported infections, methodological concerns regarding infection definitions introduced high risk of bias.

We aimed to test the hypothesis that prior clipping can reduce ectopic embolism secondary to endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection (ECI) in gastric varices with a gastrorenal shunt. In this multicenter, open-label, parallel, randomized controlled trial, patients with fundal gastric varices and gastrorenal shunts from 10 tertiary hospitals were randomly assigned to clip-assisted ECI (Clip-ECI, n = 35) and conventional ECI groups (Con-ECI, n = 35). The primary outcome was the occurrence of ectopic embolism. Computed tomography was performed within 48 hours of the initial injection to screen for cyanoacrylate (marked with lipiodol) migration. The technical success rate was 100% in both groups. The Clip-ECI group had a significantly lower incidence of cyanoacrylate embolism than the Con-ECI group (11.4% vs 42.9%, P = 0.003). Symptomatic pulmonary embolism occurred in 4 patients in the Con-ECI group, of which 1 patient died. By contrast, no symptomatic embolism event was observed in the Clip-ECI group (11.4% vs 0%, P = 0.114). No clip-related bleeding was reported. No significant differences were observed in the total rebleeding rate (14.3% vs 14.3%) and survival rate (97.1% vs 93.9%) between the Clip-ECI and Con-ECI groups during a median follow-up of 10.1 (interquartile range 7.7-12.9) and 9.9 (interquartile range 6.3-12.6) months, respectively.

      "abstract": "Sex-specific evidence on de-escalation strategies of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) remains limited. Females are often under-represented in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and sex-based subgroup analysis in RCTs yield conflicting results. We searched PubMed and EMBASE in September 2024 for RCTs that investigated DAPT strategies for patients with ACS. We examined whether there are differences in the efficacy and safety of de-escalation strategies (i.e., short-term DAPT (≤6 months), unguided de-escalation, and guided de-escalation with genotype or platelet function tests) compared to standard DAPT (12 months) between sexes. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to compare the efficacy and safety between sexes with p-value for test of moderators. The primary efficacy outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. The primary safety outcome was major or minor bleeding. Fourteen RCTs involving 35,901 patients with ACS (7,652 female patients, 28,249 male patients) were included. The effect of de-escalation strategies on the primary efficacy outcome was significantly different between female (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.95; I = 0%) and male patients (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.90-1.19; I = 15%), with p-value for test of moderators 0.019. The primary safety outcome showed no significant sex differences (p-value for test of moderators = 0.67). In conclusions, in patients with ACS, compared to standard DAPT, de-escalation strategies were more effective in reducing MACE in female than in their male counterparts. Meanwhile, de-escalation strategies were similarly safer for both sexes.",

To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of a guided ICBT program to treat women with bulimia nervosa in Japan. This randomized clinical trial was conducted at 7 university hospitals in Japan between August 2022 and October 2024. This study enrolled female participants aged 13 to 65 years whose symptoms met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria for bulimia nervosa, had a body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 or greater, had internet access, and had no history of practicing CBT-related techniques within the past 2 years.

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common complication that increases the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and kidney failure. Recent therapies, including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitors, show promise in improving outcomes. However, evidence of their comparative effectiveness in reducing CV and renal outcomes is scarce. We searched electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and clinical trial registries for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2014 and 2024. A network meta-analysis (NMA) was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of antidiabetic drugs on cardiorenal outcomes. Primary outcomes were (1) major adverse CV events (MACE), (2) composite renal outcomes, (3) all-cause mortality. Other outcomes included heart failure (HF), stroke, macroalbuminuria, and a decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >40% or renal replacement therapy. Twenty-six studies with 143 296 participants with T2DM and CKD were included. SGLT2 inhibitors were highly effective in reducing the risk of renal outcomes such as composite events (P-score: 0.94), eGFR decline >40% or renal replacement therapy (0.99) and CV outcomes such as MACE (0.93) and HF (1.00) followed by GLP-1 RA. While GLP-1 RA was particularly effective in reducing the risk of MI (0.87), macroalbuminuria (0.86) and stroke (0.83) compared to SGLT2 inhibitors.

      "abstract": "Facing an increasing prevalence, diagnosis and management of dementia has become a global health challenge. While most cognitive assessments are based on paper tests, the current trend is to digitise them, using new technologies. We aimed to achieve a systematic review on touchscreen-based assessments for neurocognitive disorders. A search on four databases (PubMed, Embase, IEEE Xplore and Web of Science) was performed. Two investigators independently selected the articles and assessed their quality using the QUADAS-2 tool. We included articles whose participants were over 65 years, classified according to the presence/absence of major neurocognitive disorder (M-NCD) determined by conventional assessment of cognition, examined with a novel tool using a touchscreen device (tablet or smartphone). We finally retained 35 articles for the systematic review and 24 for the meta-analysis. Of the 35 articles included in the systematic review, participants had Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body disease or any type of dementia. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86-0.91) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.82-0.92), respectively. Performances of self-administered or brief assessment testings were similar to those of assessor-administered or longer duration testings. The major limitation of this review and meta-analysis is the multiplicity and diversity of methods (tools, cognition assessment and type of M-NCD), which make the comparison difficult. We conclude that brief and self-assessment touchscreen-based cognitive tests are appropriate and simple tools to screen major cognitive disorders that can be used in primary care. The study was registered in Prospero (CRD42022358725).",

From August 9, 2022, to April 28, 2023, this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 clinical trial, conducted at 51 hospitals in China, enrolled adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps who had a history of systemic corticosteroid use or sinonasal surgery and a bilateral nasal polyp score of 5 or greater (on a scale of 0-8) and a weekly mean nasal congestion score of 2 or greater (on a scale of 0-3).

Patient follow-up was completed on June 25, 2024.

Serious adverse events were rare (2.2% in the stapokibart group vs 1.1% in the placebo group). Higher rates of arthralgia (7.8% vs 0%) and hyperuricemia (5.6% vs 1.1%) were reported with stapokibart vs placebo, respectively.

      "abstract": "Obesity is an established risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Observational data suggest that glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) may reduce the risk of VTE. However, the effects of GLP-1RAs on VTE have not been tested in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). To investigate the impact of GLP-1RAs on VTE risk using data from RCTs. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled RCTs focusing on GLP-1RA use in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or obesity. Five databases were searched from inception to October 2024. The primary outcome was VTE, which was a composite of pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis, and VTE at other sites, and the secondary outcomes were the individual events. Twenty-seven RCTs with 84 003 patients were analyzed. The median incidence of VTE was 1.1 and 2.5 per 1000 patient-years in the GLP-1RA and placebo groups, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in overall VTE risk between GLP-1RA and placebo groups (risk ratio [RR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.46-1.07). However, GLP-1RAs were associated with a significantly lower risk of PE (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39-0.94). In contrast, there were no significant differences in the risk of deep vein thrombosis (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.69-2.12) or VTE at other sites (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.25-1.26). In this meta-analysis of randomized trials, GLP-1RAs were not associated with a significant reduction in overall VTE risk but were associated with a lower risk of PE among patients with T2DM or obesity.",

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous alteplase administered 4.5 to 24 hours after stroke onset in patients with salvageable brain tissue, regardless of the presence of large vessel occlusion. This randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial was conducted at 26 stroke centers across China. A total of 372 patients with acute ischemic stroke and salvageable brain tissue identified by perfusion imaging were enrolled between June 21, 2021, and June 30, 2024 (final follow-up October 2, 2024). Eligibility criteria included stroke onset (or the midpoint between last known well and symptom recognition if onset was unknown) of 4.5 to 24 hours prior to presentation, and no initial plan for endovascular thrombectomy. Data were analyzed from December 2024 to February 2025. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a minimization algorithm to receive intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg/kg; maximum dose, 90 mg; n = 186) or standard medical treatment (n = 186). The primary efficacy outcome was functional independence, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 at 90 days. Safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours and all-cause mortality within 90 days. Among 372 patients who were enrolled (median [IQR] age, 72 [64-80] years; 160 [43%] women), all completed the trial. The primary outcome occurred in 75 of 186 patients (40%) in the alteplase group and 49 of 186 (26%) in the control group (adjusted risk ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.14-2.02]; P = .004; unadjusted risk difference, 13.98% [95% CI, 4.50%-23.45%]). The incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was higher with alteplase at 3.8% compared with 0.51% with standard treatment (adjusted risk ratio, 7.34 [95% CI, 1.54-34.84]; P = .01; unadjusted risk difference, 3.23% [0.28%-6.19%]), and mortality was 11% in both groups (adjusted risk ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.52-1.62]; P = .76; unadjusted risk difference, 0% [95% CI, -6.30% to 6.30%]). In patients with acute ischemic stroke with salvageable brain tissue identified by perfusion imaging who did not initially receive thrombectomy, intravenous alteplase administered 4.5 to 24 hours after onset provided functional benefit, despite an increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

      "abstract": "Low-complexity automated nucleic acid amplification tests (LC-aNAATs) are molecular World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended rapid diagnostic tests widely used for simultaneous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistance in sputum. To extend our previous review on extrapulmonary tuberculosis, we performed this update to inform a WHO policy update. To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of LC-aNAATs for extrapulmonary tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance in adults and adolescents with presumptive extrapulmonary tuberculosis. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry, and ProQuest, up to 11 October 2023, without language restriction. A WHO public call for data was made between 30th November 2023 and 15th February 2024 to identify unpublished studies. We included cross-sectional and cohort studies using non-respiratory specimens and eight forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis: tuberculous meningitis and pleural, lymph node, bone or joint, genitourinary, peritoneal, pericardial, and disseminated tuberculosis. Reference standards were culture and a study-defined composite reference standard (tuberculosis detection); and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing with or without genotypic drug susceptibility testing (rifampicin resistance detection). Index tests included Xpert Ultra, Truenat assays, STANDARD M10, and Iron qPCR. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias and applicability using the QUADAS-2 tool. For tuberculosis detection, we performed separate analyses by specimen type and reference standard using the bivariate model to estimate summary sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Based on a pre-defined condition, based on sample sizes and type of technology for performing class-based analysis, data for Truenat MTB Plus were not included in the meta-analyses for LC-aNAATs. Hence, we present results for Xpert Ultra and Truenat MTB Plus separately. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We included 37 unique studies where 36 studies evaluated Xpert Ultra and three studies evaluated Truenat MTB plus. We found no eligible studies for the other index tests. Overall, the risk of bias was low for patient selection, index test, and flow and timing domains. For the reference standard, the risk of bias for included studies was low (75%) or unclear (25%). Applicability for the patient selection domain was unclear for most studies because we were unsure of the clinical settings, and the applicability concern was low for most studies for the reference standard domain. Cerebrospinal fluid Xpert Ultra (16 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) against a microbiological reference standard were 88.2% (83.7 to 91.6) (287 participants; high-certainty evidence) and 96.0% (86.8 to 98.9) (1397 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Truenat MTB Plus (2 studies) There were not enough data to meta-analyze, and we have provided descriptive results for Truenat MTB Plus. The sensitivities in these two studies ranged from 95% to 100% while the specificities ranged from 55% to 100% against a microbiological reference standard. The sensitivity was 78.7% (70 to 86) and the specificity was 100% (91 to 100) against a composite reference standard from a single study. Pleural fluid Xpert Ultra (13 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity against a microbiological reference standard were 74.0% (60.8 to 83.9; 264 participants; low-certainty evidence) and 88.1% (78.8 to 93.6; 777 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Truenat MTB Plus (1 study) The sensitivity was 100% (2.5 to 100) and specificity was 100% (95.3 to 100) against a microbiological reference standard. Lymph node aspirate Xpert Ultra (6 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) against a composite reference standard were 71.3% (64.3 to 77.4) (243 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and 97.4% (82.3 to 99.7) (218 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Truenat MTB Plus (1 study) The sensitivity and specificity were 77.1% (66 to 86) and 100% (88 to 100), respectively, against a microbiological reference standard. The sensitivity was 100% (81 to 100) and specificity was 56% (45 to 67) against a composite reference standard. Rifampicin resistance Xpert Ultra (13 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity and specificity were 100.0% (93.4 to 100.0; 54 participants; high-certainty evidence) and 99.4% (92.1 to 100.0; 392 participants; high-certainty evidence). LC-aNAATs are helpful in diagnosing extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Sensitivity varies across different extrapulmonary specimens, while for most specimens specificity is high, the tests rarely yielding a positive result for people without tuberculosis. For tuberculous meningitis, Xpert Ultra had high sensitivity against culture. Xpert Ultra also had high sensitivity and specificity for rifampicin resistance. Future research should acknowledge the concern associated with culture as a reference standard in paucibacillary specimens and consider ways to address this limitation. Additionally, there is a critical need for robust evidence on other technologies within the LC-aNAAT class. Funded by the WHO Global Tuberculosis Program.

      "abstract": "Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are autoimmune-mediated inflammatory disorders of skeletal muscles with non-muscle involvement in some people, which carry significant morbidity and mortality. Treatment of IIM represents an area of unmet need. This review is an update of a review previously published in 2012, as new and promising data on non-targeted treatments have emerged. To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of non-targeted immunosuppressant and immunomodulatory treatments for IIM: dermatomyositis (DM, including juvenile dermatomyositis, jDM), immune-mediated necrotising myopathy (IMNM), anti-synthetase syndrome (ASS), overlap-myositis (OM) and polymyositis (PM). We also included cancer-related myositis and amyopathic dermatomyositis. On 3 February 2023, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP. We intended to check references and citations, and contact experts to identify additional studies, but lacked the resources. We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs involving participants (adults and children) with IIM according to defined criteria. We included non-targeted immunosuppressants and immunomodulatory treatments alone or in combination, compared with a placebo, no treatment or another non-targeted immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory treatment. Our two primary outcomes were improvement of function or disability and improvement of muscle strength compared with baseline. By preference, we used the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) for disability and the Manual Muscle Test-8 (MMT8) score (adults or children) for muscle strength. Other outcomes were achievement of definitions of improvement (DOI) (the International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies (IMACS) Group or the more recent total improvement scores (TIS); for children, we reported achievement of improvement defined by the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation (PRINTO)), cumulative corticosteroid dose, change in skin disease activity, serious adverse event and withdrawals for lack of benefit or adverse events. We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias, we used the domain-based Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 1). We used fixed-effect models and, when needed, random-effects models for meta-analysis. We created summary of findings tables for any comparison for which data were available but prioritised comparisons of the following with placebo, no treatment or standard care: immunoglobulin, azathioprine and methotrexate. We included other comparisons as additional tables. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We identified 16 studies (789 participants). The risk of bias in all but one study was high or unclear. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), compared to placebo, probably improves disability and muscle strength in participants with refractory IIM (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.21 (disability) and 0.78, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.13 (muscle strength); 3 RCTs, 136 participants; both moderate-certainty evidence). IVIg has a higher response rate based on American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) criteria than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.80, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.56; 1 RCT, 95 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). IVIg, compared to placebo, improves skin symptoms (Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index (CDASI) total activity score 0 to 100; higher worse) in people with refractory DM (mean difference (MD) -8.20, 95% CI -11.91 to -4.49; 1 RCT, 95 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There may be more serious adverse events with IVIg than with placebo (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.50 to 7.30; 2 RCTs, 144 participants; very low-certainty evidence), but little or no difference between IVIg and placebo in withdrawals for either lack of benefit or adverse events (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.24 to 4.33; 3 RCTs, 154 participants; very low-certainty evidence). For azathioprine versus placebo, one study showed little or no effect of azathioprine on improvement in muscle strength, but the evidence was very uncertain (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.43 to 4.13; 1 RCT; 16 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence was also very uncertain for cumulative steroid dose (MD 12.06 mg/kg, 95% CI -6.09 to 30.21; 1 RCT, 16 participants; very low-certainty evidence). This early study did not assess IMACS DOI or CDASI or measure function or disability. Serious adverse events and withdrawals for either lack of benefit or adverse events were not systematically reported. For methotrexate, there may be little or no improvement in adults with DM or PM in function (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale 0 to 40, higher better) (MD 1.24, 95% CI -1.60 to 4.08; 1 RCT, 27 participants; very low-certainty evidence), muscle strength (MMT scale 0 to 80, higher better) (MD -5.68, 95% CI -12.94 to 1.58; 1 RCT, 27 participants; very low-certainty evidence), achievement of IMACS DOI (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.39; 1 RCT, 27 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Cumulative steroid dose was measured, but the data could not be analysed, and change in CDASI was not measured. In children with new-onset jDM on a background therapy of prednisone, a higher proportion may achieve minimal improvement according to the PRINTO criteria with methotrexate than with placebo (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.96; 1 RCT, 93 participants; low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events may occur slightly more frequently with methotrexate (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.54 to 4.07; 2 RCTs, 124 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be fewer withdrawals for lack of benefit or adverse events with methotrexate (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.05; 3 RCTs, 151 participants; low-certainty evidence). Our review shows improvement in disability, muscle strength and skin symptoms following IVIg in people with refractory DM (for PM, these data are not reliable; other subtypes have not been investigated in RCTs). The improvements related to IVIg in DM may be clinically meaningful, but the absence of established minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for both disability and muscle strength in IIM does not facilitate interpretation. For the other agents, the small number of trials of immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies is inadequate to decide whether these agents are beneficial in IIM (excluding IBM). Our review shows room for improvement in the conduct and reporting of clinical trials in IIM, as well as the need to further investigate MCIDs for important outcome measures in IIM.",

      "abstract": "Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with either skin or joints manifestations, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Despite multiple available treatments, their comparative efficacies and safety remain unclear due to the limited number of direct comparisons. We conducted a network meta-analysis to comprehensively compare systemic treatments. To compare the benefits and harms of non-targeted systemic agents, targeted synthetic agents, and biologic targeted treatments for people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis using a network meta-analysis, and to rank these treatments according to their benefits and harms. For this update of the living systematic review, we updated our searches monthly up to July 2024 in the following databases and trial registers: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP. Randomised controlled trials of systemic pharmacological treatments in adults over 18 years of age with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, compared to placebo or another active agent, irrespective of dose and duration. The critical outcomes were proportion of participants who achieved clear or almost clear skin, that is, at least Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 and proportion of participants with serious adverse events (SAEs) at induction phase (8 to 24 weeks after randomisation). We used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We conducted study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, and analysis in duplicate. We synthesised data using pairwise and network meta-analyses to compare treatments and rank them according to effectiveness (PASI 90 score) and acceptability (inverse of SAEs). We assessed the certainty of network meta-analysis evidence for the two critical outcomes and all comparisons using CINeMA, as very low, low, moderate, or high. We contacted study authors when data were unclear or missing. We used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to infer treatment hierarchy, from 0% (worst for effectiveness or safety) to 100% (best for effectiveness or safety). This update includes 26 new studies, taking the total number of included studies to 204, and randomised participants to 67,889 (67% men), mainly recruited from hospitals. The average age was 44.4 years, and the mean PASI score at baseline was 20.5 (range: 9.5 to 40). Most studies were placebo-controlled (56%). We assessed 26 treatments. Most (171) trials were multicentric (2 to 231 centres). Most studies (157/204) declared funding by a pharmaceutical company, and 27 studies did not report a funding source. Network meta-analysis at class level demonstrated that all interventions had a higher proportion of participants reaching PASI 90 than placebo. Anti-interleukin (IL)17 treatment showed a higher proportion of participants reaching PASI 90 compared to all the interventions. Biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha showed a higher proportion of participants reaching PASI 90 than the non-targeted systemic agents and the targeted systemic agents. For reaching PASI 90, the most effective drugs when compared to placebo were (in SUCRA rank order): infliximab (moderate-certainty evidence), xeligekimab (moderate-certainty), bimekizumab (high-certainty), ixekizumab (moderate-certainty), and risankizumab (moderate-certainty). Clinical effectiveness of these drugs was similar when compared against each other. There was evidence of a difference in favour of bimekizumab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab compared to secukinumab, brodalumab, and guselkumab in achieving PASI 90. Infliximab, anti-IL17 drugs (bimekizumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, sonelokimab, brodalumab), and anti-IL23 drugs (risankizumab and guselkumab) showed evidence of a difference in achieving PASI 90 compared to ustekinumab, tildrakizumab, three anti-TNF-alpha agents (adalimumab, certolizumab, and etanercept), and deucravacitinib. Ustekinumab was superior to certolizumab. Adalimumab, tildrakizumab, and ustekinumab were superior to etanercept, deucravacitinib, and apremilast. Ciclosporin and methotrexate were superior to apremilast for reaching PASI 90. We found no evidence of a difference between any of the interventions and the placebo for the risk of SAEs. Nevertheless, the SAEs analyses were based on a very low number of events with low-certainty evidence for most comparisons. Therefore, the findings must be viewed with caution. For PASI 90, 31% of studies (51/165) had a high risk of bias, 34% (56 studies) had some concerns, and 35% (58) had low risk. For SAEs, 57% (94/169) had a high risk of bias, 31% (53 studies) had some concerns, and 13% (22 studies) had low risk. Our review shows that, compared to placebo, the biologics infliximab, xeligekimab, bimekizumab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab were the most effective treatments for achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, with high-certainty evidence for bimekizumab and moderate-certainty evidence for infliximab, xeligekimab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab. This network meta-analysis evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes measured from 8 to 24 weeks after randomisation), and is not sufficient for evaluating longer-term outcomes in this chronic disease. Moreover, we found low numbers of studies for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean 44.4 years) and high level of disease severity (PASI 20.5 at baseline) may not be typical of people seen in daily clinical practice. More randomised trials directly comparing active agents are needed, and these should include systematic subgroup analyses (sex, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, psoriatic arthritis). To provide long-term information on the safety of treatments included in this review, an evaluation of non-randomised studies is needed. Our confidence in the results for non-targeted systemic treatments is limited due to concerns regarding study conduct. Further research is warranted and may modify these findings.

      "abstract": "Patients undergoing maintenance dialysis for kidney failure are at substantial risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We aimed to establish if spironolactone reduces heart failure and cardiovascular deaths in these patients. ACHIEVE was an international, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial done in 143 dialysis programmes in 12 countries. Patients were aged 45 years or older, or aged 18 years or older with a history of diabetes, and were receiving maintenance dialysis for kidney failure for at least 3 months at the time of recruitment. Patients who were able to tolerate and adhere to spironolactone 25 mg daily orally during an open-label run-in were randomly assigned (1:1) to continue spironolactone or matching placebo, using a central computerised block randomisation system (block sizes of 4) stratified by centre. Participants, health-care providers, and those assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular mortality or hospitalisation for heart failure analysed as time-to-event in all randomly assigned participants. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03020303. After a planned interim analysis of 75% of the expected primary outcome events, the external safety and efficacy monitoring committee recommended the trial be stopped early for futility. From Sept 19, 2017, to Oct 31, 2024, 3689 patients were screened for inclusion, 3565 of whom were enrolled in the open-label run-in phase, and 2538 were randomly assigned to spironolactone (n=1260) or placebo (n=1278). 931 (36·7%) participants were female and 1607 (63·3%) were male. Median follow-up was 1·8 years (IQR 0·85-3·35). The composite primary outcome occurred in 258 participants (10·46 events per 100 patient-years) in the spironolactone group and in 276 participants (11·33 per 100 patient-years) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·92 [95% CI 0·78-1·09]; p=0·35). Death from any cause was similar between groups (HR 0·95 [0·83-1·09]) as was hospitalisation for any cause (HR 0·96 [0·87-1·06]). Among patients receiving maintenance dialysis, spironolactone 25 mg daily orally did not reduce the composite outcome of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisation due to heart failure compared with placebo. This trial did not identify a benefit of initiating spironolactone in patients receiving maintenance dialysis. Future research should consider alternatives to steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients receiving maintenance haemodialysis.

      "abstract": "Trauma systems have become the standard of care in high-income countries, but remain uncommon in low- and middle-income countries. High-quality evidence of effectiveness is needed to advocate for the development of trauma systems in low- and middle-income countries, where the burden of injury is highest. To assess the benefits and harms of organised trauma systems and designated trauma centres compared with usual care in injured patients. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP on 16 December 2023. We also searched grey literature, checked reference lists of included studies, and contacted the authors of relevant studies. We included randomised controlled trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies comparing organised trauma systems or designated trauma centres with usual care. We planned to include patients who had had major trauma (i.e. Injury Severity Score greater than 15), but made a post-hoc decision to include patients regardless of injury severity. Studies were considered for inclusion regardless of date, language, or publication status. The critical outcomes were patient outcomes (such as mortality, survival, and recovery), and adverse effects. Important outcomes were utilisation and access to trauma care services, quality of care provided, equity, and knowledge about trauma care services. Studies only reported patient outcomes (mortality, survival); there were no reports on adverse effects, utilisation and access to services, quality of care, equity, and knowledge about trauma care services. We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool and guidance from the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) group to evaluate individual studies. Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence using GRADE. We could not perform a meta-analysis due to substantial clinical heterogeneity across studies. We re-analysed data from individual studies so they could be presented in a standardised format as relative effect, change in level, and change in slope. We summarised findings using a narrative synthesis. There were four interrupted time series studies (157,111 participants). Two studies (131,220 participants) compared organised trauma systems to usual care and two studies (25,891 participants) compared designated trauma centres to usual care. Two studies were conducted in the US, one in the UK, and one in Norway. It is very uncertain whether organised trauma systems reduce mortality compared to usual care because the certainty of the evidence was very low (2 studies, 131,220 participants). One study (20,357 participants, follow-up 6 years) reported reduced mortality with an organised trauma system intervention and a relative effect of -30% (change in level -2.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.17 to -0.86; change in slope -0.10, 95% CI -0.53 to 0.33). A second study (110,863 participants, follow-up 9 years) reported improved survival with intervention and a relative effect of 14% (change in level 0.13, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.76; an increase of 0.13 survival cases per quarter; change in slope 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.15). No studies reported data on adverse effects, utilisation and access to trauma care services, quality of care provided, equity, or knowledge about trauma care services. It is very uncertain whether designated trauma centres reduce mortality compared to usual care because the certainty of the evidence was very low (2 studies, 25,891 participants). One study (7247 participants) reported a decrease in mortality for all patients (relative effect -42%; change in level -3.60, 95% CI -11.26 to 4.07; change in slope -0.51, 95% CI -2.26 to 1.23), patients with Injury Severity Score 15 to 24 (relative effect -44%; change in level -8.80, 95% CI -29.61 to 12.00; change in slope -0.96, 95% CI -5.69 to 3.77), and patients with Injury Severity Score greater than 24 (relative effect -55%; change in level -17.87, 95% CI -47.12 to 11.37; change in slope -1.90, 95% CI -8.55 to 4.75). A second study (18,644 participants, follow-up 11 years) reported reduced mortality for adults (relative effect -67%; change in level -17.52, 95% CI -42.27 to 7.23; change in slope -2.09, 95% CI -6.22 to 2.04) and children (relative effect -84%; change in level -18.56, 95% CI -30.11 to -7.01; change in slope -1.12, 95% CI -3.04 to 0.80). No studies reported data on adverse effects, utilisation and access to trauma care services, quality of care provided, equity, or knowledge about trauma care services. The available evidence is currently insufficient to quantify the implications and impact of organised trauma systems and designated trauma centres on clinical practice. This is primarily due to a lack of studies with high methodological rigour for assessing the effects of clinical interventions, as well as the absence of reporting on important outcomes for determining their effectiveness. Future research could provide evidence by utilising observational studies with high methodological rigour when randomised trials are not feasible; and focus on collecting important outcomes such as the utilisation, access, and quality of care provided, and knowledge about trauma care services.

      "abstract": "Existing pharmacological treatments for insomnia have significant limitations. To assess the effective dose range, safety, and tolerability of the novel selective orexin-2 receptor antagonist seltorexant in insomnia disorder. This randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled, dose-finding, polysomnography study was conducted from November 2017 to April 2019 at 55 sites in 6 countries and analyzed in August 2019. The timeline for submission of this data for publication was impacted by internal strategic decision-making. Adults (aged 18-64 years) and older adults (aged 65-85 years) with insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index score ≥15) and no psychiatric comorbidity were included. Participants were randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive nightly oral-seltorexant (5 mg, 10 mg, or 20 mg), placebo, or zolpidem (5-10 mg) for 14 days. Primary and key secondary outcomes included the dose-response relationship of night 1 latency to persistent sleep (LPS) and wake after sleep onset over the first 6 hours (WASO-6). Other secondary outcomes included night 13 LPS and WASO-6. Due to asymmetrical distributions of LPS and WASO-6 at baseline, log transformation was applied and results were expressed as back-transformed least-squares mean (LSM) ratios for comparisons between groups. Overall, 364 participants (mean [SD] age, 57.8 [12.4] years; 246 [67.6%] female) received seltorexant, 5 mg (n = 71), 10 mg (n = 74), or 20 mg (n = 71); placebo (n = 75); or zolpidem (n = 73). The night 1 dose-response relationship for LPS was significant (with trend test t statistics ≥3.99 and adjusted P values <.001 for all 4 prespecified models), with greater improvements in seltorexant, 10 mg and 20 mg, vs placebo (10 mg: LSM ratio, 0.64; 90% CI, 0.51-0.81; 20 mg: LSM ratio, 0.51; 90% CI, 0.41-0.64) and in seltorexant, 20 mg, vs zolpidem (LSM ratio, 0.71; 90% CI, 0.57-0.88). The night 1 dose-response relationship for WASO-6 was also significant, with trend test t statistics ≥3.99 and adjusted P values <.001 for all 4 prespecified models (seltorexant, 10 mg: LSM ratio, 0.68; 90% CI, 0.55-0.85; seltorexant, 20 mg: LSM ratio, 0.60; 90% CI, 0.48-0.74). Night 1 LPS and WASO-6 improvements were maintained on night 13 for seltorexant, 10 mg and 20 mg, but diminished for zolpidem. On night 13, compared with zolpidem, seltorexant, 10 mg and 20 mg, improved LPS by 30% and 28%, respectively, and seltorexant, 20 mg, improved WASO-6 by 31%. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were lower across the combined seltorexant doses (73/216 [33.8%]) relative to placebo (37/75 [49.3%]) and zolpidem (31/73 [42.5%]). Two participants experienced serious TEAEs during the double-blind phase (1 in the seltorexant, 20 mg, group and 1 in the zolpidem group). Three participants in the seltorexant, 5 mg, and 1 in the seltorexant, 20 mg, group experienced asymptomatic electrocardiogram-related TEAEs leading to discontinuation. Among participants with insomnia in this study, seltorexant, 10 mg and 20 mg, improved sleep initiation and maintenance throughout 14 days of treatment. Seltorexant was generally well tolerated.

Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to 14-day vonoprazan high-dose dual, vonoprazan triple, or rabeprazole reverse hybrid therapy. Eradication status was determined by 13 C-urea breath test. The primary outcome was the eradication rate of H. pylori assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Between December 2021 and April 2024, 906 patients were recruited. The eradication rates were 83.8% (253/302) for vonoprazan high-dose dual therapy, 90.1% (272/302) for vonoprazan triple therapy, and 89.1% (271/302) for rabeprazole reverse hybrid therapy in intention-to-treat analysis. Vonoprazan high-dose dual therapy was inferior to both vonoprazan triple (95% confidence interval -11.5% to -1.1%; P = 0.022) and rabeprazole reverse hybrid therapies (95% confidence interval -10.7% to 0.1%; P = 0.031).

      "abstract": "Patients with coronary in-stent restenosis (ISR) within multiple layers of stent pose a specific clinical challenge because of higher rates of recurrent restenosis as well as a desire to avoid an additional layer of stent. Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) provide an alternative antiproliferative therapeutic option for multilayer ISR. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of a low-dose paclitaxel-coated vs uncoated balloon among patients with multilayer or single-layer ISR in the AGENT IDE (A Clinical Trial to Assess the Agent Paclitaxel Coated PTCA Balloon Catheter for the Treatment of Subjects With In-Stent Restenosis) trial. AGENT IDE is a prospective, multicenter trial that randomized patients with ISR (reference vessel diameter >2.0 mm to ≤4.0 mm and lesion length <26 mm) in a 2:1 allocation to paclitaxel-coated or an uncoated balloon following successful lesion preparation. Randomization was stratified by multi- vs single-layer ISR as well as by center. The primary study endpoint was 1-year target lesion failure (TLF): composite occurrence of ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR), target vessel-related myocardial infarction (MI), or cardiac death. Of the 600 patients randomized in the trial, multilayer ISR was present in 258 (44%) patients. Patients with multilayer ISR had higher rates of TLF at 1 year compared with those with single-layer ISR (29.0% vs 15.7%, P < 0.0001). The overall study results were consistent irrespective of multilayer vs single-layer ISR (P = 0.66). Among patients with multilayer ISR, TLF was lower with paclitaxel-coated balloon compared with an uncoated balloon (23.8% vs 40.0%; HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.34-0.87; P = 0.01), driven by reductions in both TLR and target vessel-related MI. Similar findings were observed among patients with single layer ISR (1-year TLF: 13.5% with paclitaxel-coated vs 20.2% with uncoated balloon; HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.37-1.11; P = 0.11), although absolute event rates were lower. Patients with ISR of multiple stent layers had higher rates of adverse stent-related events compared with patients with single-layer ISR. Treatment with a paclitaxel-coated balloon led to greater absolute risk reduction in 1-year TLF among patients with multilayer ISR compared with an uncoated balloon.
