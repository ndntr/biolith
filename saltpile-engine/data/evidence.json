      "abstract": "The reference for risk stratification and clinical trial selection of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) patients is fibrosis degree by histology. The noninvasive ANTICIPATE-NASH models have been validated for risk prediction of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) and liver-related events (LRE). We assessed whether these models provide better risk stratification of events than histology. A multicenter cohort 1, including 699 biopsy specimen-proven F3-F4 patients with MASLD was evaluated. The end point was LRE (hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, transplantation, or liver-related death). We assessed (Cox regression) whether histology provided added value to ANTICIPATE-NASH and whether model predictions differed in F3/F4 patients. Results were validated in cohort 2 (1396 F3-F4 patients) from 4 clinical trials using the clinical regulatory end point. In cohort 1, F3 and F4 were equally distributed. There were 56 LREs (8.0%) during follow-up, concentrated in F4 (51 LREs). The ANTICIPATE-NASH model showed excellent discrimination (C statistic, 0.93) for LRE, higher than histology (C statistic, 0.67). Model calibration was excellent. Adding histology did not improve model prediction. Thresholds of ANTICIPATE-NASH above which F3 patients developed LREs and below which F4 patients did not were identified. Results were reproduced in cohort 2 with the regulatory end point, with higher model discrimination (C statistic, 0.84) compared with histology (C statistic, 0.64). In MASLD patients with F3/F4, the noninvasive ANTICIPATE-NASH models provide better risk stratification of clinical events than histologic classification. These models could be very useful for clinical trials by selecting patients at risk of clinical events and patients with higher chances of observed cirrhosis regression.",

Lifestyle interventions produce benefits, but with limited sustainability. To determine whether a 6-month habit-based lifestyle program adds benefit to education and activity monitoring for sustained MetS remission at 24 months. The Enhancing Lifestyles in Metabolic Syndrome (ELM) study was a single-blind, individually randomized clinical trial of participants with MetS recruited from July 2019 to January 2022 at 5 locations in the US and followed up for 24 months. Eligible participants were motivated for lifestyle change and were contacted using electronic medical records and social or mass media; those who did not meet medical or logistical criteria were excluded. In all, 14 817 adults were screened during a 2.5 year period. Data were analyzed from March 2024 to May 2025. All participants received education and an activity monitor. Those in the intervention group also received 19 small group in-person meetings during 6 months, which sought to establish the following habits as part of their daily routine: vegetables at meals, brisk walks, sensory awareness, and emotion regulation. Repetition of these habits was encouraged by attention to participants' experience of immediate benefits and peer support. The comparator group received 24 evidence-based educational mailings monthly during the 24 months. MetS remission at 24 months determined by blinded laboratory evaluation and clinical examination. Secondary outcomes were cardiometabolic and lifestyle risk factors at 6 and 24 months.

      "abstract": "Obesity is a complex chronic condition linked to various comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidaemia, with a significant global burden. Standard treatments, such as diet, exercise and behavioural changes, often have limited effects and poor compliance. Pharmacological options, including glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) dual agonists, show promise for individuals with obesity. This is one of three reviews investigating different GIP/GLP1-RAs for adults living with obesity. To assess the effects of the dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, tirzepatide, for adults living with obesity. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and two trials registries on 17 December 2024. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with obesity that compared tirzepatide at any dose with placebo, structured lifestyle modification programmes, another anti-obesity medication or other GLP-1RAs or GIP/GLP-1RAs, with a minimum follow-up of six months. Critical outcomes were weight, adverse events, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), quality of life, and mortality. Important outcomes included waist circumference and other obesity-related comorbidities. We used the original version of the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias (RoB 1). We synthesised results for each outcome using meta-analysis with a random-effects model. Where this was not possible, we described the results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. The main comparison of interest in the review is tirzepatide versus placebo. We included nine RCTs with 7111 participants, aged 36.1 to 65.25 years, primarily from middle- and high-income countries. The main comparison, tirzepatide versus placebo, is based on eight studies; one study compared tirzepatide with semaglutide. Studies included participants with weight-related comorbidities. Seven studies focused on specific subgroups, including type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, chronic heart failure, obstructive sleep apnoea (after a long pretreatment phase), and different racial populations. Tirzepatide was injected once a week, with dosing ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg. All the studies had medium-term follow-ups, and one had a long-term follow-up. All nine studies reported a major role of the drug manufacturer in their design, conduct, analysis, or writing. Tirzepatide versus placebo (medium-term: 12 to 18 months) Tirzepatide likely results in a greater percentage reduction in body weight from baseline (mean difference (MD) -16.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) -18.91 to -13.14; 8 studies, 6317 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and an increase in the number of people achieving a 5% weight reduction (risk ratio (RR) 3.60, 95% CI 2.44 to 5.30; I2 = 86%; 5 studies, 4455 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide may result in an increase in non-serious adverse events (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.71; 5 studies, 4582 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect on serious adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12; 8 studies, 6359 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide may result in little to no difference in adverse events leading to withdrawal (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.52; 8 studies, 6359 participants; low-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide likely results in little to no difference in MACE (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.66; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 5628 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide likely results in little to no clinically important difference in quality of life as measured by the IWQOL-Lite-CT physical function domain (MD 9.91, 95% CI 7.81 to 12.02; 6 studies, 5020 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide likely results in little to no difference in mortality (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.83; 7 studies, 5628 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide versus placebo (long-term: 3.5 years) Tirzepatide likely results in a greater percentage reduction in body weight from baseline (MD -15.66, 95% CI -19.14 to -12.18; 1 study, 1032 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and an increase in the number of people achieving a 5% weight reduction (RR 2.81, 95% CI 2.33 to 3.38; 1 study, 1032 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide may result in an increase in non-serious adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.11; 1 study, 1032 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect on serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.65; 1 study, 1032 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide may result in little to no difference in adverse events leading to withdrawal (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.76; 1 study, 1032 participants; low-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide likely results in little to no difference in MACE (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.42; 1 study, 1032 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide may result in little to no clinically important difference in quality of life as measured by SF-36 physical component score (MD 2.70, 95% CI 0.00 to 5.40; 1 study, 1032 participants; low-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide may result in little to no difference in mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.17; 1 study, 1032 participants; low-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide likely results in weight loss at medium-term follow-up, and this initial weight loss is likely to be sustained at longer-term follow-up. The long-term impact on other patient-important outcomes may be limited or uncertain. The certainty of the evidence on events leading to withdrawal at medium- and long-term follow-up is low, which might further limit our understanding of the sustainability of the initial effects. All the included studies were funded by the drug manufacturer, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Further independent studies are needed, particularly in underrepresented populations, to better understand the broader effects of tirzepatide in the management of obesity.

Seven studies focused on specific subgroups, including type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, chronic heart failure, obstructive sleep apnoea (after a long pretreatment phase), and different racial populations. Tirzepatide was injected once a week, with dosing ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg. All the studies had medium-term follow-ups, and one had a long-term follow-up.

Tirzepatide may result in an increase in non-serious adverse events (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.71; 5 studies, 4582 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect on serious adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12; 8 studies, 6359 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide may result in little to no difference in adverse events leading to withdrawal (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.52; 8 studies, 6359 participants; low-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide likely results in little to no difference in MACE (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.66; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 5628 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Tirzepatide likely results in little to no difference in mortality (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.83; 7 studies, 5628 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide versus placebo (long-term: 3.5 years) Tirzepatide likely results in a greater percentage reduction in body weight from baseline (MD -15.66, 95% CI -19.14 to -12.18; 1 study, 1032 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and an increase in the number of people achieving a 5% weight reduction (RR 2.81, 95% CI 2.33 to 3.38; 1 study, 1032 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide may result in an increase in non-serious adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.11; 1 study, 1032 participants; low-certainty evidence).

The long-term impact on other patient-important outcomes may be limited or uncertain. The certainty of the evidence on events leading to withdrawal at medium- and long-term follow-up is low, which might further limit our understanding of the sustainability of the initial effects. All the included studies were funded by the drug manufacturer, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Further independent studies are needed, particularly in underrepresented populations, to better understand the broader effects of tirzepatide in the management of obesity."

The efficacy and safety of olezarsen, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting apolipoprotein C-III messenger RNA, have not been established in this population. We conducted two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (CORE-TIMI 72a and CORE2-TIMI 72b). Patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia were assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive olezarsen at a dose of 50 mg, olezarsen at a dose of 80 mg, or placebo monthly for 12 months. The primary outcome was the percent change from baseline in the triglyceride level at 6 months, reported as the difference between each olezarsen dose group and the placebo group (placebo-adjusted change). Secondary lipid outcomes included the percent change from baseline in the triglyceride level at 12 months and in the levels of apolipoprotein C-III, remnant cholesterol, and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol at 6 months and 12 months. Acute pancreatitis events were assessed across both trials. A total of 1061 patients were included in the primary analysis (617 in the CORE-TIMI 72a trial and 444 in the CORE2-TIMI 72b trial). At 6 months, the placebo-adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline in the triglyceride level was -62.9 percentage points in the olezarsen 50-mg group and -72.2 percentage points in the olezarsen 80-mg group in the CORE-TIMI 72a trial and was -49.2 percentage points in the olezarsen 50-mg group and -54.5 percentage points in the olezarsen 80-mg group in the CORE2-TIMI 72b trial (P<0.001 for all comparisons of olezarsen with placebo). Decreases in the levels of triglycerides, apolipoprotein C-III, remnant cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol were greater with olezarsen than with placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons). The incidence of acute pancreatitis was lower with olezarsen than with placebo (mean rate ratio, 0.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.40; P<0.001). The incidence of any adverse events appeared to be similar across trial groups. Elevations in liver-enzyme levels and thrombocytopenia (platelet count, <100,000 per microliter) were more common with the 80-mg dose of olezarsen, and a dose-dependent increase in the hepatic fat fraction was noted. Among patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, treatment with olezarsen led to a significantly greater reduction in the triglyceride level at 6 months and in the incidence of acute pancreatitis than placebo.

We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving adults and adolescents (≥12 years of age) with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, as defined by all the following: a total body-surface area of psoriasis involvement of at least 10%, a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of at least 12 (range, 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating a greater extent or severity of psoriasis), and an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of at least 3 (range, 0 [clear skin] to 4 [severe disease]). Participants were assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive icotrokinra at a dose of 200 mg once daily through week 24 or placebo through week 16 followed by transition to icotrokinra. The coprimary end points were an IGA 0/1 response (IGA score of 0 or 1 with ≥2-point reduction from baseline) and a PASI 90 response (≥90% reduction from baseline in the PASI score) at week 16. A total of 684 participants underwent randomization (456 to the icotrokinra group and 228 to the placebo group). At week 16, a total of 65% of the participants receiving icotrokinra and 8% of those receiving placebo had an IGA 0/1 response, and 50% and 4%, respectively, had a PASI 90 response (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Complete clearance of skin at week 16 was significantly more likely with icotrokinra than with placebo (IGA score of 0, 33% vs. 1%; PASI 100 response [100% reduction from baseline in the PASI score], 27% vs. <1%; P<0.001 for both comparisons). The percentage of participants with at least one adverse event through week 16 was 49% in each group; the most common adverse events in each group were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection. The exposure-adjusted incidence of adverse events was consistent through week 24. Selective blockade of the interleukin-23 receptor with the targeted oral peptide icotrokinra resulted in a significantly higher incidence of skin clearance at week 16 than placebo among adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

      "abstract": "A total of 37.3 million Americans have diabetes, and 96 million more have prediabetes. Hyperglycemia, the hallmark of diabetes, increases the risk for diabetes-related complications, including skin breakdown and cardiovascular disease. Many clinical practice guidelines exist, but there are gaps regarding the best approaches to assess physical fitness and mobility in adults with diabetes; incorporate exercise into the care plan; and reload the diabetic foot after ulcer closure has occurred to avoid ulcer reoccurrence. The purpose of this clinical practice guideline was to review and assess previously published guidelines and address gaps within the guidelines specific to the following: best screening tools/tests and interventions to prevent a future reulceration, best screening tools and interventions to assess and address mobility impairments, best tools to measure and interventions to address reduced physical fitness and activity, best approach to reloading the foot after ulceration closure and, finally, whether improvement in physical fitness will positively change quality of life and health care costs. The Guidelines Development Group performed a systematic literature search and review of the literature. A total of 701 studies were identified. Following duplicate removal and exclusion for irrelevance, 125 studies underwent full-text review, and 38 studies were included. Recommendations were developed using a software assistant created specifically for guideline recommendation development. Recommendations resulted for physical fitness and activity inclusion and measurement for adults with diabetes and with or without foot ulceration. Exercise and physical activity should be prescribed according to the physiologic response of an adult with diabetes to exercise and preferences for optimizing long-term quality of life and reduce health care costs. Reloading following diabetic foot ulcer closure should include maximal offloading, especially during the first 3 months; loading should be titrated using a footwear schedule. Further research is necessary in the areas of exercise in the wound healing process and the assessment of methods to reload a newly reepithelialized ulcer to prevent recurrence.",

Data were pooled using a random-effects model. The primary outcome was the incidence of suicide attempts. Interventions were grouped by presence or absence of a narrative assessment component. Twenty-three studies with 3262 participants met inclusion criteria. CBT interventions including a narrative assessment were associated with a significantly reduced risk of suicide attempt compared with controls (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.87; 1764 participants across 14 studies), whereas CBT interventions without this component were not associated with risk of suicide attempt (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.63-2.20; 1498 participants across 9 studies). Subgroup comparison indicated a significant difference between groups (Q1 = 7.27; P = .007; I2 = 86%). Studies without a narrative assessment had significantly younger participants, a lower event rate, and slightly higher risk of bias. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, CBT interventions including a narrative assessment were associated with a reduced risk of suicide attempt, while CBT without this component did not have an association with risk of suicide attempt. Age differences between study populations may partly explain this finding, as interventions in younger populations often show smaller and more inconsistent effect sizes. These results suggest that a narrative assessment may be a simple and effective way to capture the forces that lead to suicide attempts and to direct interventions toward their prevention.

Nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) influenza vaccines have shown promising immunogenicity against influenza and an acceptable safety profile in a phase 1-2 trial. In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years to receive either a quadrivalent modRNA influenza vaccine (modRNA group) or a licensed inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (control group) during the 2022-2023 influenza season in the United States, South Africa, and the Philippines. The primary end point was relative efficacy, defined by the reduction in the percentage of participants with laboratory-confirmed influenza associated with influenza-like illness at least 14 days after vaccination with the modRNA vaccine, as compared with the control vaccine, and analyzed for noninferiority and superiority. Immunogenicity was evaluated by means of a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay. We assessed reactogenicity within 7 days after vaccination, adverse events through 1 month, and serious adverse events through 6 months. We assessed vaccine efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety in the modRNA group. A total of 18,476 participants underwent randomization: 9225 were assigned to receive the modRNA vaccine and 9251 to receive the control vaccine. The relative efficacy of the modRNA vaccine as compared with the control vaccine against influenza-like illness was 34.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.4 to 53.9) on the basis of 57 cases in the modRNA group and 87 cases in the control group, a finding that met the criteria for both noninferiority and superiority. Cases of influenza-like illness were caused by A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains but almost no B strains. The noninferiority of the antibody response on HAI assay was shown for influenza A strains but not for B strains. Primarily mild or moderate reactogenicity was observed in both vaccine groups but was reported more frequently in the modRNA group (overall local reactions, 70.1% vs. 43.1%; overall systemic events, 65.8% vs. 48.7%). Fever occurred in 5.6% of the participants in the modRNA group and in 1.7% of those in the control group. Adverse event profiles were similar in the two groups. The modRNA vaccine had statistically superior efficacy over the control vaccine, with greater immune responses to A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 strains, but was associated with more reactogenicity events.

Data sources for this study were PubMed, PEDro, Google Scholar, and EBSCO from inception until February 9, 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of aerobic exercise in patients with a clinical diagnosis of fibromyalgia were included. Outcome measures were pain intensity (Visual Analog Scale) and health status (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ)). The dose-response relationship was evaluated using a restricted cubic spline model. Twenty-three RCTs were included. The meta-analysis showed a significant improvement in pain intensity and functional status. A minimum dose of 50 min per week standardized mean difference (SMD = -0.67; 95% CI = -0.70 to -0.65) and a total duration of 600 min (SMD = -0.65; 95% CI = -0.69 to -0.62) were estimated to effectively reduce pain intensity. The maximum effect was achieved with 90 min per week (SMD = -1.14; 95% CI = -1.19 to -1.09) and 1200 min total duration (SMD = -1.08; 95%CI = -1.13 to -1.02). Additionally, a minimum dose of 65 min per week (SMD = -0.62; 95% CI = -0.6 to -0.69) and a total duration of 950 min (SMD = -0.61; 95% CI = -0.60 to -0.67) were estimated to effectively reduce the FIQ score. While the maximum effect was obtained with 150 min per week (SMD = -1.77; 95% CI = -1.89 to -1.65) and 3000 min of total duration (SMD = -1.43; 95% CI = -1.54 to -1.31). These findings may be useful in optimizing the minimal dose of aerobic exercise to achieve health improvements in people with fibromyalgia.",

      "abstract": "Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) is associated with a significant risk of mortality, rehospitalisation, and angina burden. Despite its clinical impact, no randomized clinical trials have hitherto evaluated optimal management strategy for MINOCA. The PROMISE trial was designed to assess whether a stratified treatment improves clinical outcomes in patients with MINOCA as compared to standard care. PROMISE is a multicentre randomised trial. Patients with MINOCA were randomised 1:1 to either a stratified treatment based on a comprehensive diagnostic workup aimed at identifying the underlying aetiology, or to standard care. The primary endpoint was the between-group difference in the change in angina status at 12 months, assessed by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire summary score (SAQSS). The secondary endpoint was the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as the composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure hospitalization and repeated coronary angiography. The trial was terminated early upon recommendation by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board due to clear benefits observed in the intervention group and potential harm in the control group. Of 101 randomized patients, 92 were confirmed as MINOCA and included in the final analysis (mean age 62±13 years, 48% women; stratified treatment n=45; standard care n=47). At 12-month follow-up, SAQSS was significantly higher in the stratified treatment than in standard care group, with a mean between-group difference of +9.38 in favour of the stratified treatment (95% confidence interval 6.81 to 11.95; p<0.001). MACE occurred in 1 patient (2.2%) in the stratified treatment and in 4 patients (8.5%) in the standard care group, though the difference was not statistically significant (p= 0.18). In this first randomized trial of treatment strategies in MINOCA, a stratified treatment, based on comprehensive diagnostic assessment and aetiology-guided therapy, led to a significant improvement in angina-related health status. While the study findings provide the first evidence supporting individualized management in this heterogeneous and often under-recognized patient population, these results require confirmation in a larger prospective study with longer follow-up.",

Randomized controlled trials of metformin started before conception and continued at least until a positive pregnancy test compared with either placebo or no treatment in women with polycystic ovary syndrome were included. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the following key outcomes: miscarriage (primary) and clinical pregnancy and live birth (secondary). The studies were assessed for quality using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Indirect comparisons were performed for all key outcomes on the timing of metformin treatment using the Bucher technique. A total of 12 trustworthy studies (involving 1708 women) were included in the meta-analysis, all of which were graded low to moderate quality. Women who received preconception metformin that was continued throughout the first trimester of pregnancy showed higher clinical pregnancy rates (odds ratio, 1.57 [95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.23]), a possible reduction in miscarriage (odds ratio, 0.64 [95% confidence interval, 0.32-1.25]), and possible increase in live birth (odds ratio, 1.24 [95% confidence interval, 0.59-2.61]) than women who received either a placebo or no treatment. Women who stopped metformin once pregnant not only had an increase in clinical pregnancy rate (odds ratio, 1.35 [95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.80]) but also had an indication of an increase in miscarriage rate (odds ratio, 1.46 [95% confidence interval, 0.73-2.90]) compared with those who received a placebo or no treatment. Indirect comparisons between metformin continued through the first trimester of pregnancy and metformin stopped once pregnant consistently demonstrated a trend favoring the continuation of metformin: clinical pregnancy odds ratio of 1.16 (95% confidence interval, 0.74-1.83), miscarriage odds ratio of 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 0.17-1.16), and live birth odds ratio of 1.14 (95% confidence interval, 0.41-3.13). Continuing metformin treatment throughout the first trimester of pregnancy may reduce the risk of miscarriage and increase live birth rates in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

      "abstract": "Obesity is a complex chronic condition linked to various comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidaemia, with a significant global burden. Standard treatments, such as diet, exercise and behavioural changes, often have limited effects and poor compliance. Pharmacological options, including glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) dual agonists, show promise for individuals with obesity. This is one of three reviews investigating different GIP/GLP1-RAs for adults living with obesity. To assess the effects of the dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, tirzepatide, for adults living with obesity. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and two trials registries on 17 December 2024. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adults with obesity that compared tirzepatide at any dose with placebo, structured lifestyle modification programmes, another anti-obesity medication or other GLP-1RAs or GIP/GLP-1RAs, with a minimum follow-up of six months. Critical outcomes were weight, adverse events, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), quality of life, and mortality. Important outcomes included waist circumference and other obesity-related comorbidities. We used the original version of the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias (RoB 1). We synthesised results for each outcome using meta-analysis with a random-effects model. Where this was not possible, we described the results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. The main comparison of interest in the review is tirzepatide versus placebo. We included nine RCTs with 7111 participants, aged 36.1 to 65.25 years, primarily from middle- and high-income countries. The main comparison, tirzepatide versus placebo, is based on eight studies; one study compared tirzepatide with semaglutide. Studies included participants with weight-related comorbidities. Seven studies focused on specific subgroups, including type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, chronic heart failure, obstructive sleep apnoea (after a long pretreatment phase), and different racial populations. Tirzepatide was injected once a week, with dosing ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg. All the studies had medium-term follow-ups, and one had a long-term follow-up. All nine studies reported a major role of the drug manufacturer in their design, conduct, analysis, or writing. Tirzepatide versus placebo (medium-term: 12 to 18 months) Tirzepatide likely results in a greater percentage reduction in body weight from baseline (mean difference (MD) -16.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) -18.91 to -13.14; 8 studies, 6317 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and an increase in the number of people achieving a 5% weight reduction (risk ratio (RR) 3.60, 95% CI 2.44 to 5.30; I2 = 86%; 5 studies, 4455 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide may result in an increase in non-serious adverse events (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.71; 5 studies, 4582 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect on serious adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12; 8 studies, 6359 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide may result in little to no difference in adverse events leading to withdrawal (RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.52; 8 studies, 6359 participants; low-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide likely results in little to no difference in MACE (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.66; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 5628 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide likely results in little to no clinically important difference in quality of life as measured by the IWQOL-Lite-CT physical function domain (MD 9.91, 95% CI 7.81 to 12.02; 6 studies, 5020 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide likely results in little to no difference in mortality (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.83; 7 studies, 5628 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide versus placebo (long-term: 3.5 years) Tirzepatide likely results in a greater percentage reduction in body weight from baseline (MD -15.66, 95% CI -19.14 to -12.18; 1 study, 1032 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and an increase in the number of people achieving a 5% weight reduction (RR 2.81, 95% CI 2.33 to 3.38; 1 study, 1032 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide may result in an increase in non-serious adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.11; 1 study, 1032 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect on serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.65; 1 study, 1032 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide may result in little to no difference in adverse events leading to withdrawal (RR 1.64, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.76; 1 study, 1032 participants; low-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide likely results in little to no difference in MACE (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.42; 1 study, 1032 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide may result in little to no clinically important difference in quality of life as measured by SF-36 physical component score (MD 2.70, 95% CI 0.00 to 5.40; 1 study, 1032 participants; low-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide may result in little to no difference in mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.17; 1 study, 1032 participants; low-certainty evidence). Tirzepatide likely results in weight loss at medium-term follow-up, and this initial weight loss is likely to be sustained at longer-term follow-up. The long-term impact on other patient-important outcomes may be limited or uncertain. The certainty of the evidence on events leading to withdrawal at medium- and long-term follow-up is low, which might further limit our understanding of the sustainability of the initial effects. All the included studies were funded by the drug manufacturer, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Further independent studies are needed, particularly in underrepresented populations, to better understand the broader effects of tirzepatide in the management of obesity.

Many patients with HeFH do not achieve guideline-recommended LDL-C goals with the currently available lipid-lowering therapies. To evaluate the efficacy of enlicitide decanoate (an oral proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor) vs placebo in adults with HeFH requiring further lowering of LDL-C levels despite use of statin therapy. This phase 3, randomized clinical trial included persons aged 18 years or older with HeFH currently using lipid-lowering therapy (taking at least a moderate- or high-intensity statin) and either an LDL-C level of 55 mg/dL or greater and a history of major atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or an LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL or greater without a history of major atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The trial was conducted at 59 sites across 17 countries; the first participant was screened on August 8, 2023, and the last follow-up visit occurred on April 7, 2025. Participants were randomized (2:1) to 20 mg of enlicitide (n = 202) or placebo (n = 101) once daily for 52 weeks. The primary outcome was the mean percentage change in LDL-C level at week 24. The secondary outcomes included the mean percentage change in LDL-C level at week 52, the mean percentage change at week 24 in levels of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein B, and the median percentage change at week 24 in lipoprotein(a). Of the 303 participants (mean age, 52.4 [SD, 13.5] years; 51% were female) randomized, 293 (96.7%) completed the trial. The mean LDL-C level was 119.0 mg/dL (SD, 41.0 mg/dL) at baseline, all had statin current use (81.5% were taking a high-intensity statin), and 64.4% were taking ezetimibe. The mean percentage change in LDL-C level at week 24 was -58.2% in the enlicitide group vs 2.6% in the placebo group (between-group difference, -59.4% [95% CI, -65.6% to -53.2%]; P < .001). The mean percentage change in LDL-C level at week 52 was -55.3% in the enlicitide group vs 8.7% in the placebo group (between-group difference, -61.5% [95% CI, -69.4% to -53.7%]; P < .001). At week 24, the mean percentage change in non-HDL-C level was -52.3% in the enlicitide group vs 2.1% in the placebo group (between-group difference, -53.0% [95% CI, -58.5% to -47.4%]; P < .001), the mean percentage change in apolipoprotein B level was -48.2% vs 1.8%, respectively (between-group difference, -49.1% [95% CI, -54.0% to -44.3%]; P < .001), and the median percentage change in lipoprotein(a) level was -24.7% vs -1.6% (between-group difference, -27.5% [95% CI, -34.3% to -20.6%]; P < .001). The incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, and study discontinuation due to adverse events was similar between groups.

Coffee is the most commonly consumed caffeinated beverage in the US, and a randomized trial assessing caffeinated coffee consumption in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) has not previously been performed. To determine the effect of caffeinated coffee consumption compared with abstinence from coffee and caffeine on recurrent AF. This was a prospective, open-label, randomized clinical trial enrolling 200 current or previous (within past 5 years) coffee-drinking adults with persistent AF, or atrial flutter with a history of AF, planned for electrical cardioversion from 5 hospitals in the US, Canada, and Australia between November 2021 and December 2024. The date of final follow-up was June 5, 2025. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to regular caffeinated coffee consumption vs coffee and caffeine abstinence for 6 months. Patients in the coffee consumption group were encouraged to drink at least 1 cup of caffeinated coffee daily. Patients in the abstinence group were encouraged to completely abstain from both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee and other caffeine-containing products. The primary end point was clinically detected recurrence of AF or atrial flutter over 6 months. Two hundred patients (mean [SD] age, 69 [11] years; 71% male) were randomized to caffeinated coffee consumption (n = 100) or coffee abstinence (n = 100). Baseline coffee intake was 7 cups (IQR, 7-18) per week in both groups. During follow-up, coffee intake in the consumption and abstinence groups was 7 (IQR, 6-11) and 0 (IQR, 0-2) cups per week, respectively, resulting in a between-group difference of 7 cups (95% CI, 7-7) per week. In the primary analysis, AF or atrial flutter recurrence was less in the coffee consumption (47%) than the coffee abstinence (64%) group, resulting in a 39% lower hazard of recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.42-0.89]; P = .01). A comparable benefit of coffee consumption was observed with AF recurrence only. There was no significant difference in adverse events. In this clinical trial of coffee drinkers after successful cardioversion, allocation to consumption of caffeinated coffee averaging 1 cup a day was associated with less recurrence of AF or atrial flutter compared with abstinence from coffee and caffeinated products.

Since universal follow-up is not feasible, identifying for whom and when outpatient follow-up is most beneficial is essential for optimizing resources and reducing readmissions. To quantify the association between outpatient follow-up within 30, 14, and 7 days postdischarge and 30-day all-cause readmissions and assess differences in outcomes by disease, age, and baseline readmission risk. MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, and CINAHL were searched for studies published between January 1, 2000, and August 4, 2025, using terms related to outpatient follow-up and readmissions. English-language studies assessing the association between outpatient follow-up within 30 days of hospital discharge and 30-day all-cause readmissions among adult inpatients were included. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses guidelines, 2 reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts. Data were extracted by 1 author and verified by another, and quality assessment was done independently by 2 authors. The primary outcome was all-cause 30-day readmission. Secondary outcomes included all-cause 30-day emergency department (ED) discharge and mortality. Pooled effect sizes (relative risk ratios [RRRs]) were estimated by disease and age group using multilevel random-effects models. Eighty-three studies were included in the review and 76 in the meta-analysis. Outpatient follow-up within 30 days vs no follow-up was associated with a reduction in risk of 30-day all-cause readmission (RRR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.60-0.75), with less reduction (RRR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67-0.89) when restricted to studies with low to moderate risk of bias (ROB). Among patients with heart failure (HF) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the RRRs for 30-day follow-up in studies with low to moderate ROB were 0.65 (95% CI, 0.48-0.83) and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.32-0.80), respectively.

Endoscopic surveillance has been proposed for early detection of BE-related neoplasia and reducing EAC mortality. This clinical practice guideline aims to inform clinicians and patients by providing evidence-based practice recommendations for surveillance in patients with BE. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to assess evidence and make recommendations. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients, conducted an evidence review, and used the Evidence-to-Decision Framework to develop recommendations regarding the role of endoscopic surveillance in patients with BE. The clinical domains addressed included: (1) overall role of endoscopic surveillance, (2) surveillance in patients with columnar-lined esophagus <1 cm, (3) optimal imaging modalities, (4) adjunctive sampling techniques, (5) the utility of biomarkers in risk-stratification, (6) chemopreventive strategies, and (7) antireflux procedures in the prevention of progression in patients with BE. Clinical recommendations were based on the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations. The panel agreed on 8 recommendations. Based on the available evidence, the panel provided a conditional recommendation in favor of surveillance for patients with nondysplastic BE. In patients with columnar-lined esophagus <1 cm, a conditional recommendation was made against endoscopic surveillance. The panel made a strong recommendation in favor of a combination of high-definition white light endoscopy and chromoendoscopy compared with white light endoscopy alone. The panel made no recommendation on the use of enhanced sampling techniques, such as wide-area transepithelial sampling to enhance neoplasia detection and biomarkers such as p53 and TissueCypher to predict progression in BE. The panel provided a conditional recommendation for the use of daily proton pump inhibitor therapy compared with no therapy and compared with antireflux surgery to prevent progression in BE. This document provides a comprehensive outline on the role of surveillance in patients with BE. Key implementation statements included in this document stress the importance of a high-quality endoscopy examination, sampling using a structured biopsy protocol, and confirming the diagnosis of BE-related neoplasia by an expert pathologist. This document also provides guidance on surveillance intervals and management of patients with BE-related low-grade dysplasia and indefinite for dysplasia. Providers should engage in shared decision making based on patient preferences. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted to guide future research opportunities. This guideline is endorsed by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology.",

The clinical domains addressed included: (1) overall role of endoscopic surveillance, (2) surveillance in patients with columnar-lined esophagus <1 cm, (3) optimal imaging modalities, (4) adjunctive sampling techniques, (5) the utility of biomarkers in risk-stratification, (6) chemopreventive strategies, and (7) antireflux procedures in the prevention of progression in patients with BE. Clinical recommendations were based on the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations."

The panel made no recommendation on the use of enhanced sampling techniques, such as wide-area transepithelial sampling to enhance neoplasia detection and biomarkers such as p53 and TissueCypher to predict progression in BE. The panel provided a conditional recommendation for the use of daily proton pump inhibitor therapy compared with no therapy and compared with antireflux surgery to prevent progression in BE."

      "abstract": "Reduced circulating estrogen levels around the time of menopause can induce symptoms that affect health and well-being. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment, but may be associated with some adverse health outcomes, including endometrial pathology. This is an update of a review first published in 1999 and last updated in 2012. • To assess the effects of hormone therapy regimens for protecting postmenopausal women against endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer. • To define the lowest effective dose(s) of progestogen used in combination with estrogen therapy for protecting the endometrium. We searched for trials in the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group specialized register, CENTRAL (containing output from two trial registers and CINAHL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to 22 July 2024. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. Interventions of interest were unopposed estrogen, continuous combined estrogen and progestogen, and sequential combined estrogen and progestogen, administered for at least one year. These interventions could be compared head to head or with placebo. Trials had to report rates of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer (histologic diagnosis). Our critical outcomes were endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer at one year and after one year. Our important outcomes were adherence to therapy, requirement for additional interventions, and withdrawal due to adverse events. We used the original Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 1). Where meta-analysis was possible, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. This update included 72 studies (involving 40,652 women) conducted worldwide. There were 42 multicenter trials. There were too few studies with events to draw conclusions about endometrial cancer. The results for endometrial hyperplasia are presented below. Unopposed estrogen versus placebo Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with placebo (22-43 events/1000 women versus 5 events/1000 women; OR 5.86, 95% CI 4.09 to 8.40; I² = 0%; 6 RCTs, 2493 women; moderate-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia after one year (40-68 events/1000 women versus 6 events/1000 women; OR 8.97, 95% CI 6.78 to 11.87; I² = 49%; 9 RCTs, 2539 women; moderate-certainty-evidence). Continuous combined estrogen plus progestogen versus placebo Continuous combined therapy may have little to no effect on the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with placebo (0-16 events/1000 women versus 5 events/1000 women; OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.08 to 3.38; I² = 48%; 4 RCTs, 3893 women; low-certainty-evidence). We are unsure about the effect of continuous combined therapy after one year (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.40; I² = 47%; 4 RCTs, 789 women; very low-certainty evidence). Sequential combined estrogen plus progestogen versus placebo Sequential combined therapy may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with placebo (6-27 events/1000 women versus 2 events/1000 women; OR 5.53, 95% CI 2.60 to 11.76; I² = 0%; 4 RCTs, 1030 women; low-certainty-evidence). Sequential combined therapy may result in little to no difference in the risk of endometrial hyperplasia after one year (16-97 events/1000 women versus 20 events/1000 women; OR 2.30, 95% CI 0.76 to 6.99; I² = 0%; 3 RCTs, 534 women; low-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen versus continuous combined estrogen plus progestogen Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with continuous combined therapy (46-75 events/1000 women versus 3 events /1000 women; OR 21.90, 95% CI 16.76 to 28.62; I² = 53%; 11 RCTs, 7856 women; moderate-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia after one year compared with continuous combined therapy (33-73 events/1000 women versus 3 events/1000 women; OR 16.78, 95% CI 11.01 to 25.55; I² = 69%; 3 RCTs, 1191 women; moderate-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen versus sequential combined estrogen plus progestogen Unopposed estrogen may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with sequential combined therapy (156-301 events/1000 women versus 16 events/1000 women; OR 17.19, 95% CI 11.27 to 26.22; I² = 70%; 5 RCTs, 2354 women; low-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia after one year compared with sequential combined treatment (379-612 events/1000 women versus 49 events/1000 women; OR 19.21, 95% CI 11.95 to 30.90; I² = 15%; 2 RCTs, 417 women; low-certainty-evidence). Continuous combined estrogen plus progestogen versus sequential combined estrogen plus progestogen All analyses had insufficient events to draw conclusions. Continuous combined estrogen plus progestogen - dose comparisons We are unsure about the effect of moderate-dose estrogen plus low-dose progestogen compared with moderate-dose estrogen plus moderate-dose progestogen on the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.24 to 5.84; I² = 36%; 2 RCTs, 2363 women; very low-certainty-evidence). The remaining dose comparisons had insufficient events to draw conclusions. Sequential combined estrogen plus progestogen - dose comparisons Moderate-dose estrogen plus low-dose progestogen may result in little to no difference in the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with moderate-dose estrogen plus moderate-dose progestogen (3-32 events/1000 women versus 6 events/1000 women; OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.49 to 5.65; I² = 0%; 4 RCTs, 1072 women; low-certainty-evidence). The remaining dose comparisons had insufficient events to draw conclusions. Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia versus placebo and continuous combined therapy at one year and later. Sequential combined therapy may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year versus placebo. The evidence is less certain for continuous versus sequential combined regimens and dose comparisons of continuous and sequential combined regimens. The trials had few events, and long-term follow-up was challenging. For endometrial cancer, events were rare and trials were underpowered to draw meaningful conclusions.

Unopposed estrogen versus continuous combined estrogen plus progestogen Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with continuous combined therapy (46-75 events/1000 women versus 3 events /1000 women; OR 21.90, 95% CI 16.76 to 28.62; I² = 53%; 11 RCTs, 7856 women; moderate-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia after one year compared with continuous combined therapy (33-73 events/1000 women versus 3 events/1000 women; OR 16.78, 95% CI 11.01 to 25.55; I² = 69%; 3 RCTs, 1191 women; moderate-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen versus sequential combined estrogen plus progestogen Unopposed estrogen may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with sequential combined therapy (156-301 events/1000 women versus 16 events/1000 women; OR 17.19, 95% CI 11.27 to 26.22; I² = 70%; 5 RCTs, 2354 women; low-certainty-evidence). Unopposed estrogen may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia after one year compared with sequential combined treatment (379-612 events/1000 women versus 49 events/1000 women; OR 19.21, 95% CI 11.95 to 30.90; I² = 15%; 2 RCTs, 417 women; low-certainty-evidence). Continuous combined estrogen plus progestogen versus sequential combined estrogen plus progestogen All analyses had insufficient events to draw conclusions. Continuous combined estrogen plus progestogen - dose comparisons We are unsure about the effect of moderate-dose estrogen plus low-dose progestogen compared with moderate-dose estrogen plus moderate-dose progestogen on the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.24 to 5.84; I² = 36%; 2 RCTs, 2363 women; very low-certainty-evidence). The remaining dose comparisons had insufficient events to draw conclusions. Sequential combined estrogen plus progestogen - dose comparisons Moderate-dose estrogen plus low-dose progestogen may result in little to no difference in the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year compared with moderate-dose estrogen plus moderate-dose progestogen (3-32 events/1000 women versus 6 events/1000 women; OR 1.66, 95% CI 0.49 to 5.65; I² = 0%; 4 RCTs, 1072 women; low-certainty-evidence). The remaining dose comparisons had insufficient events to draw conclusions."

          "text": "Unopposed estrogen probably increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia versus placebo and continuous combined therapy at one year and later. Sequential combined therapy may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia at one year versus placebo. The evidence is less certain for continuous versus sequential combined regimens and dose comparisons of continuous and sequential combined regimens. The trials had few events, and long-term follow-up was challenging. For endometrial cancer, events were rare and trials were underpowered to draw meaningful conclusions."

      "abstract": "The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan lowered blood pressure (BP) among Black adults in a controlled environment, but to date, there are no grocery shopping strategies that replicated its health effects in a community setting. The Groceries for Black Residents of Boston to Stop Hypertension (GoFresh) trial was conducted to determine the effects of low sodium-DASH groceries on systolic BP. This parallel-group randomized clinical trial was conducted in Boston from August 2022 to September 2025 among Black residents of urban communities with few grocery stores, a systolic BP of 120 to less than 150 mm Hg, a diastolic BP less than 100 mm Hg, and no hypertension treatment. Data were analyzed from June through October 2025. Participants were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of home-delivered, DASH-patterned groceries ordered weekly with dietitian counseling without emphasizing cost or three $500 stipends every 4 weeks intended for self-directed grocery shopping. The primary comparison was the difference in the 3-month change in model-estimated office systolic BP (based on 3 measurements over at least 2 visits) between interventions. Adherence was assessed via 24-hour urine collection. Secondary outcomes included diastolic BP, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c levels, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Maintenance of effects was assessed 3 months after intervention cessation. Among 180 participants, (mean [SD] age, 46.1 [13.3] years; 102 female [56.7%]; 180 self-reported Black [100%]; 12 Hispanic [6.7%]), 175 individuals (97.2%) completed the primary outcome assessment. Mean (SD) baseline systolic BP and diastolic BP were 130.0 (6.7) mm Hg and 79.8 (8.1) mm Hg. At 3 months, the mean systolic BP changed -5.7 mm Hg (95% CI, -7.4, to-3.9 mm Hg) in the DASH-patterned group and -2.3 mm Hg (95% CI, -4.1 to -0.4 mm Hg) in the self-directed group (difference in changes, -3.4 mm Hg; 95% CI, -5.9 to -0.8 mm Hg; P = .009). Compared with the self-directed group, after 3 months the DASH-patterned group changed mean diastolic BP by -2.4 mm Hg (95% CI, -4.2 to -0.5 mm Hg), urine sodium level by -545 mg/24 h (95% CI, -1041 to -50 mg/24 h), and LDL cholesterol by -8.0 mg/dL (95% CI, -13.7 to -2.3 mg/dL) (to convert LDL cholesterol to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259). Effects were not maintained 6 months after the intervention was initiated. No effects occurred in BMI or hemoglobin A1c level. In this study, a program of home-delivered, DASH-style groceries plus dietitian counseling decreased BP and LDL cholesterol levels beyond comparable monetary compensation. However, effects were not maintained after the intervention ended. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05121337.",

      "abstract": "Electronic cigarettes (EC) are handheld electronic vaping devices that produce an aerosol by heating a liquid. People who smoke, healthcare providers, and regulators want to know if EC can help people quit smoking, and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This review update was conducted as part of a living systematic review. To examine the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of EC for helping people who smoke tobacco achieve long-term smoking abstinence, in comparison to non-nicotine EC, other smoking cessation treatments, and no treatment. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to 1 March 2025, reference-checked, and contacted study authors. We included trials randomising people who smoked to an EC or control condition. We also included uncontrolled intervention studies where all participants received an EC intervention. Studies had to measure an eligible outcome. Critical outcomes were abstinence from smoking after at least six months, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). Important outcomes were biomarkers, toxicants/carcinogens, and longer-term EC use. We used the RoB 1 tool to assess risk of bias for each study and GRADE to assess evidence certainty. We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Where appropriate, we pooled data using random-effects models to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences with 95% CIs. We included 104 completed studies (14 new to this update), representing 30,366 participants, of which 61 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We rated 11 included studies as being at low risk of bias, 70 at high risk (including all non-randomised studies), and the remainder at unclear risk overall. Nicotine EC result in increased quit rates compared to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (high-certainty evidence) (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.88; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 2703 participants). In absolute terms, this might translate to an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 5 more). The rate of occurrence of AEs is probably similar between groups (moderate-certainty evidence (limited by imprecision)) (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.37; I² = 58%; 7 studies, 2241 participants). SAEs were rare, and there is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates differ between groups due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.03; I² = 30%; 8 studies, 2950 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nicotine EC probably result in increased quit rates compared to non-nicotine EC (moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision) (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.70; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 1918 participants). In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional two quitters per 100 (95% CI 0 to 4 more). There is probably little to no difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (moderate-certainty evidence) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.08; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 840 participants). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differ between groups, due to very serious imprecision (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.73; I² = 0%; 10 studies, 1717 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to behavioural support only or no support, quit rates may be higher for participants randomised to nicotine EC (low-certainty evidence due to risk of bias) (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.25; I² = 13%; 11 studies, 6819 participants). In absolute terms, this represents an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 5 more). There was some evidence that (non-serious) AEs may be more common in people randomised to nicotine EC (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.55; I² = 66%; 8 studies, 2485 participants; very low-certainty evidence) but the evidence is uncertain and, again, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.29; I² = 0%; 15 studies, 4716 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Data from non-randomised studies were consistent with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with continued EC use. Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons; hence, evidence for these is limited, with CIs often encompassing both clinically significant harm and benefit. There is high-certainty evidence that nicotine EC increase quit rates compared to NRT, and moderate-certainty evidence that they probably increase quit rates compared to EC without nicotine. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with behavioural support or no support also suggests benefit, but is less certain due to risk of bias inherent in the study designs. CIs were, for the most part, wide for data on AEs, SAEs, and other safety markers, with no evidence of a difference in AEs between nicotine and non-nicotine EC nor between nicotine EC and NRT, but low-certainty evidence for increased AEs compared with behavioural support/no support. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect evidence of serious harm from nicotine EC, but longer, larger trials are needed to fully evaluate safety. Included studies tested regulated nicotine-containing EC; illicit products and/or products containing other active substances (e.g. tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) may have different harm profiles. The main limitation of the evidence base remains imprecision for some comparisons and for safety outcomes due to the relatively small number of RCTs contributing, often with low event rates. Further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide up-to-date information to decision-makers, this is a living systematic review.

      "abstract": "In patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes and multivessel coronary artery disease, the question of whether to undertake a strategy of complete revascularisation in cases in which percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is performed routinely on non-culprit lesions (in addition to the culprit lesion) or whether to restrict PCI only to the culprit lesion is a common dilemma. The Complete Revascularisation Trialists' Collaboration aimed to determine, based on the totality of data from randomised trials, the effect of a complete revascularisation strategy on major cardiovascular events and whether it reduces cardiovascular death. In this individual patient data meta-analysis, trials were included if they enrolled at least 250 patients, compared a complete revascularisation strategy (with PCI) to a culprit lesion-only PCI strategy, and enrolled patients presenting with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. To ensure that no trials were overlooked, we searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for randomised controlled trials published between 1996 and Sept 15, 2025. The primary outcomes were the composite of cardiovascular death or new myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death alone. Hierarchical testing of cardiovascular death alone was planned contingent on reduction in cardiovascular death or new myocardial infarction based on the prespecified alpha level of 0·04. A one-stage individual patient data meta-analysis was performed using a Cox frailty model. All-cause death was the secondary outcome; non-cardiovascular death and new myocardial infarction were additional outcomes. All analyses included all randomly assigned patients. The meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO, CRD420251124098. Six randomised controlled trials involving 8836 individuals were included. The median age was 65·8 years (IQR 57·0-76·0), and 2088 (23·6%) patients were female and 6748 (76·4%) were male. Overall, 7768 (87·9%) patients presented with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and 1068 (12·1%) with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. At a median follow-up of 36·0 months (IQR 30·6-48·0), cardiovascular death or new myocardial infarction occurred in 382 (9·0%) of 4259 patients in the complete revascularisation group compared with 528 (11·5%) of 4577 patients in the culprit lesion-only group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·76 [95% CI 0·67-0·87], p<0·0001). There were 155 (3·6%) cardiovascular deaths in the complete revascularisation group compared with 209 (4·6%) in the culprit lesion-only group (HR 0·76 [95% CI 0·62-0·93], p=0·0091). All-cause death occurred in 308 (7·2%) patients in the complete revascularisation group compared with 370 (8·1%) patients in the culprit lesion-only group (HR 0·85 [95% CI 0·73-0·99], p=0·039). Non-cardiovascular death was similar between the groups (153 [3·6%] in the complete revascularisation group vs 161 [3·5%] in the culprit lesion-only group; HR 0·98 [95% CI 0·78-1·22], p=0·85). Complete revascularisation reduced new myocardial infarctions compared with culprit lesion-only PCI (255 [6·0%] vs 357 [7·8%]; HR 0·76 [95% CI 0·65-0·90], p=0·0011). In patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction and multivessel disease, complete revascularisation reduced the composite of cardiovascular death or new myocardial infarction as well as cardiovascular death alone compared with a culprit lesion-only PCI strategy. In addition, all-cause death was lower with complete revascularisation. These data provide the strongest and most robust evidence to date that complete revascularisation improves important cardiovascular clinical outcomes. None.",

At a median follow-up of 36·0 months (IQR 30·6-48·0), cardiovascular death or new myocardial infarction occurred in 382 (9·0%) of 4259 patients in the complete revascularisation group compared with 528 (11·5%) of 4577 patients in the culprit lesion-only group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·76 [95% CI 0·67-0·87], p<0·0001). There were 155 (3·6%) cardiovascular deaths in the complete revascularisation group compared with 209 (4·6%) in the culprit lesion-only group (HR 0·76 [95% CI 0·62-0·93], p=0·0091). All-cause death occurred in 308 (7·2%) patients in the complete revascularisation group compared with 370 (8·1%) patients in the culprit lesion-only group (HR 0·85 [95% CI 0·73-0·99], p=0·039). Non-cardiovascular death was similar between the groups (153 [3·6%] in the complete revascularisation group vs 161 [3·5%] in the culprit lesion-only group; HR 0·98 [95% CI 0·78-1·22], p=0·85). Complete revascularisation reduced new myocardial infarctions compared with culprit lesion-only PCI (255 [6·0%] vs 357 [7·8%]; HR 0·76 [95% CI 0·65-0·90], p=0·0011)."

Participants in the intervention group reported high CGM satisfaction and endorsed the behavioural and psychosocial benefits. For women with early GDM, despite no improvement in TIR, CGM improved maternal and neonatal outcomes versus SMBG.

Randomised clinical trial (RAFF4 trial). 12 tertiary care emergency departments in Canada. Patients with acute atrial fibrillation for whom acute rhythm control was a safe option. Patients were randomised (1:1) to an intravenous infusion of vernakalant or procainamide; when rapid conversion did not occur, patients were offered electrical cardioversion. The primary outcome was conversion to sinus rhythm within 30 minutes of drug infusion completion. Secondary outcomes included time to conversion to sinus rhythm and whether the patient required electrical cardioversion. Of the 350 enrolled eligible patients, baseline characteristics were similar in the procainamide (n=172) and vernakalant (n=178) groups. For the primary outcome of conversion success, vernakalant was more effective (62.4%  48.3%; adjusted absolute difference 15.0%, 95% confidence interval 4.6% to 25.0%, P=0.005; adjusted odds ratio 1.87, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.9, P=0.006). With vernakalant, time to conversion was faster (21.8  44.7 minutes; mean difference -22.9, 95% confidence interval -29.9 to -16.0, P<0.001), and fewer patients underwent attempted electrical cardioversion (33.7%  44.2%; odds ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.96, P=0.033).

In this head-to-head comparison, vernakalant was superior to procainamide for patients with higher conversion rates and faster times to conversion.

In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 26 sites in Canada and Australia, we assigned adult patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis to daily supplementation with fish oil (4 g of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [1.6 g of EPA and 0.8 g of DHA]) or corn-oil placebo.

      "abstract": "Current guidelines recommend a stepwise strategy to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Earlier intensive strategies based on a combination of lipid-lowering therapies (LLTs) could be useful from the onset of ACS. However, the role of bempedoic acid in ACS, particularly when combined with high-intensity statins and ezetimibe, remains uncertain. The aim of ES-BempeDACS (Efficacy and Security of Bempedoic Acid in Acute Coronary Syndrome) was to compare the efficacy and safety of triple LLT (high-dose, high-intensity statin+ezetimibe+bempedoic acid) versus standard of care (high-dose, high-intensity statin+ezetimibe) after ACS. ES-BempeDACS is a multicenter, independent, pragmatic, prospective, randomized, open, blinded end point controlled trial conducted in 12 Spanish hospitals between November 2023 and October 2024. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving LDL-C <55 mg/dL (<1.4 mmol/L) at 8 weeks after ACS, comparing triple LLT with standard of care. A total of 206 patients (59.5±10.9 years of age [mean±SD]; 21.4% women) were randomized within the first 72 hours of ACS to triple LLT or standard therapy of high-intensity statin+ezetimibe (ie, dual LLT). The baseline LDL-C level was 133.6±28.8 mg/dL. After 8 weeks, the LDL-C level was reduced to <55 mg/dL in 59.4% of patients in the triple LLT group compared with 53.1% in the control group (dual LLT; =0.376). The percentage change in LDL-C level was 57.5±17.8% and 56.9±18.5% in the triple and dual LLT groups, respectively (=0.823). Triple versus dual LLT showed similar results in reduction of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (49.0±25.4 in triple LLT versus 49.1±31.2 in dual LLT; =0.970) and triglyceride levels (14.9±36.9 in triple LLT versus 16.8±36.0 in dual LLT;) =0.718), without differences in adverse events. Both dual and triple LLT after ACS allow for high rates (>50%) of adequate LDL-C control (<55 mg/dL) at 8 weeks. Adding bempedoic acid to statin-ezetimibe therapy in the setting of ACS is safe but failed to improve the percentage of patients achieving the LDL-C goal (<55 mg/dL) at 8 weeks. Larger, randomized studies are needed to confirm our findings. URL: https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu; Unique identifier: 2021-006550-31.",

          "text": "Current guidelines recommend a stepwise strategy to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Earlier intensive strategies based on a combination of lipid-lowering therapies (LLTs) could be useful from the onset of ACS. However, the role of bempedoic acid in ACS, particularly when combined with high-intensity statins and ezetimibe, remains uncertain. The aim of ES-BempeDACS (Efficacy and Security of Bempedoic Acid in Acute Coronary Syndrome) was to compare the efficacy and safety of triple LLT (high-dose, high-intensity statin+ezetimibe+bempedoic acid) versus standard of care (high-dose, high-intensity statin+ezetimibe) after ACS."

      "abstract": "In 2023, an estimated 1.3 million children (aged 0-14 years) became ill with tuberculosis, and 166,000 children (aged 0-15 years) died from the disease. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) is a molecular World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended rapid diagnostic test that detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and rifampicin resistance. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2020 and last updated in 2022. Parts of the current update informed the 2024 WHO updated guidance for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert Ultra for detecting pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance in children (aged 0-9 years) with presumed tuberculosis. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, and three trial registers without language restrictions to 6 October 2023. For study design, we included cross-sectional and cohort studies and randomized trials that evaluated Xpert Ultra in HIV-positive and HIV-negative children aged birth to nine years. Regarding specimen type, we included studies evaluating sputum, gastric, stool, or nasopharyngeal specimens (pulmonary tuberculosis); cerebrospinal fluid (tuberculous meningitis); and fine needle aspirate or surgical biopsy tissue (lymph node tuberculosis). Reference standards for detection of tuberculosis were microbiological reference standard (MRS; including culture) or composite reference standard (CRS); for stool, we considered Xpert Ultra in sputum or gastric aspirates in addition to culture. Reference standards for detection of rifampicin resistance in sputum were phenotypic drug susceptibility testing or targeted or whole genome sequencing. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the tailored QUADAS-2 tool, judging risk of bias separately for each target condition and sample type. We conducted separate meta-analyses for detection of pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance. We used a bivariate model to estimate summary sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. This update included 23 studies (including 9 new studies since the previous review) that evaluated detection of pulmonary tuberculosis (21 studies, 9223 children), tuberculous meningitis (3 studies, 215 children), lymph node tuberculosis (2 studies, 58 children), and rifampicin resistance (3 studies, 130 children). Seventeen studies (74%) took place in countries with a high tuberculosis burden. Overall, risk of bias and applicability concerns were low. Detection of pulmonary tuberculosis (microbiological reference standard) Sputum (11 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity was 75.3% (95% CI 68.9% to 80.8%; 345 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and specificity was 95.9% (95% CI 92.3% to 97.9%; 2645 children; high-certainty evidence). Gastric aspirate (12 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity was 69.6% (95% CI 60.3% to 77.6%; 167 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and specificity was 91.0% (95% CI 82.5% to 95.6%; 1792 children; moderate-certainty evidence). Stool (10 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity was 68.0% (95% CI 50.3% to 81.7%; 255 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and specificity was 98.2% (95% CI 96.3% to 99.1%; 2630 children; high-certainty evidence). Nasopharyngeal aspirate (6 studies) Xpert Ultra summary sensitivity was 46.2% (95% CI 34.9% to 57.9%; 94 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and specificity was 97.5% (95% CI 95.1% to 98.7%; 1259 children; high-certainty evidence). Xpert Ultra sensitivity was lower against CRS than against MRS for all specimen types, while the specificities were similar. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis Meta-analysis was not possible for lymph node tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis due to low study numbers. Interpretation of results For a population of 1000 children, where 100 have pulmonary tuberculosis: In sputum: • 112 would be Xpert Ultra positive, of whom 75 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (true positives) and 37 would not (false positives). • 888 would be Xpert Ultra negative, of whom 863 would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (true negatives) and 25 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (false negatives). In gastric aspirate: • 151 would be Xpert Ultra positive, of whom 70 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (true positives) and 81 would not (false positives). • 849 would be Xpert Ultra negative, of whom 819 would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (true negatives) and 30 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (false negatives). In stool: • 85 would be Xpert Ultra positive, of whom 68 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (true positives) and 17 would not (false positives). • 915 would be Xpert Ultra negative, of whom 883 would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (true negatives) and 32 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (false negatives). In nasopharyngeal aspirate: • 68 would be Xpert Ultra positive, of whom 46 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (true positives) and 22 would not (false positives). • 932 would be Xpert Ultra negative, of whom 878 would not have pulmonary tuberculosis (true negatives), and 54 would have pulmonary tuberculosis (false negatives). Detection of rifampicin resistance Three studies with 76 children evaluated detection of rifampicin resistance (sputum only); two of these studies reported no cases and one reported rifampicin resistance in two children. Xpert Ultra sensitivity was moderate in sputum, gastric aspirate, and stool specimens. Nasopharyngeal aspirate had the lowest sensitivity. Xpert Ultra specificity was high against both MRS and CRS. We were unable to determine the accuracy of Xpert Ultra for detecting tuberculous meningitis, lymph node tuberculosis, and rifampicin resistance due to a paucity of data. This update was funded through WHO. The protocol for this review was originally published through Cochrane in 2019.

To test evidence-based rehabilitation strategies for improving cognitive symptoms in persons with long COVID. This was a 5-arm, multicenter, randomized clinical trial of 3 remotely delivered interventions conducted between August 17, 2023, and June 10, 2024. The study took place at 22 trial sites and included the screening of individuals with cognitive long COVID. Participants were randomized to 1 of 5 arms: adaptive computerized cognitive training (BrainHQ [Posit Science]), cognitive-behavioral rehabilitation involving both group and individual counseling sessions (PASC-Cognitive Recovery [PASC-CoRE]) paired with BrainHQ, and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with BrainHQ. Two comparator arms were included as follows: unstructured computer puzzles and games (active comparator) and sham tDCS paired with BrainHQ. The interventions occurred 5 times per week over 10 weeks. Cognitive and behavioral in-person assessments were performed at baseline, midintervention, at the end of intervention, and 3 months after the end of the intervention. The primary outcome measure was the modified Everyday Cognition Scale 2 (ECog2) completed at the end of the intervention compared to the baseline visit based on participant self-report looking back over the prior 7 days. A total of 378 individuals were screened, from which there were 328 participants (median [IQR] age, 48.0 [37.0-58.0] years; 241 female [73.5%]; race: 15 Asian [4.6%], 47 Black [14.3%], and 235 White [71.6%]; ethnicity: 52 Hispanic [15.9%]). None of the 3 active interventions demonstrated benefits on the modified ECog2 in the intention-to-treat population by the end of the intervention period. The adjusted differences in mean change were 0.0 (95% CI, -0.2 to 0.2) for BrainHQ vs active comparator, 0.1 (95% CI, -0.1 to 0.3) for PASC-CoRE + BrainHQ vs active comparator, 0.0 (95% CI, -0.2 to 0.2) for tDCS-active + BrainHQ vs tDCS-sham + BrainHQ, and 0.1 (95% CI, -0.1 to 0.3) for PASC-CoRE + BrainHQ vs BrainHQ alone. Secondary participant-reported outcomes and neuropsychological tests showed no differential benefits for any treatment arm. All 5 arms demonstrated some improvements over time on the modified ECog2 and on secondary outcomes. There were no serious adverse events attributable to the interventions. This phase 2 randomized clinical trial failed to demonstrate differential benefits for online cognitive training, a structured cognitive rehabilitation program, and tDCS for cognitive long COVID.
