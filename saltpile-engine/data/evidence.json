      "abstract": "Ibuprofen is first-line therapy for musculoskeletal pain. However, two-thirds of children experience inadequate pain relief with ibuprofen monotherapy, and the efficacy of additive medications for moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain is unclear. To determine whether treatment with an opioid (hydromorphone) plus ibuprofen or nonopioid (acetaminophen [paracetamol]) plus ibuprofen decreased pain scores compared with ibuprofen alone. Two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trials were conducted from April 2019 to March 2023 in 6 university-affiliated, tertiary care Canadian pediatric emergency departments. Children aged 6 to 17 years presenting with a nonoperative acute limb injury (<24 hours) and a verbal numerical rating scale (vNRS) pain score of 5 or more out of 10 were enrolled. Date of final follow-up was March 22, 2023. The opioid trial randomized participants to a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus hydromorphone, ibuprofen plus acetaminophen, or ibuprofen alone. The nonopioid trial randomized participants to a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus acetaminophen or ibuprofen alone. In all groups, ibuprofen was dosed at 10 mg/kg (maximum, 600 mg). The acetaminophen dose was 15 mg/kg (maximum, 1000 mg), and the hydromorphone dose was 0.05 mg/kg (maximum, 5 mg). The primary efficacy outcome was self-reported vNRS pain score at 60 minutes post medication administration (score range, 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst pain]; minimal clinically important difference, 1.5). The primary safety end point was the proportion of children with any adverse event related to study drug administration. A total of 8098 children were screened for eligibility; 699 were randomized and 653 were included in the efficacy analyses. The opioid trial included 249 children: 110 randomized to ibuprofen plus hydromorphone, 70 to ibuprofen plus acetaminophen, and 69 to ibuprofen alone. The nonopioid trial included 450 children: 225 randomized to a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus acetaminophen and 225 randomized to ibuprofen alone. The mean (SD) age of children in the 2 trials was 11.5 (3.5) years and 47.4% were female. The mean (SD) vNRS score at recruitment was 6.4 (1.8). In pooled analyses, mean (SD) vNRS scores 60 minutes after drug administration were 4.8 (2.6) in the ibuprofen plus hydromorphone group, 4.6 (2.4) in the ibuprofen plus acetaminophen group, and 4.6 (2.3) in the ibuprofen alone group (P = .78). Any adverse event occurred at higher rates in the ibuprofen plus hydromorphone group (28.2%) compared with the ibuprofen plus acetaminophen (6.1%) or ibuprofen alone groups (5.8%). No serious adverse events occurred. For children with acute nonoperative musculoskeletal injury, pain scores at 60 minutes after drug administration did not improve with ibuprofen plus acetaminophen or ibuprofen plus hydromorphone compared with ibuprofen alone. Adverse events were 4-fold more frequent with hydromorphone. Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT03767933.",

Dyslipidemia is a major contributor to the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. The safety and effectiveness of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibition to lower cholesterol and to prevent cardiac allograft vasculopathy early after HT are not well established. In this investigator-initiated, prospective, multicenter, double-blind randomized trial, participants were randomized early after HT to receive either alirocumab or placebo in addition to rosuvastatin. Before randomization and at 1 year, all participants underwent invasive coronary assessment, including angiography, fractional flow reserve, coronary flow reserve, the index of microcirculatory resistance, and intravascular ultrasound with near-infrared spectroscopy. Lipid values were assessed at baseline and at prespecified intervals. The primary end point was the change in coronary artery plaque volume from baseline to 1 year after HT based on serial intravascular ultrasound. A total of 114 HT recipients were included (57 assigned to alirocumab and 57 assigned to placebo). Baseline characteristics were well matched between the 2 groups. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased significantly from baseline to 1 year in the alirocumab arm (72.7±31.7 to 31.5±20.7 mg/dL; <0.001) and did not change with placebo (69.0±22.4 to 69.2±28.1 mg/dL; =0.92). Plaque volume increased numerically in both groups from baseline to 12 months (alirocumab, 176.3±95.2 to 184.5±105.4 mm³; =0.23; placebo 173.7±96.7 to 183.1±109.8 mm; =0.15).

Fractional flow reserve, coronary flow reserve, and the index of microcirculatory resistance did not change significantly with the addition of alirocumab. There were no significant adverse events related to alirocumab. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibition with alirocumab in addition to statin therapy early after HT safely lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but did not reduce coronary artery plaque progression after 1 year compared with rosuvastatin alone in patients with a low baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, as the initial diagnostic test for tuberculosis (TB). However, the effect of these tests on key health outcomes is not well-established. To assess the effects of three classes of rapid NAATs-low-complexity automated (LC-aNAATs), low-complexity manual (LC-mNAATs) and moderate-complexity automated (MC-aNAATs)-compared with smear microscopy or bacterial culture on patient outcomes in people investigated for TB, irrespective of age or disease severity. Our secondary objective was to assess the effects of the three classes of rapid NAATs in vulnerable populations such as children and people living with HIV, to inform health equity considerations. We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other electronic bibliographic databases, and two trial registries, from 1900 up to 21 January 2025. We also checked reference lists of included articles and relevant systematic reviews to identify additional studies. We contacted manufacturers, researchers, and experts working on new diagnostic tests for TB through a WHO public call for data, which lasted from 30 November 2023 to 15 February 2024. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that involved children and adults of any age who were suspected to have TB (i.e. 'presumptive TB'). We included both individually randomised and cluster-randomised designs. In terms of the intervention, we considered \"design-locked, marketed test technologies\" (i.e. testing technologies with designs that have been finalised and are currently being sold or promoted in the healthcare market) by class and tests provided by the WHO: LC-aNAATs (e.g. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, Truenat MTB Plus, Truenat MTB-RIF Dx); LC-mNAATs (e.g. TB-LAMP); and MC-aNAATs (e.g. FluoroType XDR-TB). We restricted comparative strategies to smear microscopy and bacterial culture methods. We excluded studies on standard Xpert MTB/RIF, which has been superseded by the Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra test. Our critical outcomes were all-cause mortality from the time of the first diagnostic test to the end of the trial follow-up, and cure rates among people with bacteriologically-confirmed TB at the beginning of treatment and who completed treatment with no evidence of failure. Our important outcomes were the proportion of participants lost to follow-up, time to TB diagnosis, and time to treatment initiation. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for all reported outcomes in the included studies using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2). Disagreements were resolved through discussion or by consulting a senior review author as needed. We could not combine the results statistically because the included studies measured, defined, or reported outcomes differently. As a result, we presented the findings from each study in tables, forest plots, and using narrative descriptions. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome using GRADEpro GDT software. Of the 2231 records identified by our search, we included two trials (reported in three articles) in the review. The trials compared an LC-aNAAT (Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra) with smear microscopy and involved 11,228 adults aged 18 years and above. One was an individually randomised trial and one was cluster-randomised. Both trials were conducted in Africa (one in South Africa and the other in Uganda). One trial assessed all-cause mortality at six and 18 months, loss-to-follow-up, and the time taken to diagnose TB, while the other assessed the time taken to initiate treatment. Whether Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra or smear microscopy was used to detect TB made little to no difference to all-cause mortality at six months (risk ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.01; 1 RCT, 8116 participants; high-certainty evidence) and 18 months (adjusted rate ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.29; 1 RCT, 8413 participants; high-certainty evidence). Neither study assessed how the test used affects the likelihood of curing TB. One trial (XPEL-TB 2021) reported a slightly higher risk of loss to follow-up with Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (13.6%) than with smear microscopy (10.1%), with a risk ratio of 1.35 (95% CI 1.20 to 1.51; 1 RCT, 9563 participants; high-certainty evidence). A testing strategy that includes Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra probably results in a reduction in time to diagnosis (adjusted geometric mean ratio 0.49, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.62; 1 RCT, 10,644 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and a similar reduction in time to treatment (adjusted geometric mean ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.58; 1 RCT, 10,644 participants; hazard ratio 3.00, 95% CI 1.18 to 7.60; 1 RCT, 584 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence in this review is limited by sparse data, a lack of some key outcomes (specifically, cure), the use of varied effect measures, and the exclusion of paediatric populations. While we graded the evidence as moderate certainty for time to diagnosis and treatment initiation, serious concerns about the risk of bias and the narrow scope restrict the applicability and generalisability of the evidence to other NAATs and patient outcomes. Based on limited evidence from two trials that compared Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra to smear microscopy, the use of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra to test for TB makes little to no difference to all-cause mortality at six and 18 months. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra probably decreases the time taken to diagnose TB and time to treatment initiation. The use of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra increases the risk of loss to follow-up compared with smear microscopy. There were no data on the effects of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra compared with smear microscopy or culture on tuberculosis cure rates. This Cochrane review was funded by the World Health Organization (WHO).

      "abstract": "The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of GLP-1RAs on functional walking distance and the risk of major adverse limb events (MALE) or lower extremity amputation (LEA) in people with type 2 diabetes and peripheral artery disease (PAD). We searched many electronic databases up to 10 October 2025 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies. We included studies enrolling adults with type 2 diabetes and PAD, comparing GLP-1RAs against placebo or other glucose-lowering drugs. The primary outcomes were walking distance, MALE, or LEA. Data were pooled using a random-effects model, with hazard ratios (HR) or risk ratios (RR). Risk of bias was assessed using RoB2 for RCTs and ROBINS-I for cohort studies; evidence certainty was evaluated using the GRADE approach. We included seven studies (3 RCTs, 4 cohorts) enrolling 107 092 participants. The meta-analysis of two RCTs with 847 participants demonstrated a significant improvement in walking distance with liraglutide or semaglutide (HR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.15, p < 0.001), with no heterogeneity (I = 0.0%) and moderate certainty of evidence. In the additional meta-analysis of two RCTs with 3592 participants, the incidence of MALE or LEA did not differ significantly between patients receiving exenatide or semaglutide and those receiving placebo. The meta-analysis of four cohort studies with 104 292 participants showed that GLP-1RAs reduced the risk of LEA (RR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.39-0.73, p < 0.001), with high heterogeneity (I = 85.96%), totally related to one study, and very low certainty of evidence. Subgroup analyses showed a significant difference (p < 0.001) between GLP-1RA therapies, with the strongest associations with LEA reduction for tirzepatide and semaglutide (55% and 54% risk reduction, respectively); there was no difference in the LEA outcome excluding from the analysis patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers at baseline. This meta-analysis suggests that GLP-1RAs are associated with a significant improvement in functional walking distance and a reduction in the risk of LEA in people with type 2 and PAD. Further dedicated RCTs are needed to confirm these limb-specific benefits of GLP-1RAs.",

      "abstract": "Influenza infection poses a substantial risk of severe complications, particularly in older adults and high-risk populations, such as individuals with diabetes. The high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV) has demonstrated superior efficacy against influenza infection compared with the standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV) among adults 65 years or older. However, there is limited evidence on its effectiveness in preventing severe respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with diabetes. To investigate the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of HD-IIV vs SD-IIV against severe respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes according to diabetes status and across diabetes subgroups. This was a prespecified secondary analysis of DANFLU-2, a pragmatic, open-label, individually randomized clinical trial conducted in Denmark during the 2022/2023 to 2024/2025 influenza seasons. Adults 65 years or older were eligible for inclusion regardless of comorbidities. Data were obtained from nationwide health registries and analyzed from June to October 2025. Participants were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive HD-IIV or SD-IIV. Outcomes included respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations. The potential effect modification by diabetes status and across diabetes subgroups was tested. Among 332 438 participants (mean [SD] age, 73.7 [5.8] years; 161 538 female individuals [48.6%]), 43 881 (13.2%) had diabetes. Overall, HD-IIV compared with SD-IIV was associated with reduced cardiorespiratory hospitalization, cardiovascular hospitalization, and influenza hospitalization.

This review aimed to evaluate the effect of self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Scopus from January 2014 to May 2025 for systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials enrolling adults with type 2 diabetes that evaluated SMBG or CGM versus no monitoring or SMBG, respectively. Fifteen systematic reviews comprising 81 unique studies and 23 657 participants were included. Reviews comparing SMBG with no monitoring demonstrated a modest but significant reduction in HbA1c (MD -0.23%, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.18; I = 21%). Reviews directly comparing CGM with SMBG showed greater HbA1c reduction with CGM (MD -0.29%, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.24; I = 0%). Subgroup analyses for SMBG indicated consistent benefits across follow-up duration, monitoring structure, and study quality, although heterogeneity was high in some comparisons. Subgroup analyses for CGM types found both isCGM/FGM (MD -0.27%, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.11) and rtCGM (MD -0.36%, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.27) superior to SMBG. These findings support glucose monitoring for optimizing glycaemic management and outcomes. Further investment in cost-effectiveness studies is warranted to assess broader implementation in this population.",

Index cases; adults and children weighing >15 kg with scabies, confirmed by dermoscopy. Index cases were randomly assigned to the ivermectin group or permethrin group (1:1 ratio). Each member of the cluster, defined as the household of each index case, received the same treatment as the index case, except for children weighing <15 kg who were prescribed topical 5% permethrin. All participants received oral ivermectin 200 µg/kg or 5% permethrin cream on day 0 and day 10. Permethrin cream was applied to the whole body, from head to toe. The primary outcome was clinical cure of the cluster on day 28 (ie, disappearance of clinical signs and symptoms of scabies for all cluster members). Secondary outcomes were index case and individual level analyses and safety. Dermatologists were used as assessors and were masked to the treatment. 507 participants in 142 households (clusters) were treated with ivermectin and 568 participants in 147 households received permethrin. Cluster level cure rates were 71.8% versus 88.5% (-16.7 percentage point difference, 95% confidence interval (CI) -26.3 to -7.1) for ivermectin versus permethrin. Secondary outcome percentage point differences also showed the inferiority of ivermectin compared with 5% permethrin for index cases (76.6%  91.5%; percentage point difference -14.9, 95% CI -23.6 to -6.2) and participants (85.3%  94.2%; -9.2 percentage point difference, -14.9 to -3.5).

STORM-PE (A Prospective, Multicenter, Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating Anticoagulation Alone Versus Anticoagulation Plus Mechanical Aspiration With the Indigo Aspiration System for the Treatment of Intermediate-High Risk Acute Pulmonary Embolism) is the first reported randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy and to evaluate the safety of mechanical thrombectomy, specifically computer-assisted vacuum thrombectomy (CAVT) with anticoagulation compared to anticoagulation alone. STORM-PE is an international randomized controlled trial with 1:1 randomization to CAVT with anticoagulation or anticoagulation alone. Eligible adults had acute-onset (symptoms ≤14 days), intermediate-high risk PE and were normotensive, with an RV/LV ratio ≥1.0 on computed tomographic pulmonary angiography and elevated cardiac biomarkers. The primary end-point analysis tested for a difference between groups for the change in RV/LV ratio at 48 hours, assessed by a blinded independent imaging core laboratory. Secondary end points included major adverse events within 7 days (a composite of clinical deterioration necessitating rescue therapy, PE-related mortality, symptomatic recurrent PE, and major bleeding), adjudicated by an external clinical events committee. Additional outcomes included change in vital signs and core laboratory-assessed pulmonary artery obstruction at 48 hours. A total of 100 patients enrolled across 22 sites were randomized to CAVT (n=47) or anticoagulation alone (n=53). Baseline characteristics were comparable between arms.

Refined modified and modified Miller scores exhibited greater changes for CAVT than anticoagulation alone at 48 hours (<0.001). Early normalization of vital signs within 48 hours was more frequent after CAVT. The major adverse event rate within 7 days was not different between groups (CAVT, 4.3% versus anticoagulation, 7.5%; =0.681). Two PE-related deaths occurred in the CAVT arm.

Multicenter, multinational prospective management outcome study conducted in 27 centers in Belgium, Canada, France, and Switzerland between January 2015 and October 2022 (last follow-up visit, January 30, 2023) and including outpatients presenting to the emergency department with suspected DVT. Patients were assessed by a sequential diagnostic strategy based on the assessment of clinical pretest probability by the Wells score, a highly sensitive D-dimer test, and leg compression ultrasonography. Patients in whom DVT was ruled out were followed up for a 3-month period. The primary outcome was the rate of adjudicated symptomatic venous thromboembolic events during follow-up in patients in whom DVT was ruled out based on a D-dimer value between the conventional cutoff of 500 µg/L and their age-adjusted cutoff. A total of 3205 patients were included. Median age was 59 years, and 1737 (54%) were female. DVT prevalence was 14%. Among the 2169 patients with a non-high or unlikely clinical probability, 531 (24.5% [95% CI, 22.7%-26.4%]) had a D-dimer level less than 500 µg/L, and 161 additional patients (7.4% [95% CI, 6.4%-8.6%]) had a D-dimer level between 500 µg/L and their age-adjusted cutoff.

This meta-analysis included randomised trials on the effects of lifestyle interventions (physical activity based, diet based, or mixed) in pregnancy on gestational diabetes. Main outcomes were gestational diabetes defined by any criteria and by UK NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) criteria; other outcomes included IADPSG (International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group) and modified IADPSG defined gestational diabetes. A two stage IPD meta-analysis estimated summary odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals and interactions (subgroup effects), along with absolute risk reduction estimates. Aggregate data from non-IPD trials were added to the meta-analysis when possible. Intervention effects were ranked using network meta-analysis. 104 randomised trials (35 993 women) were included, with IPD for 68% of participants (24 391 women; 54 studies). Lifestyle interventions reduced gestational diabetes defined by any criteria by 10% in IPD trials (odds ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.02; absolute risk reduction 1.3%, 95% CI -0.3% to 2.6%), and by 20% when combining IPD and non-IPD trials (odds ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.88; absolute risk reduction 2.6%, 95% CI 1.6% to 3.6%), and no reduction was observed using NICE criteria (odds ratio 0.98, 95% CI 0.84to 1.13).

Given the primary treatment goal to improve patients' health status, defining the incremental benefits of aficamten over metoprolol on patients' symptoms, function, and quality of life is needed. In this study, the authors sought to compare patient-reported health status benefits of aficamten with metoprolol. Adults with symptomatic oHCM (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ] Clinical Summary Score [CSS] ≤90; left ventricular outflow tract obstruction ≥30 mm Hg at rest or ≥50 mm Hg with Valsalva) were randomly assigned to 24 weeks of aficamten or metoprolol as monotherapy. Changes in KCCQ Overall Summary Score (OSS) and Seattle Angina Questionnaire Summary Score (SAQ-SS), collected serially throughout the trial, were compared between treatment groups at 24 weeks using linear regression, adjusted for randomization strata and baseline scores. Individual participant experiences were described by comparing categories of clinically meaningful within-participant change: ≤-5 (worse), >-5 to <+5 (no change), +5 to <+10 (small improvement), +10 to <+15 (moderate improvement), +15 to <+20 (large improvement), and ≥+20 points (very large improvement). Among 175 randomized patients, baseline health status scores were similar between treatment groups (n = 88 aficamten; n = 87 metoprolol).

This study aims to examine the impact of digital psychological interventions on the caregiver burden of dementia caregivers and investigates potential effect-modifying factors and assesses their effects on depression, self-efficacy and quality of life. This study systematically searched six databases for randomized controlled trials or non-randomized studies of interventions and included studies from database inception to 18 May 2025. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4, and subgroup analysis explored the effects of different intervention duration, formats and technological platforms. A total of 16 studies involving 750 family caregivers were included. Meta-analysis showed digital psychological interventions significantly reduced caregiver burden [Standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.21, 95% CI: -0.35 to -0.07; P = .003] and improved self-efficacy (SMD = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.61, P = .001) and quality of life (SMD = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.91, P < .001). But digital psychological interventions have no statistically significant in alleviating depressive symptoms (P = .06). Subgroup analyses revealed that interventions lasting ≤2 months, whether delivered in group or individual formats and implemented via web-based or mobile application platforms, had statistically significant effects on caregiver burden. Digital psychological interventions effectively alleviate caregiver burden and enhance their self-efficacy and quality of life. Future studies should prioritize short-term interventions and develop integrated approaches combining individual and group formats.",

We aimed to examine the clinical efficacy and safety of maintenance inhaled corticosteroids plus budesonide-formoterol reliever or terbutaline reliever in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma. This open-label, parallel-group, randomised, controlled, phase 4 trial was conducted at Wellington Hospital and two community-based primary care facilities in New Zealand. Eligible participants were aged 16-75 years, had a self-reported doctor's diagnosis of asthma, were using reliever only therapy or maintenance inhaled corticosteroids with short-acting β2-agonist reliever therapy, and were registered with a general practitioner. Participants had to have reported mean reliever use on two or more occasions per week in the 12 weeks before enrolment and had evidence of airway inflammation (FeNO ≥25 parts per billion [ppb]) at screening. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to budesonide-formoterol (budesonide 200 μg and formoterol 6 μg) reliever or terbutaline 250 μg reliever therapy using a computer-generated sequence in block sizes of four and six, stratified by region, baseline inhaled corticosteroids maintenance dose, and history of severe asthma exacerbation in the previous 12 months. All participants received maintenance budesonide 200 μg. During a 26-week treatment period, participants attended visits at weeks 0 (screening and randomisation), 13, and 26.

Participants had a mean age of 33·91 years (SD 15·54). 119 (66%) of 181 participants were female and 62 (34%) were male. Geometric mean FeNO was 62·18 ppb (SD 1·86) at baseline and 39·65 ppb (2·12) at week 26, for the budesonide-formoterol group and 68·03 ppb (1·97) at baseline and 52·98 ppb (2·27) at week 26 for the terbutaline group. Budesonide-formoterol reliever therapy resulted in a mean reduction in geometric mean FeNO of 18·50% (95% CI 2·72-31·73; p=0·024) at week 26 compared with terbutaline reliever therapy. 77 (83%) of 93 participants in the budesonide-formoterol group versus 69 (78%) of 88 in the terbutaline group had at least one adverse event (relative risk 1·06 [95% CI 0·91-1·22]; p=0·46). There were no deaths in the study. Budesonide-formoterol reliever therapy resulted in a reduction in FeNO compared with terbutaline reliever in adults with asthma using maintenance inhaled corticosteroids.

      "abstract": "Emergency Medical Services (EMS) patients with chest pain are often suspected of having non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). Current risk stratification protocols for NSTE-ACS have limitations, leading to a lack of a well-organised prehospital diagnostic pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated that using clinical risk scores (CRS) including point-of-care (POC)-troponin in the EMS can improve prehospital diagnostic pathways for suspected NSTE-ACS. The primary aim of this systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis was to assess safety of low-risk stratification for suspected NSTE-ACS patients in the prehospital setting. Prospective studies using CRS or POC-troponin for risk stratification in suspected NSTE-ACS patients within the EMS setting were included. Safety was assessed using sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) for patients identified as low risk, based on CRS or POC-troponin measurement, for three different endpoints within 30 days: (1) all-cause mortality, (2) composite of mortality and/or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), (3) major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Of 1526 articles screened, 6 were included, comprising 5.239 patients, and all utilised CRS derived from the History, ECG, Age, Risk-factor and Troponin (HEART) score. The summary of low-risk CRS diagnostic performance predicted all-cause mortality with a sensitivity of 93.2% (83.5-98.1) and NPV of 99.8% (99.5-99.9); mortality and/or AMI with a sensitivity of 91.8% (83.0-96.2) and an NPV of 97.3% (89.9-99.3); and MACE with a sensitivity of 92.8% (88.7-95.5) and an NPV of 97.2% (92.1-99.0). Lowering the CRS cut-off value for identifying low-risk patients increased sensitivity and NPV but decreased the proportion of patients classified as low risk. In well-trained EMS systems, where prompt and accurate follow-up of low-risk patients is possible, HEART-derived CRS effectively identify patients with a very low risk of 30-day mortality and MACE. However, implementation in other healthcare systems requires additional validation, given the variations in healthcare structure, risk stratification processes and follow-up capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Reducing blood loss at the time of scheduled cesarean improves maternal outcomes. Type of suture material and closure technique may contribute to reduction in blood loss specifically related to the incision site as well as more expeditiously achieve uterine contractility. Prior publications have noted reduced closure times when using knotless barbed suture, but available evidence remains limited. To examine whether patients whose hysterotomies were closed with Stratafix barbed suture at the time of scheduled cesarean delivery had lower quantified blood loss compared to patients who received Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture. This was a prospective randomized clinical trial at a single tertiary care center in New York City. Patients with a scheduled primary or repeat cesarean delivery ≥37.0 weeks' gestation provided informed consent and were randomized to either Stratafix barbed suture or Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture for hysterotomy closure. The primary outcome was quantified blood loss, measured in milliliters using the mobile Stryker Triton artificial intelligence scanner. Secondary outcomes included (1) single-layer hysterotomy closure time, (2) use of additional hemostatic sutures, (3) intraoperative use of hemostatic agents, (4) rate of surgical site infection (including endometritis), and (5) differences in average postoperative pain. The Mann-Whitney U test compared observed medians of continuous outcomes between groups. Chi-squared tests compared proportional differences in categorical outcomes between groups. An a posteriori multivariable quantile regression model examined whether continuous outcomes differed when controlling for suspected confounders. Between July 20, 2021 and November 30, 2023, 226 patients were randomized to either Stratafix barbed suture (n=113) or Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture (n=113) at the time of scheduled cesarean delivery. We observed no significant difference between the median quantified blood loss observed in the Stratafix barbed suture group (544.5 [250.7-838.8] mL) and the Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture group (600 [348-852] mL; P=.22). Median time to hysterotomy closure was 1.3 minutes shorter in the Stratafix barbed suture group (4.1[2.6-5.6] minutes) and the Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture group (5.4 [3.5-7.2] minutes; P<.001). In an a posteriori multivariable quantile regression adjusting for confounders, the median total quantified blood loss was not statistically significantly different between groups (P=.37). Median time to hysterotomy closure was 1.8 minutes shorter for the Stratafix barbed suture group (P<.01). The use of Stratafix barbed sutures was not associated with a reduction in blood loss compared with the Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture. However, the results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that Stratafix barbed suture may be associated with faster single-layer hysterotomy closure time. This suggests that Stratafix barbed suture could have benefits over Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture for the single-layer closure of hysterotomy during cesarean delivery. Any possible benefits of using Stratafix barbed suture at the time of hysterotomy closure during scheduled cesarean require further exploration.",

Changes between semaglutide and placebo groups over 26 weeks in total daily insulin dose (TDD), basal and bolus insulin doses, carbohydrate intake, and user-initiated bolus counts were analyzed using linear mixed models. Mediation analysis was used to attribute direct effects of semaglutide versus weight loss on insulin dose reduction. From baseline to week 26, there was a significant 22.6% reduction in TDD (95% CI -28.3 to -17.0), which was driven by greater reductions in bolus insulin (-30.5%; 95% CI -39.5 to -21.5) than basal insulin (-15.6%; 95% CI -21.5 to -9.7). The basal/TDD ratio increased from 0.56 to 0.62 (P < 0.001) and insulin dose (in units/kg/day) decreased from 0.72 to 0.60 (P < 0.001) in the semaglutide group. At week 4, an 83% (-11.1 U/day) reduction in TDD was due to a direct drug effect, and 17% (-2.3 U/day) was attributed to weight loss, whereas at week 26, the difference was split evenly between direct effect (-11.4 U/day; 52%) and weight loss (-10.5 U/day; 48%). Daily carbohydrate intake decreased from 137 g (95% CI 107-167) at baseline to 107 g (95% CI 76-137) at 26 weeks. Semaglutide produced rapid, sustained, and primarily bolus-driven insulin dose reductions, with early effects being largely independent of weight loss in adults with T1D and obesity.",

To investigate potential associations between prenatal exposure to acid-suppressive medication (histamine 2 [H2] receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors [PPIs]) and neuropsychiatric disorders in children. Retrospective cohort study of mother-child pairs in the South Korean National Health Insurance Service database with births from January 2010 through December 2017, with follow-up of offspring through December 2023. Analyses were conducted using a propensity score-based overlap-weighted cohort and a sibling-matched cohort. Prenatal exposure to at least 1 prescription for a PPI or H2 receptor antagonist. Offspring neuropsychiatric disorders identified via International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability, severe neuropsychiatric disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Of 3 012 992 mother-child pairs initially identified, 2 777 119 were included, with 507 845 pairs exposed to prenatal acid-suppressive medication and were followed up a mean of 10.3 (SD, 2.3) years. In the overlap-weighted cohort (403 658 mother-child pairs exposed and 403 659 pairs unexposed to an acid-suppressive medication), respective risks among offspring exposed vs not exposed were 4.85% vs 4.25% for ADHD, 1.45% vs 1.33% for ASD, 1.25% vs 1.09% for intellectual disability, 0.94% vs 0.81% for severe neuropsychiatric disorder, and 0.30% vs 0.27% for obsessive-compulsive disorder. In the overlap-weighted cohort, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) following prenatal acid-suppressive medication exposure was 1.14 (95% CI, 1.12-1.17) for ADHD, 1.07 (95% CI, 1.03-1.11) for ASD, 1.13 (95% CI, 1.09-1.18) for intellectual disability, 1.16 (95% CI, 1.10-1.21) for severe neuropsychiatric disorder, and 1.12 (95% CI, 1.03-1.21) for obsessive-compulsive disorder.

      "abstract": "Adolescent obesity is a global public health problem with multiple causes. The mainstay approach for managing obesity includes interventions targeting changes in health-related behaviours (diet, physical activity, and behaviour). However, previous research highlighted uncertainty about the sustainability and long-term results of these approaches. To assess the effects of multimodal health behaviour-changing interventions for adolescents aged 10 to 19 living with obesity. We used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, three other databases, and two trial registers, together with reference checking and contact with study authors, to identify studies included in the review. The latest search date was 28 February 2024. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adolescents aged 10 to 19 living with obesity that compared interventions involving a minimum of two health-related behaviour components (modifications in diet, physical activity, or behavioural change) to control (including no treatment, usual care, or waiting-list control) with a minimum of one year of follow-up. Critical outcomes included physical well-being, mental well-being, physical activity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), obesity-associated disability, adverse events, and anthropometry (body mass index (BMI) z-score). We used the original version of the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (RoB 1). We synthesised results for each outcome using meta-analysis, where possible, with a random-effects model. Where this was not possible, we described the results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for critical outcomes included in two key summary of findings tables. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMD). We included 33 RCTs with 5949 participants aged 10 to 19, primarily from high-income countries. We included 13 community-based interventions in schools, churches, and community centres, and 20 healthcare-based interventions implemented in primary care and hospitals. Intervention components included sessions on dietary modification, physical activity, and behavioural change. Of the 33 included studies, one targeted parents only, one involved only adolescents, and the remainder used family-based approaches, primarily through individual or group sessions. Healthcare-based multimodal interventions versus control Healthcare-based multimodal interventions may result in little to no difference in physical well-being at 12 months of follow-up (multiple scales: SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.39; I² = 67%; 4 studies, 1006 participants; low-certainty evidence). They may result in little to no difference in mental well-being at 12 to 18 months of follow-up (multiple scales: SMD 0.09, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.24; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 693 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of these interventions on self-reported physical activity (final score) at 12 months (multiple scales: SMD 0.51, 95% CI -0.07 to 1.10; I² = 93%; 4 studies, 964 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and when measured as a change-from-baseline score, these interventions may result in little to no difference in self-reported physical activity (multiple scales: SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.34; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 156 participants; low-certainty evidence). These interventions may slightly improve HRQoL at 12 months (multiple scales: SMD 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.24; I² = 4%; 7 studies, 1454 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of healthcare-based multimodal interventions on adverse events (0 events; 1 study, 46 participants; very low-certainty evidence). These interventions may result in little to no difference in BMI z-score at 12 to 18 months (MD -0.11, 95% CI -0.19 to -0.02; I² = 78%; 17 studies, 2666 participants; low-certainty evidence) and 24 months (MD 0.50, 95% CI -0.35 to 1.35; I² not applicable; 1 study, 33 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported obesity-associated disability. Community-based multimodal interventions versus control Community-based multimodal interventions may improve physical well-being at 12 months of follow-up (Youth Quality of Life instrument - Weight module: MD 13.50, 95% CI 4.99 to 22.01; I² not applicable; 1 study, 136 participants; low-certainty evidence). These interventions may result in little to no difference in mental well-being at 12 months (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire: MD 1.20, 95% CI -0.46 to 2.86; I² not applicable; 1 study, 208 participants; low-certainty evidence). These interventions may result in little to no difference in self-reported physical activity at 24 months (Global Physical Activity Questionnaire: ß coefficient = -0.04, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.2; P = 0.76; low-certainty evidence). Community-based multimodal interventions likely result in little to no difference in HRQoL at 12 months (multiple scales: SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.24; I² = 19%; 4 studies, 666 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and may result in little to no difference in HRQoL at 24 months (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory: SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.27; I² not applicable; 1 study, 188 participants; low-certainty evidence). These interventions may result in little to no difference in BMI z-score at 12 months (MD -0.07, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.08; I² = 85%; 5 studies, 585 participants; low-certainty evidence), and may reduce BMI z-score slightly at 24 months of follow-up (MD -0.47, 95% CI -0.96 to 0.02; I² = 98%; 3 studies, 430 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported data on obesity-associated disability or adverse events. Multimodal health behaviour-changing interventions may result in a small improvement in physical well-being at 12 months and BMI z-score at 12 months when delivered in the community, and in HRQoL at 12 months when delivered in healthcare settings. They may have little to no effect on other pre-defined critical outcomes, including mental well-being and physical activity. Future research should consider innovative approaches to the care of adolescents living with obesity and involve diverse populations, as we found limited research conducted in disadvantaged and culturally/ethnically diverse populations and other low-resource settings.

However, most treatments focus on symptom reduction without addressing the underlying biopsychosocial needs of patients. To determine the effectiveness of spinal manipulation and clinician-supported biopsychosocial self-management vs medical care for adults with increased risk of chronic disabling LBP. This 2 × 2 factorial randomized clinical trial enrolled participants in 3 research clinics at the Universities of Minnesota and Pittsburgh from November 2018 to May 2023; final follow-up was in June 2024. Adults with acute or subacute LBP at moderate to high risk of chronicity based on the STarT Back tool were randomized to 1 of 4 groups, with interventions lasting up to 8 weeks. Statistical analysis was conducted from November 2024 to June 2025. Spinal manipulation therapy (n = 201), supported self-management (n = 305), or combined supported self-management with spinal manipulation (n = 193) compared with guideline-based medical care (n = 301). Physical therapists and chiropractors provided spinal manipulation and supported self-management. The 2 primary outcomes averaged over a follow-up of 1 year were monthly low back disability (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) and weekly pain intensity (numerical rating scale). Secondary analysis examined the proportion of participants achieving a 50% or higher reduction in the primary outcome measures. Among the 1000 participants randomized (mean [SD] age, 47 [16] years; 58% female), 93% completed the trial. The omnibus test for differences across the 4 treatment groups was statistically significant for disability (P = .001; supported self-management, 4.7; spinal manipulation, 5.5; combined supported self-management with spinal manipulation, 4.8; medical care, 5.9) but not pain intensity (P = .16; supported self-management, 2.8; spinal manipulation, 3.0; combined supported self-management with spinal manipulation, 2.8; medical care, 3.0). Averaged over 12 months, LBP disability was significantly lower compared with medical care for supported self-management (mean difference, -1.2 [95% CI, -1.9 to -0.5]) and supported self-management with spinal manipulation (mean difference, -1.1 [95% CI, -1.9 to -0.3]) but not spinal manipulation alone (mean difference, -0.4 [95% CI, -1.2 to 0.4]). Group differences in pain intensity were not statistically significant; point estimates ranged from -0.2 to 0. Both supported self-management groups had higher proportions of patients achieving a 50% or greater reduction in disability (supported self-management, 67%; spinal manipulation, 54%; combined supported self-management with spinal manipulation, 65%; medical care, 54%). For patients with acute or subacute LBP at increased risk of chronic disabling LBP, clinician-supported biopsychosocial self-management showed statistically significant but small reductions in disability, but not pain, vs medical care over 1-year follow-up, and spinal manipulation alone showed no significant difference for either outcome.

This study examines whether the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 (LS7) metric developed for cardiovascular health is also linked to mortality outcomes in cancer survivors and explores potential biological mechanisms underlying this relationship. Longitudinal analyses were conducted on 779 cancer survivors from the Moli-sani study (n = 24 325), followed for 14.6 years (median). The LS7 metric includes smoking, physical activity, diet, body mass index, blood pressure, total blood cholesterol, and glucose. Each ideal metric was assigned 2 points, with scores ranging from 0 to 14. The LS7 score was categorized as poor (0-6), intermediate (7-9), and ideal (10-14) cardiovascular health. Shared biological risk factors (e.g. inflammatory and renal markers) were analysed as potential mediators. Cancer survivors in the ideal cardiovascular health category had a 38% lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to those with poor cardiovascular health [hazard ratio (HR) .62; 95% confidence interval (CI) .41-.94]. Similar findings were observed in cancer-free participants (HR .68; 95% CI .59-.78). Each 1-unit increase in LS7 metric was linked to lower cancer mortality (HR .90; 95% CI .82-.98). Replacing the original dietary component of the LS7 with the Mediterranean diet score resulted in reduced hazards of CVD (HR .84; 95% CI .71-1.00), cancer (HR .90; 95% CI .83-.98), and non-CVD/non-cancer mortality (e.g. deaths from neurodegenerative, cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases) (HR .83; 95% CI .70-.98). Altogether, inflammation, heart rate, and serum vitamin D accounted for over 50% of the associations between LS7 metric and mortality. The LS7 metric, originally developed for cardiovascular health, is associated with lower all-cause and cancer mortality in cancer survivors, potentially through shared biological mechanisms. These findings support the inclusion of LS7 risk factors in public health efforts targeting both CVD and cancer outcomes.",

To evaluate the effect and safety of glucocorticoid injections into the IPFP in individuals with inflammatory knee OA. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included patients aged 45 years and older with inflammatory knee OA at 4 centers in China. Patients were enrolled from April 2022 to June 2023. Patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group (n = 30) or placebo group (n = 30). Each group received either glucocorticoid or saline injections into the IPFP with hyaluronic acid as background treatment under ultrasonographic guidance. The primary outcomes were changes in knee pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) and effusion synovitis volume measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Secondary outcomes included changes in the total score of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), MRI-detected Hoffa synovitis score, quality of life assessed using the 4-dimensional Assessment of Quality of Life, pain medication use, IPFP volume, and the incidence of adverse reactions.

      "abstract": "To quantify and compare the rate of weight regain after cessation of weight management medications (WMMs) in adults with overweight or obesity. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Trial registries and databases (Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane, Web of Science, and trial registries) were searched from inception until February 2025 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised trials, and observational studies that included WMM (≥8 weeks) with follow-up for ≥4 weeks after cessation of treatment in adults with overweight or obesity. Comparators were any non-drug weight loss intervention or placebo. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Two independent reviewers screened titles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool for RCTs and the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomised trials. Data were analysed using mixed effect, meta-regression, and time-to-event models. Weight regain after cessation of WMM was compared with that reported after cessation of behavioural weight management programmes (BWMPs). The primary outcome was rate of weight regain from end of treatment, with associated changes in cardiometabolic markers as a secondary outcome. Of the 9288 titles screened, 37 studies (63 intervention arms, 9341 participants) were included. Average treatment duration was 39 (range 11-176) weeks, with average follow-up of 32 (4-104) weeks. The average monthly rate of weight regain was 0.4 kg (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3 to 0.5) (mixed model 0.3 kg (0.2 to 0.4) monthly  control in RCTs). All cardiometabolic markers were projected to return to baseline within 1.4 years after the cessation of WMM. Weight regain was faster after WMM than after BWMP (by 0.3 kg (0.22 to 0.34) monthly), independent of initial weight loss. Estimates and precision were robust in sensitivity analyses. This review found that cessation of WMM is followed by rapid weight regain and reversal of beneficial effects on cardiometabolic markers. Regain after WMM was faster than after BWMP. These findings suggest caution in short term use of these drugs without a more comprehensive approach to weight management. PROSPERO CRD42024532069.",

Two independent reviewers screened titles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool for RCTs and the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomised trials. Data were analysed using mixed effect, meta-regression, and time-to-event models. Weight regain after cessation of WMM was compared with that reported after cessation of behavioural weight management programmes (BWMPs)."
