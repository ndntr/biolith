      "abstract": "The safety and efficacy of intravenous thrombolytics beyond 4.5 hours after ischemic stroke onset remain inadequately studied. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous alteplase administered 4.5 to 24 hours after stroke onset in patients with salvageable brain tissue, regardless of the presence of large vessel occlusion. This randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial was conducted at 26 stroke centers across China. A total of 372 patients with acute ischemic stroke and salvageable brain tissue identified by perfusion imaging were enrolled between June 21, 2021, and June 30, 2024 (final follow-up October 2, 2024). Eligibility criteria included stroke onset (or the midpoint between last known well and symptom recognition if onset was unknown) of 4.5 to 24 hours prior to presentation, and no initial plan for endovascular thrombectomy. Data were analyzed from December 2024 to February 2025. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a minimization algorithm to receive intravenous alteplase (0.9 mg/kg; maximum dose, 90 mg; n = 186) or standard medical treatment (n = 186). The primary efficacy outcome was functional independence, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 at 90 days. Safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours and all-cause mortality within 90 days. Among 372 patients who were enrolled (median [IQR] age, 72 [64-80] years; 160 [43%] women), all completed the trial. The primary outcome occurred in 75 of 186 patients (40%) in the alteplase group and 49 of 186 (26%) in the control group (adjusted risk ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.14-2.02]; P = .004; unadjusted risk difference, 13.98% [95% CI, 4.50%-23.45%]). The incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was higher with alteplase at 3.8% compared with 0.51% with standard treatment (adjusted risk ratio, 7.34 [95% CI, 1.54-34.84]; P = .01; unadjusted risk difference, 3.23% [0.28%-6.19%]), and mortality was 11% in both groups (adjusted risk ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.52-1.62]; P = .76; unadjusted risk difference, 0% [95% CI, -6.30% to 6.30%]). In patients with acute ischemic stroke with salvageable brain tissue identified by perfusion imaging who did not initially receive thrombectomy, intravenous alteplase administered 4.5 to 24 hours after onset provided functional benefit, despite an increase in symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

Intravenous tropisetron (SUCRA=93.9%) is most likely superior for \"need for rescue drug\" (not needing rescue drug) (11 trials; n=1,465). Intravenous ondansetron (SUCRA=78.6%) is most likely superior for \"significant adverse reaction\" (not causing adverse reaction) (9 trials; n=1,267).

      "abstract": "Plague is a high-consequence infectious disease with epidemic potential. Current treatment guidelines are based on weak evidence. We enrolled persons (excluding pregnant persons) in Madagascar who had clinically suspected bubonic plague during 2020-2024. Using an open-label noninferiority design, we compared two treatments included in the national plague guidelines: oral ciprofloxacin for 10 days (ciprofloxacin monotherapy) or injectable aminoglycoside for 3 days followed by oral ciprofloxacin for 7 days (aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin). The primary end point was treatment failure on day 11, with treatment failure defined as death, fever, secondary pneumonic plague, or alternative or prolonged plague treatment. To show noninferiority of ciprofloxacin monotherapy among patients with laboratory-confirmed or probable infections, the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval around the risk difference had to be less than 15 percentage points. A total of 933 patients underwent screening; 450 patients with suspected bubonic plague were enrolled and underwent randomization. A total of 220 patients (110 per group) had confirmed infection, and 2 (1 per group) had probable infection. Of the patients who underwent randomization, 53.2% were male, and the median age was 14 years (range, 2 to 72). Ciprofloxacin monotherapy was noninferior to aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin therapy: among the patients with confirmed or probable infection, treatment failure occurred in 9.0% (10 of 111 patients) in the ciprofloxacin monotherapy group and 8.1% (9 of 111 patients) in the aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin group (difference, 0.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -6.0 to 7.8). Noninferiority was consistent in other prespecified analysis populations. A total of 5 patients in the ciprofloxacin monotherapy group and 4 patients in the aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin group died, and secondary pneumonic plague developed in 3 patients in each group. The incidence of adverse events among patients with confirmed or probable infections was similar in the two groups - 18.0% in the ciprofloxacin monotherapy group and 18.9% in the aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin group had adverse events, and 7.2% and 5.4%, respectively, had serious adverse events. Oral ciprofloxacin monotherapy for 10 days was noninferior to an aminoglycoside-ciprofloxacin sequential combination for the treatment of patients with bubonic plague.

In-trial (2010-17) and post-trial (2017-22) data were analysed.

However, during the post-trial period (median 4.3 years), there was a higher rate of MACE (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01, 1.36) in those randomized to aspirin compared with placebo. Over the entire period, a higher rate of major haemorrhage was observed in the randomized aspirin group compared with placebo (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10, 1.39). The present study provides novel evidence concerning long-term MACE and haemorrhage following aspirin use in initially healthy older adults.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled RCTs focusing on GLP-1RA use in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or obesity. Five databases were searched from inception to October 2024. The primary outcome was VTE, which was a composite of pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis, and VTE at other sites, and the secondary outcomes were the individual events. Twenty-seven RCTs with 84 003 patients were analyzed. The median incidence of VTE was 1.1 and 2.5 per 1000 patient-years in the GLP-1RA and placebo groups, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in overall VTE risk between GLP-1RA and placebo groups (risk ratio [RR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.46-1.07). However, GLP-1RAs were associated with a significantly lower risk of PE (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39-0.94). In contrast, there were no significant differences in the risk of deep vein thrombosis (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.69-2.12) or VTE at other sites (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.25-1.26).

To assess the efficacy and safety of stapokibart as an add-on treatment to intranasal corticosteroids in patients with severe uncontrolled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. From August 9, 2022, to April 28, 2023, this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 clinical trial, conducted at 51 hospitals in China, enrolled adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps who had a history of systemic corticosteroid use or sinonasal surgery and a bilateral nasal polyp score of 5 or greater (on a scale of 0-8) and a weekly mean nasal congestion score of 2 or greater (on a scale of 0-3). Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps was defined as blood eosinophils of 6.9% or greater (without asthma) or 3.7% or greater (with asthma) or an eosinophil count of 55 per high-power field or greater or 27% or greater in nasal polyp tissue. Patient follow-up was completed on June 25, 2024. Four weeks after initiation of mometasone furoate nasal spray, 100 µg in each nostril daily, patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous stapokibart, 300 mg, or placebo (1:1) every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. Both groups then received stapokibart for 28 weeks. Co-primary end points were changes from baseline in nasal polyp score (meaningful change threshold [MCT] ≥1 point) and nasal congestion score (MCT ≥0.5 points) at week 24 in all patients and in the population with eosinophilia. Among 180 patients randomized, 179 (mean age, 45 [SD, 12.9] years; 61 [34.1%] women) received at least 1 treatment dose (n = 90 for stapokibart; n = 89 for placebo). In the overall population, the least-squares (LS) mean change in nasal polyp score from baseline to week 24 in the stapokibart vs placebo groups was -2.6 vs -0.3 points, respectively, (LS mean difference, -2.3; 95% CI, -2.6 to -1.9; P < .001); in the population with eosinophilia, the change was -3.0 vs -0.4 points, respectively (LS mean difference, -2.5; 95% CI, -2.9 to -2.1; P < .001). The LS mean change in nasal congestion score from baseline to week 24 in the stapokibart vs placebo groups was -1.2 vs -0.5 points, respectively, in the overall population (LS mean difference, -0.7; 95% CI, -0.9 to -0.5; P < .001) and -1.3 vs -0.5 points, respectively, in the population with eosinophilia (LS mean difference, -0.8; 95% CI, -1.0 to -0.6; P < .001). Serious adverse events were rare (2.2% in the stapokibart group vs 1.1% in the placebo group). Higher rates of arthralgia (7.8% vs 0%) and hyperuricemia (5.6% vs 1.1%) were reported with stapokibart vs placebo, respectively. Among patients with severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps treated with a daily intranasal corticosteroid, stapokibart reduced polyp size and severity of nasal symptoms at 24 weeks.

Participants, randomised 1:1, received oxytocin 2.5 IU or carbetocin 100 μg intravenously immediately after delivery. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in cardiac troponin I (cTnI) serum concentration at 6-10 h postpartum. Secondary endpoints included blood loss, uterine tone (numerical rating scale 0-10), rescue treatment, and healthcare costs 48 h postpartum. 215 patients underwent a planned caesarean delivery and received their allocated study drug (oxytocin group, n = 112; carbetocin group, n = 103). We detected no difference in median change from baseline cTnI concentration at 6-10 h postpartum (0.0 [95% CI -1.09 to 1.09] ng/L; p = 1.00). Median (interquartile range [IQR]) estimated blood loss was similar: oxytocin, 395 (96 to 627) mL; carbetocin, 335 (127 to 570) mL (group difference: -41 mL [95% CI -158 to 76]; p = 0.49).
