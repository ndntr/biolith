      "abstract": "Although betamethasone reduces complications of prematurity, it can cause maternal hyperglycemia and neonatal hypoglycemia. Metformin effectively treats maternal hyperglycemia and has been shown to decrease neonatal hypoglycemia in women with gestational diabetes. To evaluate the impact of metformin treatment after betamethasone administration on maternal glycemic control and the incidence of neonatal hypoglycemia in preterm infants. This multicenter, open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted from July 1, 2020, to June 30, 2024, at 3 medical centers in Israel. Pregnant women receiving betamethasone from 24.0 to 36.5 gestational weeks due to increased preterm delivery risk were studied. Women with diabetes were excluded. Participants were randomized to metformin (425 mg 3 times daily before meals and 850-1700 mg at 10 pm) or no treatment. The treatment lasted up to 48 hours after the first betamethasone dose. Capillary glucose was measured before meals (preprandial), 90 minutes after starting meals (postprandial), and at 10 pm. The primary end points were the mean maternal glucose values up to 48 hours from first betamethasone injection and the rate of neonatal hypoglycemia in preterm deliveries (<37 gestational weeks). A total of 169 women (mean [SD] age, 29.7 [5.4] years), including 84 with 48 preterm infants in the metformin group and 85 with 58 preterm neonates in the control group, were included in the study. Mean (SD) maternal total and postprandial glucose values were significantly lower in the metformin group (121 [15] vs 127 [17] mg/dL; P = .01; and 129 [22] vs 138 [26] mg/dL; P = .009, respectively). Neonatal hypoglycemia rate was lower in the metformin group (10 [21%] vs 23 [40%]; P = .04; relative risk, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28-0.99). Mild adverse effects, mostly gastrointestinal, were reported by 12 women (14%). In this randomized clinical trial, metformin was safe and effective in preventing betamethasone-induced maternal hyperglycemia and neonatal hypoglycemia. Metformin should be considered as a treatment option for women who receive antenatal corticosteroids to prevent their related adverse effects. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04332393.",

Evidence from randomized, controlled trials in children and adolescents is needed. We randomly assigned participants 6 to 17 years of age with a diagnosis of episodic migraine (defined as migraine for ≥6 months and a history of ≤14 headache days per month) to receive monthly subcutaneous injections of fremanezumab (120 mg for participants with a body weight of <45 kg and 225 mg for those with a body weight of ≥45 kg) or matched placebo for 3 months. Participants were allowed to use migraine-specific medications to treat acute headaches. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the average number of migraine days per month. Key secondary end points included the change in the number of days per month with headache of at least moderate severity and a reduction of 50% or more in the number of migraine days per month. Of 237 participants who underwent randomization, 234 were included in the full analysis population: 123 in the fremanezumab group (36 received the 120-mg dose and 87 received the 225-mg dose) and 111 in the placebo group. Fremanezumab reduced the number of migraine days per month by 2.5 as compared with 1.4 with placebo (difference, 1.1; P = 0.02) and the number of days per month with headache of at least moderate severity by 2.6 as compared with 1.5 with placebo (difference, 1.1; P = 0.02). The percentage of participants who had a reduction of 50% or more in the number of migraine days per month was 47.2% with fremanezumab and 27.0% with placebo (P = 0.002). Injection-site erythema was the most common adverse event with fremanezumab (9.8% of participants, vs. 5.4% with placebo). Among children and adolescents with episodic migraine, fremanezumab resulted in greater reductions in the number of migraine days and headache days than placebo.

This is a multisite, double-blind, gestational-age stratified superiority trial that compared cabergoline 1 mg once with placebo for preventing bothersome breast symptoms immediately after uterine evacuation. We enrolled pregnant people at 16-20 weeks of gestation who were English- or Spanish-speaking and without contraindication to the study drug. Participants received cabergoline within 4 hours of uterine evacuation or fetal expulsion and, at baseline and at multiple time points through 2 weeks postprocedure, completed a validated electronic survey that assessed breast symptoms, side effects, and bother. Our primary outcome was breast symptoms (a composite of engorgement, milk leakage, tenderness, and need for pain relief) on day 4; we planned to enroll 30 participants in each gestational duration strata to show a 40% difference in breast symptoms (80% power, α=0.049). After screening 145 patients from February 2024 through May 2025, we enrolled 69 eligible participants. Baseline demographics were balanced between groups: Median gestational duration was 18 weeks (range 16 0/7-19 6/7 weeks), 53.0% were nulliparous, 63.6% self-identified as Hispanic, and 68.2% had public insurance. On day 4, significantly fewer participants who received cabergoline reported any breast symptoms compared with placebo (50.0% vs 88.2%, P<.001) (primary outcome) and fewer participants reported significant bother from breast symptoms (3.1% vs 20.6%, P=.05) (secondary outcome).

A multicenter, single-blind, randomized, noninferiority trial. Fifteen ICUs across China between October 2021 and November 2023. Adults under endotracheal intubation MV who were expected to require sedation for 8-48 hours. Three hundred fourteen patients were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to the remimazolam besylate or dexmedetomidine group. Analgesia was provided via a continuous IV infusion of remifentanil at 1.2-9.0 µg/kg/hr. Remimazolam besylate or dexmedetomidine was administered IV at an initial loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 0.10-0.30 mg/kg/hr or at an initial loading dose of 0.20 µg/kg followed by a maintenance dose of 0.2-0.70 µg/kg/hr to achieve the targeted sedation range on the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale of -2 to +1. Of the 314 patients enrolled, 299 completed the study. The sedation efficacy rates, as the primary endpoint, were 82.6% and 83.2% in remimazolam besylate and dexmedetomidine groups, respectively, in the per-protocol set (PPS), whereas the rate was 72.9% in both groups in the intention-to-treat (ITT) set. The noninferiority margin was set as 10%, and the lower limits of the two-sided 95% CI for the intergroup difference were -3.0% and -2.6% in the PPS and ITT sets, respectively.

To evaluate the effect and safety of glucocorticoid injections into the IPFP in individuals with inflammatory knee OA. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included patients aged 45 years and older with inflammatory knee OA at 4 centers in China. Patients were enrolled from April 2022 to June 2023. Patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group (n = 30) or placebo group (n = 30). Each group received either glucocorticoid or saline injections into the IPFP with hyaluronic acid as background treatment under ultrasonographic guidance. The primary outcomes were changes in knee pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) and effusion synovitis volume measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Secondary outcomes included changes in the total score of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), MRI-detected Hoffa synovitis score, quality of life assessed using the 4-dimensional Assessment of Quality of Life, pain medication use, IPFP volume, and the incidence of adverse reactions. Outcomes were assessed over 12 weeks. All 60 participants (mean [SD] age, 65 [11] years; 38 [63%] women) completed the study. The treatment group compared with the placebo group did not have a statistically significant reduction in VAS pain (-39.3 mm vs -31.4 mm; between-group difference, -7.9 mm; 95% CI, -19.7 to 4.0 mm). There was no significant between-group difference in effusion volume reduction (-4.9 mL vs -5.4 mL; between-group difference, 0.5 mL; 95% CI, -1.9 to 2.9 mL). In post hoc analyses, the treatment group had significantly greater reduction in the WOMAC pain score (-113.0 points vs -66.8 points; between group difference, -46.2 points; 95% CI, -90.0 to -2.4 points; P = .04) and cartilage defect (-0.1 vs 0.4; between-group difference, -0.5; 95% CI, -1.0 to -0.1; P = .03). Both groups had 1 participant who experienced 1 adverse reaction. In this randomized clinical trial, glucocorticoid injections into the IPFP did not effectively alleviate knee pain or reduce effusion synovitis volume in inflammatory knee OA.

However, two-thirds of children experience inadequate pain relief with ibuprofen monotherapy, and the efficacy of additive medications for moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain is unclear. To determine whether treatment with an opioid (hydromorphone) plus ibuprofen or nonopioid (acetaminophen [paracetamol]) plus ibuprofen decreased pain scores compared with ibuprofen alone. Two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trials were conducted from April 2019 to March 2023 in 6 university-affiliated, tertiary care Canadian pediatric emergency departments. Children aged 6 to 17 years presenting with a nonoperative acute limb injury (<24 hours) and a verbal numerical rating scale (vNRS) pain score of 5 or more out of 10 were enrolled. Date of final follow-up was March 22, 2023. The opioid trial randomized participants to a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus hydromorphone, ibuprofen plus acetaminophen, or ibuprofen alone. The nonopioid trial randomized participants to a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus acetaminophen or ibuprofen alone. In all groups, ibuprofen was dosed at 10 mg/kg (maximum, 600 mg). The acetaminophen dose was 15 mg/kg (maximum, 1000 mg), and the hydromorphone dose was 0.05 mg/kg (maximum, 5 mg). The primary efficacy outcome was self-reported vNRS pain score at 60 minutes post medication administration (score range, 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst pain]; minimal clinically important difference, 1.5). The primary safety end point was the proportion of children with any adverse event related to study drug administration. A total of 8098 children were screened for eligibility; 699 were randomized and 653 were included in the efficacy analyses. The opioid trial included 249 children: 110 randomized to ibuprofen plus hydromorphone, 70 to ibuprofen plus acetaminophen, and 69 to ibuprofen alone. The nonopioid trial included 450 children: 225 randomized to a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus acetaminophen and 225 randomized to ibuprofen alone.

No serious adverse events occurred. For children with acute nonoperative musculoskeletal injury, pain scores at 60 minutes after drug administration did not improve with ibuprofen plus acetaminophen or ibuprofen plus hydromorphone compared with ibuprofen alone.

In this investigator-initiated, prospective, multicenter, double-blind randomized trial, participants were randomized early after HT to receive either alirocumab or placebo in addition to rosuvastatin. Before randomization and at 1 year, all participants underwent invasive coronary assessment, including angiography, fractional flow reserve, coronary flow reserve, the index of microcirculatory resistance, and intravascular ultrasound with near-infrared spectroscopy. Lipid values were assessed at baseline and at prespecified intervals. The primary end point was the change in coronary artery plaque volume from baseline to 1 year after HT based on serial intravascular ultrasound. A total of 114 HT recipients were included (57 assigned to alirocumab and 57 assigned to placebo). Baseline characteristics were well matched between the 2 groups. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased significantly from baseline to 1 year in the alirocumab arm (72.7±31.7 to 31.5±20.7 mg/dL; <0.001) and did not change with placebo (69.0±22.4 to 69.2±28.1 mg/dL; =0.92).

There were no significant adverse events related to alirocumab. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibition with alirocumab in addition to statin therapy early after HT safely lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but did not reduce coronary artery plaque progression after 1 year compared with rosuvastatin alone in patients with a low baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, as the initial diagnostic test for tuberculosis (TB). However, the effect of these tests on key health outcomes is not well-established. To assess the effects of three classes of rapid NAATs-low-complexity automated (LC-aNAATs), low-complexity manual (LC-mNAATs) and moderate-complexity automated (MC-aNAATs)-compared with smear microscopy or bacterial culture on patient outcomes in people investigated for TB, irrespective of age or disease severity. Our secondary objective was to assess the effects of the three classes of rapid NAATs in vulnerable populations such as children and people living with HIV, to inform health equity considerations. We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, five other electronic bibliographic databases, and two trial registries, from 1900 up to 21 January 2025. We also checked reference lists of included articles and relevant systematic reviews to identify additional studies. We contacted manufacturers, researchers, and experts working on new diagnostic tests for TB through a WHO public call for data, which lasted from 30 November 2023 to 15 February 2024. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that involved children and adults of any age who were suspected to have TB (i.e. 'presumptive TB'). We included both individually randomised and cluster-randomised designs. In terms of the intervention, we considered \"design-locked, marketed test technologies\" (i.e. testing technologies with designs that have been finalised and are currently being sold or promoted in the healthcare market) by class and tests provided by the WHO: LC-aNAATs (e.g. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, Truenat MTB Plus, Truenat MTB-RIF Dx); LC-mNAATs (e.g. TB-LAMP); and MC-aNAATs (e.g. FluoroType XDR-TB). We restricted comparative strategies to smear microscopy and bacterial culture methods. We excluded studies on standard Xpert MTB/RIF, which has been superseded by the Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra test. Our critical outcomes were all-cause mortality from the time of the first diagnostic test to the end of the trial follow-up, and cure rates among people with bacteriologically-confirmed TB at the beginning of treatment and who completed treatment with no evidence of failure. Our important outcomes were the proportion of participants lost to follow-up, time to TB diagnosis, and time to treatment initiation. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for all reported outcomes in the included studies using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2). Disagreements were resolved through discussion or by consulting a senior review author as needed. We could not combine the results statistically because the included studies measured, defined, or reported outcomes differently. As a result, we presented the findings from each study in tables, forest plots, and using narrative descriptions. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome using GRADEpro GDT software. Of the 2231 records identified by our search, we included two trials (reported in three articles) in the review. The trials compared an LC-aNAAT (Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra) with smear microscopy and involved 11,228 adults aged 18 years and above. One was an individually randomised trial and one was cluster-randomised. Both trials were conducted in Africa (one in South Africa and the other in Uganda). One trial assessed all-cause mortality at six and 18 months, loss-to-follow-up, and the time taken to diagnose TB, while the other assessed the time taken to initiate treatment. Whether Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra or smear microscopy was used to detect TB made little to no difference to all-cause mortality at six months (risk ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.01; 1 RCT, 8116 participants; high-certainty evidence) and 18 months (adjusted rate ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 1.29; 1 RCT, 8413 participants; high-certainty evidence). Neither study assessed how the test used affects the likelihood of curing TB. One trial (XPEL-TB 2021) reported a slightly higher risk of loss to follow-up with Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (13.6%) than with smear microscopy (10.1%), with a risk ratio of 1.35 (95% CI 1.20 to 1.51; 1 RCT, 9563 participants; high-certainty evidence). A testing strategy that includes Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra probably results in a reduction in time to diagnosis (adjusted geometric mean ratio 0.49, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.62; 1 RCT, 10,644 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and a similar reduction in time to treatment (adjusted geometric mean ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.58; 1 RCT, 10,644 participants; hazard ratio 3.00, 95% CI 1.18 to 7.60; 1 RCT, 584 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence in this review is limited by sparse data, a lack of some key outcomes (specifically, cure), the use of varied effect measures, and the exclusion of paediatric populations. While we graded the evidence as moderate certainty for time to diagnosis and treatment initiation, serious concerns about the risk of bias and the narrow scope restrict the applicability and generalisability of the evidence to other NAATs and patient outcomes. Based on limited evidence from two trials that compared Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra to smear microscopy, the use of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra to test for TB makes little to no difference to all-cause mortality at six and 18 months. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra probably decreases the time taken to diagnose TB and time to treatment initiation. The use of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra increases the risk of loss to follow-up compared with smear microscopy. There were no data on the effects of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra compared with smear microscopy or culture on tuberculosis cure rates. This Cochrane review was funded by the World Health Organization (WHO).

We searched many electronic databases up to 10 October 2025 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies. We included studies enrolling adults with type 2 diabetes and PAD, comparing GLP-1RAs against placebo or other glucose-lowering drugs. The primary outcomes were walking distance, MALE, or LEA. Data were pooled using a random-effects model, with hazard ratios (HR) or risk ratios (RR). Risk of bias was assessed using RoB2 for RCTs and ROBINS-I for cohort studies; evidence certainty was evaluated using the GRADE approach. We included seven studies (3 RCTs, 4 cohorts) enrolling 107 092 participants. The meta-analysis of two RCTs with 847 participants demonstrated a significant improvement in walking distance with liraglutide or semaglutide (HR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.15, p < 0.001), with no heterogeneity (I = 0.0%) and moderate certainty of evidence. In the additional meta-analysis of two RCTs with 3592 participants, the incidence of MALE or LEA did not differ significantly between patients receiving exenatide or semaglutide and those receiving placebo. The meta-analysis of four cohort studies with 104 292 participants showed that GLP-1RAs reduced the risk of LEA (RR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.39-0.73, p < 0.001), with high heterogeneity (I = 85.96%), totally related to one study, and very low certainty of evidence. Subgroup analyses showed a significant difference (p < 0.001) between GLP-1RA therapies, with the strongest associations with LEA reduction for tirzepatide and semaglutide (55% and 54% risk reduction, respectively); there was no difference in the LEA outcome excluding from the analysis patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers at baseline. This meta-analysis suggests that GLP-1RAs are associated with a significant improvement in functional walking distance and a reduction in the risk of LEA in people with type 2 and PAD.

The high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV) has demonstrated superior efficacy against influenza infection compared with the standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV) among adults 65 years or older. However, there is limited evidence on its effectiveness in preventing severe respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with diabetes. To investigate the relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of HD-IIV vs SD-IIV against severe respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes according to diabetes status and across diabetes subgroups. This was a prespecified secondary analysis of DANFLU-2, a pragmatic, open-label, individually randomized clinical trial conducted in Denmark during the 2022/2023 to 2024/2025 influenza seasons. Adults 65 years or older were eligible for inclusion regardless of comorbidities. Data were obtained from nationwide health registries and analyzed from June to October 2025. Participants were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive HD-IIV or SD-IIV. Outcomes included respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations. The potential effect modification by diabetes status and across diabetes subgroups was tested. Among 332 438 participants (mean [SD] age, 73.7 [5.8] years; 161 538 female individuals [48.6%]), 43 881 (13.2%) had diabetes.

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes is highly prevalent, and many adults, especially those not using insulin, struggle to reach HbA1c targets. This review aimed to evaluate the effect of self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Scopus from January 2014 to May 2025 for systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials enrolling adults with type 2 diabetes that evaluated SMBG or CGM versus no monitoring or SMBG, respectively. Fifteen systematic reviews comprising 81 unique studies and 23 657 participants were included. Reviews comparing SMBG with no monitoring demonstrated a modest but significant reduction in HbA1c (MD -0.23%, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.18; I = 21%). Reviews directly comparing CGM with SMBG showed greater HbA1c reduction with CGM (MD -0.29%, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.24; I = 0%). Subgroup analyses for SMBG indicated consistent benefits across follow-up duration, monitoring structure, and study quality, although heterogeneity was high in some comparisons. Subgroup analyses for CGM types found both isCGM/FGM (MD -0.27%, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.11) and rtCGM (MD -0.36%, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.27) superior to SMBG. These findings support glucose monitoring for optimizing glycaemic management and outcomes. Further investment in cost-effectiveness studies is warranted to assess broader implementation in this population.",

Index cases; adults and children weighing >15 kg with scabies, confirmed by dermoscopy. Index cases were randomly assigned to the ivermectin group or permethrin group (1:1 ratio). Each member of the cluster, defined as the household of each index case, received the same treatment as the index case, except for children weighing <15 kg who were prescribed topical 5% permethrin. All participants received oral ivermectin 200 µg/kg or 5% permethrin cream on day 0 and day 10. Permethrin cream was applied to the whole body, from head to toe. The primary outcome was clinical cure of the cluster on day 28 (ie, disappearance of clinical signs and symptoms of scabies for all cluster members). Secondary outcomes were index case and individual level analyses and safety. Dermatologists were used as assessors and were masked to the treatment. 507 participants in 142 households (clusters) were treated with ivermectin and 568 participants in 147 households received permethrin. Cluster level cure rates were 71.8% versus 88.5% (-16.7 percentage point difference, 95% confidence interval (CI) -26.3 to -7.1) for ivermectin versus permethrin.

STORM-PE (A Prospective, Multicenter, Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating Anticoagulation Alone Versus Anticoagulation Plus Mechanical Aspiration With the Indigo Aspiration System for the Treatment of Intermediate-High Risk Acute Pulmonary Embolism) is the first reported randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy and to evaluate the safety of mechanical thrombectomy, specifically computer-assisted vacuum thrombectomy (CAVT) with anticoagulation compared to anticoagulation alone. STORM-PE is an international randomized controlled trial with 1:1 randomization to CAVT with anticoagulation or anticoagulation alone.

Among 687 patients, PSC showed higher predictive performance than IPSCC sepsis criteria, with improved sensitivity and PPV for mortality on day 1 (PSC: sensitivity, 96.4%; 95% CI, 95.0-97.8%; PPV, 7.6%; 95% CI, 5.6-9.6% and IPSCC: sensitivity, 82.1%; 95% CI, 79.3-85.0%; PPV, 6.2%; 95% CI, 4.4-8.0%) and day 2 (PSC: sensitivity, 100.0%; 95% CI, 100.0-100.0%; PPV, 10.0%; 95% CI, 7.6-12.5% and IPSCC: sensitivity, 75.0%; 95% CI, 71.5-78.5%; PPV, 9.0%; 95% CI, 6.7-11.3%). PELOD-2 exhibited the highest AUPRC for mortality (day 1, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.26-0.63 and day 2, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38-0.77). IPSCC Severe Sepsis score was outperformed by all other organ dysfunction scores, including PSS and Phoenix-8. All prognostic performances improved from day 1 to day 2."

Measurement and diagnostic accuracy study (exploring pulse oximeter accuracy across skin tones-EXAKT). Twenty four intensive care units in England between June 2022 and August 2024. 903 critically ill adults admitted to intensive care units screened for or enrolled into a trial evaluating different approaches to oxygen therapy. Pulse oximetry derived peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO) measurements were compared with paired arterial oxygen saturation (SaO) measurements from arterial blood analysed by co-oximetry (gold standard). Skin tone (individual typology angle) was objectively measured using a handheld spectrophotometer. Pulse oximeter measurement accuracy was assessed for bias, precision, and overall accuracy. Diagnostic accuracy for identifying SaO ≤92% was assessed by false negative and false positive rates for SpO using thresholds of ≤92% and ≤94%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and by the presence of occult hypoxaemia (SaO <88% with SpO >92%). 11 018 paired SpO-SaO measurements were analysed. All tested pulse oximeters overestimated at lower values and underestimated at higher values of SaO. On average, SpO readings were 0.6-1.5 percentage points higher for patients with darker skin tone (individual typology angle -44°) than for those with lighter skin tone (46°). At both SpO thresholds assessed, false negative rates increased with darker skin tones; the proportion of SpO measurements >94% despite a paired SaO ≤92% ranged from 5.3 to 35.3 percentage points higher for patients with darker skin tones than for those with lighter skin tones (7.6-62.2%  1.2-26.9%, rate ratio 2.3-7.1). By contrast, false positive rates decreased with darker skin tones. Five pulse oximeters provided by the NHS England COVID Oximetry @home scheme yielded higher SpO measurements for patients with darker skin tones compared with those with lighter skin tones, which could translate into potentially clinically important differences in false negative and false positive rates for detecting hypoxaemia.

Physical activity based interventions ranked highest (mean rank 1.1, 95% CI 1 to 2) in preventing gestational diabetes."

Given the primary treatment goal to improve patients' health status, defining the incremental benefits of aficamten over metoprolol on patients' symptoms, function, and quality of life is needed. In this study, the authors sought to compare patient-reported health status benefits of aficamten with metoprolol. Adults with symptomatic oHCM (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ] Clinical Summary Score [CSS] ≤90; left ventricular outflow tract obstruction ≥30 mm Hg at rest or ≥50 mm Hg with Valsalva) were randomly assigned to 24 weeks of aficamten or metoprolol as monotherapy. Changes in KCCQ Overall Summary Score (OSS) and Seattle Angina Questionnaire Summary Score (SAQ-SS), collected serially throughout the trial, were compared between treatment groups at 24 weeks using linear regression, adjusted for randomization strata and baseline scores. Individual participant experiences were described by comparing categories of clinically meaningful within-participant change: ≤-5 (worse), >-5 to <+5 (no change), +5 to <+10 (small improvement), +10 to <+15 (moderate improvement), +15 to <+20 (large improvement), and ≥+20 points (very large improvement). Among 175 randomized patients, baseline health status scores were similar between treatment groups (n = 88 aficamten; n = 87 metoprolol). Aficamten, compared with metoprolol, resulted in a greater 24-week KCCQ-OSS improvement (adjusted between-group difference: +7.8 points; 95% CI: 3.3-12.3; P < 0.001), primarily driven by a greater proportion of aficamten-treated (38.6%) vs metoprolol-treated (18.4%) patients experiencing a very large (≥20 points) KCCQ-OSS improvement (number needed to treat = 4.9; 95% CI: 3.0-13.9), and a smaller proportion experiencing worsening health status (≤-5-point change: 6.8% vs 18.4%; number needed to harm = 8.6; 95% CI: 4.7-53.3). Nonsignificant SAQ-SS improvements with aficamten vs metoprolol (+4.6 points; 95% CI -0.3 to 9.5 points; P = 0.063) were driven by significantly larger improvements in the SAQ Physical Limitation scale (+10.1 points; 95% CI: 3.9-16.2 points; P = 0.001).

      "abstract": "Emergency Medical Services (EMS) patients with chest pain are often suspected of having non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). Current risk stratification protocols for NSTE-ACS have limitations, leading to a lack of a well-organised prehospital diagnostic pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated that using clinical risk scores (CRS) including point-of-care (POC)-troponin in the EMS can improve prehospital diagnostic pathways for suspected NSTE-ACS. The primary aim of this systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis was to assess safety of low-risk stratification for suspected NSTE-ACS patients in the prehospital setting. Prospective studies using CRS or POC-troponin for risk stratification in suspected NSTE-ACS patients within the EMS setting were included. Safety was assessed using sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) for patients identified as low risk, based on CRS or POC-troponin measurement, for three different endpoints within 30 days: (1) all-cause mortality, (2) composite of mortality and/or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), (3) major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Of 1526 articles screened, 6 were included, comprising 5.239 patients, and all utilised CRS derived from the History, ECG, Age, Risk-factor and Troponin (HEART) score. The summary of low-risk CRS diagnostic performance predicted all-cause mortality with a sensitivity of 93.2% (83.5-98.1) and NPV of 99.8% (99.5-99.9); mortality and/or AMI with a sensitivity of 91.8% (83.0-96.2) and an NPV of 97.3% (89.9-99.3); and MACE with a sensitivity of 92.8% (88.7-95.5) and an NPV of 97.2% (92.1-99.0). Lowering the CRS cut-off value for identifying low-risk patients increased sensitivity and NPV but decreased the proportion of patients classified as low risk. In well-trained EMS systems, where prompt and accurate follow-up of low-risk patients is possible, HEART-derived CRS effectively identify patients with a very low risk of 30-day mortality and MACE. However, implementation in other healthcare systems requires additional validation, given the variations in healthcare structure, risk stratification processes and follow-up capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Reducing blood loss at the time of scheduled cesarean improves maternal outcomes. Type of suture material and closure technique may contribute to reduction in blood loss specifically related to the incision site as well as more expeditiously achieve uterine contractility. Prior publications have noted reduced closure times when using knotless barbed suture, but available evidence remains limited. To examine whether patients whose hysterotomies were closed with Stratafix barbed suture at the time of scheduled cesarean delivery had lower quantified blood loss compared to patients who received Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture. This was a prospective randomized clinical trial at a single tertiary care center in New York City. Patients with a scheduled primary or repeat cesarean delivery ≥37.0 weeks' gestation provided informed consent and were randomized to either Stratafix barbed suture or Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture for hysterotomy closure. The primary outcome was quantified blood loss, measured in milliliters using the mobile Stryker Triton artificial intelligence scanner. Secondary outcomes included (1) single-layer hysterotomy closure time, (2) use of additional hemostatic sutures, (3) intraoperative use of hemostatic agents, (4) rate of surgical site infection (including endometritis), and (5) differences in average postoperative pain. The Mann-Whitney U test compared observed medians of continuous outcomes between groups. Chi-squared tests compared proportional differences in categorical outcomes between groups. An a posteriori multivariable quantile regression model examined whether continuous outcomes differed when controlling for suspected confounders. Between July 20, 2021 and November 30, 2023, 226 patients were randomized to either Stratafix barbed suture (n=113) or Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture (n=113) at the time of scheduled cesarean delivery. We observed no significant difference between the median quantified blood loss observed in the Stratafix barbed suture group (544.5 [250.7-838.8] mL) and the Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture group (600 [348-852] mL; P=.22). Median time to hysterotomy closure was 1.3 minutes shorter in the Stratafix barbed suture group (4.1[2.6-5.6] minutes) and the Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture group (5.4 [3.5-7.2] minutes; P<.001). In an a posteriori multivariable quantile regression adjusting for confounders, the median total quantified blood loss was not statistically significantly different between groups (P=.37). Median time to hysterotomy closure was 1.8 minutes shorter for the Stratafix barbed suture group (P<.01). The use of Stratafix barbed sutures was not associated with a reduction in blood loss compared with the Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture. However, the results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that Stratafix barbed suture may be associated with faster single-layer hysterotomy closure time. This suggests that Stratafix barbed suture could have benefits over Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture for the single-layer closure of hysterotomy during cesarean delivery. Any possible benefits of using Stratafix barbed suture at the time of hysterotomy closure during scheduled cesarean require further exploration.",

      "abstract": "In this post hoc analysis, we used the data from the Adjunct Semaglutide Treatment in Type 1 Diabetes (ADJUST-T1D) trial, a double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of semaglutide 1 mg/week in adults with type 1 diabetes [[T1D]and obesity), to evaluate the relationship between insulin dose reduction and weight loss. Changes between semaglutide and placebo groups over 26 weeks in total daily insulin dose (TDD), basal and bolus insulin doses, carbohydrate intake, and user-initiated bolus counts were analyzed using linear mixed models. Mediation analysis was used to attribute direct effects of semaglutide versus weight loss on insulin dose reduction. From baseline to week 26, there was a significant 22.6% reduction in TDD (95% CI -28.3 to -17.0), which was driven by greater reductions in bolus insulin (-30.5%; 95% CI -39.5 to -21.5) than basal insulin (-15.6%; 95% CI -21.5 to -9.7). The basal/TDD ratio increased from 0.56 to 0.62 (P < 0.001) and insulin dose (in units/kg/day) decreased from 0.72 to 0.60 (P < 0.001) in the semaglutide group. At week 4, an 83% (-11.1 U/day) reduction in TDD was due to a direct drug effect, and 17% (-2.3 U/day) was attributed to weight loss, whereas at week 26, the difference was split evenly between direct effect (-11.4 U/day; 52%) and weight loss (-10.5 U/day; 48%). Daily carbohydrate intake decreased from 137 g (95% CI 107-167) at baseline to 107 g (95% CI 76-137) at 26 weeks. Semaglutide produced rapid, sustained, and primarily bolus-driven insulin dose reductions, with early effects being largely independent of weight loss in adults with T1D and obesity.",
