This meta-analysis aimed to quantify pooled effect sizes for key biological and clinical outcomes, integrating new findings from the five large trials published in 2025. We systematically searched PubMed, WoS, ClinicalTrials.gov and EU Clinical Trials databases up to June 2025 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating OW insulins in type 2 diabetes. Primary outcomes included efficacy (HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), time-in-range (TIR), time-above-range) and safety outcomes (body weight, hypoglycaemia, time-below-range). Data were analysed using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Among 435 screened records, 16 RCTs were included. OW insulins achieved a greater reduction in HbA1c compared to once-daily insulin or semaglutide (pooled mean difference: -0.12%, 95% CI: -0.19 to -0.04, p = 0.007). TIR was significantly longer in the OW insulin group (+2.41% of total time, 95% CI: 1.13 to 3.69, p = 0.002), while FPG changes were comparable (-3.37 mg/dL, 95% CI: -7.95 to 1.21 mg/dL, p = 0.14). Body weight changes were generally similar, but excluding trials using IcoSema revealed a modest weight gain (+0.33 kg, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.62, p = 0.030). The incidence of clinically significant or severe hypoglycaemia did not differ between groups (pooled incidence rate ratio: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.28, p = 0.75). Meta-regression confirmed consistent effect sizes across OW insulin types, treatment durations and prior insulin regimens. OW insulins modestly improve glycaemic control without increasing hypoglycaemia risk, though slight weight gain may occur.",

      "abstract": "Older patients with diabetes often experience high levels of mental distress, which may complicate diabetes management and negatively impact health outcomes. To evaluate whether an interactive virtual assistant device built with a behavioral intervention model can improve mental health and diabetes-related outcomes in older adults with diabetes. This open randomized clinical trial was conducted at an academic medical center in Brazil between June 22, 2023, and February 8, 2024. Participants aged 65 years or older with type 2 diabetes were included. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive the interactive virtual assistant device (Smart Speaker Echo Dot, 3rd generation [Amazon]) for home use over a 12-week period or to continue with usual care. The device was programmed with a behavioral intervention model aimed at enhancing mental health and diabetes management. The primary outcome was the between-group mean difference (MD) in mental distress, assessed using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire, in which scores range from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating greater mental distress. Secondary outcomes included quality of life (assessed using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey), perceived stress (assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale), adherence to diabetes self-care behaviors (assessed using the Self-Care Inventory Revised questionnaire), and glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c). All outcomes were assessed at the 12-week follow-up. Among 112 participants (mean [SD] age, 72.5 [5.7] years; 71 females [63.4%]), the mean (SD) hemoglobin A1c level was 7.9% (1.5%), and outcome measures were available for 103 participants (52 in the intervention group and 51 in the usual care group). At 12 weeks, the fully adjusted mean (SE) Self-Reporting Questionnaire score was 6.29 (0.44) for participants in the intervention group and 7.75 (0.42) for those in the usual care group, resulting in a fully adjusted MD of -1.46 (95% CI, -2.73 to -0.19; P = .02), suggesting a reduction in mental distress among the intervention group. Subgroup analyses showed consistent improvement favoring the intervention across all subgroups. The intervention was also associated with improvements in quality of life (MD, 9.46 [95% CI, 3.65 to 15.26]; P = .001), adherence to diabetes self-care behaviors (MD, 3.40 [95% CI, 1.61 to 5.19]; P < .001), and glycemic control (MD, -0.48% [95% CI, -0.85 to -0.11]; P = .01). No difference was observed regarding perceived stress (MD, -3.00 [95% CI, -6.20 to 0.20]; P = .07), and no participants withdrew due to adverse events. In this randomized clinical trial of older adults with diabetes, participants in the smart speaker group showed significant improvements in mental distress, quality of life, diabetes self-care, and glycemic control. These findings suggest that this easily implemented self-management intervention could enhance health outcomes in this population. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05329376.",

Current strategies are suboptimal with many patients presenting with advanced HCC. This randomized controlled trial compared the combined use of serum biomarker (BM) measurements and abdominal ultrasound (US) with US alone for the diagnosis of early-stage HCC. Adults with cirrhosis or high-risk hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection were randomized (1:1) to biannual surveillance with US alone (group A) or US and BMs (group B) in blocks of 2 or 4. Positive US results or elevated BMs (α-fetoprotein [AFP] >100 ng/mL, lectin-reactive fraction of AFP [AFP-L3] >10%, des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin [DCP] >2 ng/mL) triggered further imaging for HCC confirmation. Primary end point was proportion of early-stage HCCs. There were 1208 patients randomized (n = 603 group A, n = 605 group B). Mean ± SD age was 58.4 ± 9.8 years, 71.8% were male, 55.1% were Asian, 64.0% had HBV, and 64.3% had cirrhosis. During follow-up, 35 HCCs (5.8%) developed in group A (n = 30 early-stage, n = 5 late-stage) and 27 (4.5%) developed in group B (n = 22 early-stage, n = 5 late-stage). Early-stage HCC incidence was 1.2 per 100 person-years with cumulative probabilities of 1.3% at 52 weeks and 5.9% at 260 weeks.

In group B, elevated AFP-L3 was equally effective compared with using all 3 BMs. Addition of AFP, AFP-L3, and DCP to biannual US did not improve early-stage HCC detection. The trial was not adequately powered to provide evidence that the use of BMs aside from US plus AFP improves HCC surveillance.

A total of 83,288 participants with type 2 diabetes/cardiometabolic diseases from 20 published RCTs were analyzed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). RCTs investigating GLP-1 RAs for type 2 diabetes/cardiometabolic disease populations and reported optic nerve or vision-related adverse events were assessed. Primary outcome was a composite of optic nerve and/or vision-threatening serious adverse events, including ION, ocular ischemic syndrome, papilledema, blindness, blurred vision, visual impairment, and reduced visual acuity. Odds ratios (ORs) were derived. Type 2 diabetes occurred in 76.4% of participants. Over mean follow-up duration of 2.97 years (estimated cumulative exposure of 240,334 patient-years), GLP-1 RA use was not associated with increased risk of primary end point (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73-1.97, I2 = 0%). Prespecified individual adverse events, including ION (OR 1.50, 95% CI 0.49-4.63), and vision loss/disturbance events (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.60-1.94) were not significantly associated with GLP-1 RA use. RCTs reported vision-threatening events as adverse events rather than as prespecified outcomes. Based on a large number of patients who contributed to a meta-analysis of RCTs involving participants with type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic disease, GLP-1 RAs were not associated with an increased risk of optic nerve/vision-threatening events.",

This prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial included patients ≥65 years with elevated stroke risk (CHADS-VASc ≥2 men, ≥3 women) from 2 secondary care centers in the Netherlands.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and characterise the digital technologies and clinical decision support tools used to triage people with diabetes in the inpatient setting.

Three developed or improved systems for referrals to an in-hospital diabetes team. The remaining six reported on efforts to improve information to support referral and included risk prediction for iatrogenic hypoglycaemia, persistent adverse glycaemia and in-hospital mortality among Intensive Care Unit patients with diabetes, and perioperative glycaemic management. Digital technologies and clinical decision support tools can improve inpatient triage of people with diabetes.

Fifty (N=7208 subjects) randomized studies comparing different topical or oral drugs with or without placebo were included in the analysis.

The risk of bias of individual studies was assessed using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials. Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed using an interactive web-based tool with the R packages gemct and BUGSNET. Ranking success probabilities were computed on the basis of the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. Compared with placebo, all the treatments studied were highly efficacious (>75%) for the clinical and mycological cure of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Single-day use of 150 mg of fluconazole was slightly more effective than multiple-day topical therapy in early clinical cure both in pairwise (pooled odds ratio=1.9, 95% confidence interval=1.31-2.74, I2=0%) and network meta-analysis (odds ratio=1.52, 95% confidence interval=1.13-2.07) analyses. In the evaluation of late clinical cure, there were no significant differences in the odds ratios of success between oral and topical treatment, either as single or multiple-day therapy (3983 subjects in the network). Single dose fluconazole was marginally superior to multiple-day topical treatment in late mycological cure (odds ratio=1.42, 95% confidence interval=1-1.99). In the ranking analysis, single-day oral fluconazole treatment had the best chance of achieving early (surface under the cumulative ranking curve=74.1%) and late (surface under the cumulative ranking curve=84.2%) mycological cure. Multiple-day treatment with itraconazole scored best in early (surface under the cumulative ranking curve=99%) and late (surface under the cumulative ranking curve=75.7%) relief of symptoms. Given the high efficacy of both oral and topical drugs, a strict hierarchy of competing treatments for uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis is probably inappropriate; however, current guidelines should acknowledge that oral azoles have a higher chance of clinical success and microbiological eradication of Candida than topical drugs.",

To investigate the effect of physiotherapy techniques (PTs) in relieving endometriosis-associated pain. This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the PRISMA 2020 and Cochrane Handbook guidelines. The study protocol was followed and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023474231). A systematic search was conducted in 3 databases: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. We used the following PICO strategy: population, women with endometriosis-associated pelvic pain; intervention, PTs; comparator, non-PTs; outcome, pelvic pain changes. The article selection was conducted by 2 independent reviewers. Two authors extracted data independently from the eligible articles. For continuous outcomes, the mean difference (MD) in change scores between intervention and control groups was used as an effect size with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Within-group correlation of before- and after-treatment was assumed to be equal across groups and studies. Out of 8 eligible studies identified in our selection, 7 were included in the quantitative analysis. PTs were effective in reducing pain compared to non-PTs (MD -1.97, CI -2.99 to -0.95), and physiotherapy modalities (electrotherapy and laser devices) had the greatest reduction in pain levels (MD -2.03, CI -3.9 to -0.14) among all studies. Additionally, locally applied techniques resulted in greater pain reduction than the generally applied techniques. Physiotherapy techniques are effective in reducing pain in women with endometriosis, especially when applied locally.",

This was a systematic review. Three databases (Medline, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) were searched for studies evaluating interventions aiming to increase access to and uptake of physical health checks for people with SMI. Searches were conducted during October and November 2024 for studies published from 2000 onwards.

Both randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative non-randomised studies were eligible. Primary, secondary, and tertiary care settings were included. Studies from high-income countries were also included. Risk of bias was assessed using version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB2), an adaptation of the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Exposures (ROBINS-E), and Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tools.

Intervention categories were case management ( = 2), financial incentivisation ( = 3), service change ( = 5), invitation ( = 1), and mixed ( = 1). Two RCTs showed a positive effect of a case-management approach; for one study there was 'high' risk of bias. For other interventions, diverse non-randomised studies were included with either positive or mixed findings and risk of bias ranging from 'moderate' to 'critical'.

Mobile interventions offer a potential but largely untested strategy to sustain cessation. To test the effectiveness of mobile chat messaging for relapse prevention among individuals who recently quit smoking. This randomized clinical trial was conducted from March 14, 2023, to August 15, 2024, at 2 clinic-based smoking cessation services in Hong Kong. Participants were adults who smoked daily and had abstained for 3 to 30 days; they were randomly assigned to an intervention group or a control group. All participants received usual smoking cessation treatment from the services. The intervention group additionally received 3 months of mobile relapse prevention intervention, including chat-based support delivered by a live counselor and access to a supportive chatbot via a messaging app. The control group received 8 text messages on generic smoking cessation advice over 3 months as a contact control. The primary outcome was biochemically validated tobacco abstinence at 6 months after randomization, defined by an exhaled carbon monoxide level of less than 5 ppm or a negative salivary cotinine test result. Secondary outcomes at 6 months included self-reported prolonged abstinence, 7-day point prevalence abstinence, and relapse (7 consecutive days of smoking) rate. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted, assuming participants with missing outcomes relapsed. Of 590 participants, 465 (78.8%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 47.1 (11.2) years; 294 were randomized to the intervention group and 296 were randomized to the control group. The retention rate at 6-month follow-up was 98.0% (n = 578).

To determine the 10-year appendicitis recurrence and appendectomy rate in patients with uncomplicated appendicitis treated with antibiotics. Ten-year observational follow-up of patients in the Appendicitis Acuta (APPAC) multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing appendectomy with antibiotics at 6 Finnish hospitals from November 2009 to June 2012, where 530 patients (aged 18-60 years) with uncomplicated acute appendicitis diagnosed by computed tomography were randomly assigned to appendectomy (n = 273) or antibiotics (n = 257). Last follow-up was April 29, 2024. This current analysis focused on assessing the 10-year appendicitis recurrence rate among patients assigned to antibiotics. Open appendectomy vs antibiotics with intravenous ertapenem sodium (1 g/d) for 3 days followed by 7 days of oral levofloxacin (500 mg once daily) and metronidazole (500 mg 3 times/d). Prespecified 10-year secondary end points included late (after 1 year) appendectomy and appendicitis recurrence rate after antibiotics and complications. Post hoc outcomes included the detection of possible appendiceal tumors among patients in the antibiotic group undergoing appendectomy or with an intact appendix using magnetic resonance imaging. Additional post hoc outcomes were quality of life and patient satisfaction. At 10-year follow-up, 253/257 patients (98.4%) randomized to receive antibiotics (median age, 33 years; 102 [40.3%] female) were assessed for appendicitis recurrence, with a true appendicitis recurrence rate (appendicitis at histopathology) of 37.8% (95% CI, 31.6%-44.1% [87/230]) and a cumulative appendectomy rate of 44.3% (95% CI, 38.2%-50.4% [112/253]). Overall, the 10-year cumulative complication rate in the group randomized to appendectomy was 27.4% (95% CI, 21.6%-33.3% [62/226]) and 8.5% (95% CI, 4.8%-12.1% [19/224]) in the group randomized to receive antibiotics (P < .001). There was no observed significant difference in quality of life between antibiotics and appendectomy (387/530; median health index value, 1.0 [95% CI, 1.0-1.0] for both groups; P = .18). Among patients initially treated with antibiotics for uncomplicated acute appendicitis, the rate of recurrence and appendectomy at 10-year follow-up supports the use of antibiotics as an option for uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adult patients.

      "abstract": "Many therapies exist for the treatment of chronic low back pain (LBP), including spinal manipulative therapy (SMT), which is a worldwide, extensively practised intervention. The effectiveness of SMT for chronic LBP is not without dispute. This Cochrane review is an update of a Cochrane systematic review published in 2011. To evaluate the benefits and harms of SMT compared to (1) sham SMT/placebo intervention, (2) no treatment, and (3) other conservative interventions in people with chronic LBP (18+ years old). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trial registers up to 18 October 2024, unrestricted by language. We also screened the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews, and approached content experts to identify potentially missing studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effect of spinal manipulation or mobilisation in adults with chronic LBP compared to sham SMT/placebo, no treatment, and other conservative interventions. We placed no restrictions on the setting. We excluded studies that exclusively examined sciatica. Our critical outcomes were pain, functional status, and adverse events. The primary time point was one month for pain and functional status. We evaluated adverse events at the end of the intervention. We assessed bias in the included studies using the original Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 1). Where possible, we synthesised results using meta-analysis with a generic inverse-variance approach and random-effects models; otherwise, we used narrative synthesis. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Our main comparisons were SMT versus (1) sham SMT/placebo treatment, (2) no treatment, and (3) other conservative interventions at one month. We converted all pain scales to a 100-point scale. Seventy-six RCTs (11,866 participants) met our inclusion criteria, 50 (66%) of which were not included in the previous version of this review. Seventeen trials (2021 participants) compared SMT to sham SMT/placebo, and four trials (435 participants) compared SMT to no treatment. Most trials (43, including 8291 participants) examined the effect of SMT compared to other conservative interventions. The remaining trials examined other comparisons. Treatment allocation was appropriately conducted in just four sham SMT/placebo-controlled trials (24%), while only six trials 'blinded' participants to the intervention (35%), indicating a high risk of selection and performance bias. Similarly, the no-treatment controlled trials were as susceptible to selection bias (50%) and performance bias (75%). All trials were conducted in high-income (n = 53) or middle-income (n = 23) countries. In most studies, the population was middle-aged and included men and women. SMT versus sham SMT/placebo We found very low-certainty evidence (downgraded for inconsistency and study limitations) that SMT may result in a small reduction in pain compared to sham SMT/placebo at one month (mean difference (MD) -7.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) -12.48 to -1.53; I = 94%; 16 studies, 1570 participants) and very low-certainty evidence (downgraded for study limitations and inconsistency) that SMT may result in a medium improvement in functional status compared to sham SMT/placebo at one month (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.41, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.13; I = 82%; 13 studies, 1416 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain. SMT versus no treatment We found very low-certainty evidence (downgraded for study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision) that SMT may result in a medium reduction in pain compared to no treatment at one month (MD -13.99, 95% CI -27.33 to -0.66; I = 89%; 4 studies, 325 participants), but the evidence is very uncertain. We found low-certainty evidence (downgraded for study limitations and imprecision) that SMT may result in a large improvement in functional status compared to no treatment at one month (SMD -0.84, 95% CI -1.32 to -0.35; I = 71%; 4 studies, 312 participants). SMT versus other conservative interventions Low-certainty evidence (downgraded for inconsistency) indicated that SMT may result in little to no difference in pain (MD -4.72, 95% CI -8.26 to -1.17; I = 89%; 31 studies, 4109 participants) and may result in a small improvement in functional status (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.11; I = 73%; 28 studies, 3940 participants) compared to other conservative interventions at one month. These effects, however, should be interpreted with caution due to the substantial statistical heterogeneity for which there is no clear explanation. Less than half of the studies (47%) reported on adverse events, of which 12 studies reported these systematically. Adverse events in the SMT group were limited to muscle soreness, stiffness, and/or transient increase in pain. None of the studies registered any serious complications related to either the experimental or control group treatment. The evidence is very uncertain about the adverse effects of SMT. When SMT is compared to sham SMT/placebo, it may result in a small improvement in pain and medium improvement in functional status in adults with chronic low back pain. When compared to no treatment, SMT may result in a medium improvement in pain and a large improvement in functional status. When compared to other conservative interventions, SMT may result in little to no difference in pain and a small improvement in functional status. The evidence is of low to very low certainty, largely due to the fact that the effects of SMT were examined in trials conducted in different settings and populations, with different types of SMT technique, dosage, and frequency of treatment. Continuing to conduct RCTs in the same manner will neither strengthen the evidence nor our confidence in it.

      "abstract": "Prior studies, largely among middle-aged adults, reported aspirin reduces cancer risk after 10 years, particularly for colorectal cancer (CRC). In contrast, the Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) randomized clinical trial (RCT) reported that low-dose aspirin (LDA) treatment for a median of 4.7 years had no effect on overall cancer incidence but increased risk of incident late-stage cancer and cancer-related mortality. To assess whether LDA is associated with cancer incidence and mortality in 10 years of follow-up in older adults (aged ≥70 years) and to assess the association with cancer after prior LDA exposure (legacy effects). This community-based binational (Australian and US) cohort study included community-dwelling older adults (aged ≥70 years for Australian participants and ≥65 years for US minority group participants) free from overt cardiovascular disease, dementia, or independence-limiting physical disability. The cohort was derived from the ASPREE randomized clinical trial conducted from 2010 to 2017, with the observational extension study (ASPREE-XT) following up participants from 2018 to 2024. This study reports data from 2010 through 2022 (long-term outcomes) as well as reports analyses confined to the observation phase only (legacy analyses). Data were analyzed from May to November 2025. Daily 100-mg aspirin or placebo from randomization until cessation of study drug. Outcomes were physician-adjudicated incident cancer, type, stage at diagnosis, and cancer mortality. In 19 114 community-dwelling older adults (mean [SD] age, 75.1 [4.5] years; 56.4% female), a total of 3448 incident cancers and 1173 cancer-related deaths occurred over 10 years of follow-up (median, 8.6 [IQR, 7.4-10.0] years) during ASPREE and ASPREE-XT. LDA was not associated with overall cancer incidence over the long term (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92-1.05), by stage at diagnosis or cancer type, including colorectal cancer (HR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.84-1.21). However, LDA was associated with increased cancer-related mortality (HR = 1.15; 95% CI, 1.03-1.29). Among 14 907 participants without cancer during the RCT and consented into ASPREE-XT (median age, 78.6 years [IQR, 76.2-82.1]; 57.5% female), 1451 incident cancers and 376 cancer deaths occurred in the post-RCT period, during which original aspirin assignment during the RCT was not associated with differences in cancer incidence (HR = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.82-1.01) or cancer-related mortality (HR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.83-1.25) compared with original placebo assignment. In this study, over a median of 8.6 years, LDA was not associated with incident cancer among older adults, but cancer mortality risk was significantly elevated. However, the elevated cancer mortality risk seen with aspirin for participants in the RCT period did not persist into the post-RCT observation period, suggesting no legacy effect.",

      "abstract": "Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are increasingly used for superficial vein thrombosis (SVT), yet evidence remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes all available data on the efficacy and safety of DOACs in SVT.A systematic search identified randomized and observational studies enrolling adults with acute SVT treated with DOACs. Primary efficacy outcomes were venous thromboembolism (VTE: deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) and SVT recurrence/extension. Safety outcomes included major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB).Six studies ( = 2,040; 602 DOAC-treated patients) met the inclusion criteria. Compared with fondaparinux, DOACs showed comparable short-term efficacy for VTE prevention (pooled risk ratio [RR] 0.93, 95% CI 0.44-1.99) and similar rates of SVT recurrence (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.65-2.62). Versus placebo, rivaroxaban reduced recurrence by approximately 80% (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.03-1.35). In the pooled safety analysis including four studies, DOACs were associated with a 65% relative risk reduction in major or CRNMB compared with fondaparinux or low-molecular-weight heparin (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15-0.83;   = 0%). In the TROLL registry ( = 229; 74% DOAC), no major bleeding occurred among DOAC users, while 5-year cumulative VTE and SVT recurrence rates were each 15.9%. Certainty of evidence was moderate for efficacy and high for safety.DOACs demonstrate efficacy comparable to fondaparinux and an excellent safety profile in SVT, supporting their use as a practical oral alternative. Long-term data indicate persistent thrombotic risk, suggesting potential benefit of extended low-dose prophylaxis in selected high-risk patients.",

Eligible participants were randomised (1:1) to receive a natural ovulation regimen or a programmed regimen of hormone replacement for endometrial preparation. Endometrial preparation and frozen embryo transfer timing were determined in the natural ovulation regimen group by monitoring natural follicle development and measuring serum levels of luteinising hormone, oestradiol, and progesterone. In the programmed regimen group, endometrial preparation was achieved by sequential administration of oestrogen and progesterone.

In the intention-to-treat analyses, 910 (41.6%) of 2185 patients in the natural ovulation regimen group and 890 (40.6%) of 2191 in the programmed regimen group achieved a healthy live birth (relative ratio 1.03 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.10); P=0.49).

To determine the efficacy of 6 weeks of intranasal steroid (INS) compared with saline in children with obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (OSDB) with persistent symptoms after a 6-week intranasal saline run-in. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial involving specialist clinic waitlists at 2 sites in Australia. Included were children aged 3 to 12 years. Study data were analyzed from January to June 2025. All children received once-daily intranasal saline for 6 weeks (run-in). Those with persisting symptoms (SDB score ≥-1) were randomized to either once-daily intranasal mometasone furoate, 50 µg, (INS) or continued saline for a further 6 weeks. The primary outcome was symptom resolution (SDB score <-1). Secondary outcomes included behavior, quality of life, and parental perception of need for surgery. Analyses were adjusted for site and baseline measures. A total of 150 children (mean [SD] age, 6.2 [2.3] years; 93 male [62%]) were recruited. Of 139 children who completed the run-in phase, 41 (29.5%) had symptom resolution after saline run-in. Among 93 children randomized to intervention groups (47 INS; 46 saline), symptom resolution occurred in 35.6% (95% CI, 22.9%-50.6%) and 36.4% (95% CI, 23.5%-51.6%) of the INS and saline group, respectively, with no evidence for a clinically significant difference between groups (risk difference, -0.9%; 95% CI, -20.7% to 19.0%; P = .93). No group differences were found in secondary outcomes. Subgroup analysis did not reveal a group more or less likely to respond to medical treatment. Results of this randomized clinical trial show that 6 weeks of intranasal saline resolved OSDB symptoms in nearly one-third of children. An additional 6-week course of INS or saline led to resolution in another one-third (total resolution around 50%), with no added benefit from INS. Intranasal saline is an effective short-term first-line treatment for OSDB before consideration of polysomnography or surgical intervention.

      "abstract": "WHO recommends fractional dose vaccination to address yellow fever vaccine shortages during outbreaks. In adults, a 500 IU dose has recently been shown to be non-inferior to the full standard dose, but the minimum effective dose for children is unknown. We conducted a randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial at two centres in Kenya and Uganda, including infants aged 9-12 months with no previous yellow fever vaccination or infection. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 in blocks of variable sizes of four, six, or eight to receive either the standard dose (>13 000 IU) or 500 IU of the Institut Pasteur de Dakar (Dakar, Senegal) 17D-204 yellow fever vaccine, co-administered with the measles-rubella vaccine. The primary outcome was seroconversion 28 days post-vaccination, defined as a four-fold or greater increase in antibody titre at day 28 from baseline (day 0), as measured by the 50% plaque reduction neutralisation test. Non-inferiority was shown if the lower bound of the 95% CI for the difference in seroconversion rates between doses exceeded -10 percentage points. Safety was assessed in the safety population, which included all participants who received a study vaccine dose. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04059471) and is complete. Between Oct 7, 2021, and June 14, 2023, 420 infants were enrolled and randomly assigned (210 participants in each group). The seroconversion rate at day 28 was 99% (95% CI 96-100; 177 of 179 infants) for the standard dose and 93% (88-96; 166 of 179 infants) for the 500 IU dose in the per-protocol population. The difference in seroconversion rate was -6·15 percentage points (95% CI -10·27 to -2·02); therefore, non-inferiority was not met for the 500 IU dose. 12 serious adverse events were reported in the study (eight in the 500 IU dose group and four in the standard dose group), but all were considered unrelated to vaccination. Compared with the standard yellow fever vaccine dose, a dose of 500 IU did not meet the non-inferiority criterion, suggesting that minimum dose requirements in adults are not generalisable to infants. Therefore, standard yellow fever doses should be used for infants in the routine WHO Expanded Programme on Immunization.

      "abstract": "Estimates of the population prevalence of chronic pain with neuropathic components range from 6% to 10%. Current pharmacological treatments for neuropathic pain help only a minority. New treatments are needed. Cannabis is increasingly promoted in the media as a treatment for chronic pain. This is an update of a review first published in 2018. To assess the benefits and harms of cannabis-based medicines (herbal, plant-based, synthetic) compared to placebo or conventional drugs for chronic neuropathic pain conditions in adults. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and three trial registries, together with reference checking. The latest search date was 29 January 2025. We selected randomised, double-blind controlled trials of medical cannabis, plant-derived and synthetic cannabinoids, against placebo or any other active treatment for chronic neuropathic pain conditions in adults, with a treatment duration of at least two weeks. We excluded studies whose double-blind duration was less than two weeks and studies which did not explicitly state that the pain was of a neuropathic nature. Critical outcomes were the number of participants reporting pain relief of at least 50%, a Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) rating of 'much' or 'very much' improved, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events. We assessed the risk of bias (RoB) for seven outcomes reported in three summary of findings tables using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. We synthesised results for each outcome using meta-analysis with a random-effects model by calculating absolute risk differences (RD) and standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and continuous outcomes, respectively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for prespecified outcomes. We included six new studies involving 450 participants, along with 15 studies involving 1737 participants from the 2018 review, for a total of 21 studies with 2187 participants. The studies ranged from two to 26 weeks in duration. Sample sizes ranged from 18 to 339 participants. Participants' mean age ranged from 34 to 61 years, and the proportion of women ranged from 0% to 90%. Five studies included participants with central neuropathic pain, 14 studies included participants with peripheral neuropathic pain, and two studies included both types. Seven studies administered tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-dominant medicines; nine studies, balanced THC and cannabidiol (CBD) medicines; and five studies, CBD-dominant medicines. Twenty studies compared cannabis-based medicine to placebo, and one study's comparator was dihydrocodeine. We judged the overall risk of bias to be low in six studies, unclear in 10 studies, and high in five studies. THC-dominant medicines versus placebo. There is no clear evidence for an effect on pain relief of at least 50% (RD 0.14, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.37; 7 studies, 534 participants), PGIC rating of 'much' or 'very much' improved (RD 0.17, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.58; 2 studies, 72 participants), withdrawals due to adverse events (RD 0.03, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.08; 6 studies, 511 participants), serious adverse events (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.06; 7 studies, 537 participants), pain relief of at least 30% (RD 0.16, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.40; 7 studies, 566 participants), and psychiatric disorder-related adverse events (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03; 4 studies, 368 participants), all with very low-certainty evidence.

      "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis is characterised by inflammation and swelling of the brain, resulting in death or severe neurocognitive sequelae. HSV encephalitis is treated with the antiviral aciclovir but still has substantial mortality and morbidity. Adjunct corticosteroids are sometimes used, but whether they improve the outcome is unclear. We aimed to establish the safety and efficacy of adjunct corticosteroids in HSV encephalitis. In this multicentre, observer-blind, randomised, phase 3 trial, adults with HSV encephalitis admitted to 53 hospitals in the UK were randomly assigned to receive intravenous dexamethasone (10 mg/kg, four times daily for 4 days) plus intravenous aciclovir (10 mg/kg three times daily for at least 14 days; dexamethasone group), or intravenous aciclovir alone (control group). Eligible patients aged 16 years or older had suspected encephalitis (a febrile illness with new onset seizure, new focal neurological signs or alteration in consciousness, cognition, personality, or behaviour), with positive HSV type 1 or type 2 PCR test in CSF. Participants were randomly assigned by the trial team at the recruiting site, using a secure web-based randomisation programme. The primary outcome was verbal memory score at 26 weeks, measured by the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS)-IV auditory memory index. Analyses of primary and secondary outcomes were performed according to the modified intention-to-treat principle, and safety analyses were based on whether participants received at least one dose of the study drug. Trial neuropsychologists assessing the primary outcome, and statisticians involved in the study's primary outcome, were masked to treatment group allocation. The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Registry, ISRCTN11774734, and EudraCT, EudraCT2016-004835-19, and is completed. Between Sept 22, 2016, and Feb 2, 2022, 94 patients with HSV encephalitis were recruited, 47 (20 [43%] female and 27 [57%] male) to the dexamethasone group, and 47 (24 [51%] female and 23 [49%] male) to the control group. Dexamethasone was initiated a median 7 (IQR 4-8) days after hospital admission. Seven patients withdrew consent, and six were lost to follow-up. Thus, 81 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (39 in the treatment group and 42 in the control group). The primary outcome, verbal memory score at 26 weeks, did not differ significantly between the groups (71 [SD 26] in the dexamethasone group, and 69 [SD 25] in the control group; adjusted difference 1·77 [95% CI -9·57 to 13·12; p=0·76). There were 27 adverse events involving 18 (38%) participants in the control group, and 25 adverse events involving 18 (40%) participants in the dexamethasone group. The most common serious adverse events were seizures requiring readmission to hospital (affecting one [2%] patient in the dexamethasone group and one [2%] patient in the control group) and thrombotic events, including deep vein thrombosis (affecting one [2%] patient in the dexamethasone group) and pulmonary embolism (affecting one [2%]patient in the dexamethasone group). There were no treatment-related deaths. In adults with HSV encephalitis, dexamethasone plus aciclovir had a satisfactory safety profile but did not improve verbal memory score compared with aciclovir alone. Given the established role of corticosteroids in other inflammatory encephalitides, our findings suggest that their early use in suspected encephalitis is unlikely to be harmful. Future studies should assess more targeted immunomodulatory approaches in HSV encephalitis. National Institute for Health and Care Research.",

Trial neuropsychologists assessing the primary outcome, and statisticians involved in the study's primary outcome, were masked to treatment group allocation. The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Registry, ISRCTN11774734, and EudraCT, EudraCT2016-004835-19, and is completed."

Dexamethasone was initiated a median 7 (IQR 4-8) days after hospital admission. Seven patients withdrew consent, and six were lost to follow-up. Thus, 81 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (39 in the treatment group and 42 in the control group). The primary outcome, verbal memory score at 26 weeks, did not differ significantly between the groups (71 [SD 26] in the dexamethasone group, and 69 [SD 25] in the control group; adjusted difference 1·77 [95% CI -9·57 to 13·12; p=0·76). There were 27 adverse events involving 18 (38%) participants in the control group, and 25 adverse events involving 18 (40%) participants in the dexamethasone group. The most common serious adverse events were seizures requiring readmission to hospital (affecting one [2%] patient in the dexamethasone group and one [2%] patient in the control group) and thrombotic events, including deep vein thrombosis (affecting one [2%] patient in the dexamethasone group) and pulmonary embolism (affecting one [2%]patient in the dexamethasone group). There were no treatment-related deaths."

          "text": "In adults with HSV encephalitis, dexamethasone plus aciclovir had a satisfactory safety profile but did not improve verbal memory score compared with aciclovir alone. Given the established role of corticosteroids in other inflammatory encephalitides, our findings suggest that their early use in suspected encephalitis is unlikely to be harmful. Future studies should assess more targeted immunomodulatory approaches in HSV encephalitis."

Quantitative evidence on how this concomitant therapy contributes to treatment outcomes is limited, highlighting the need for a systematic synthesis. To evaluate whether the quantity of psychological therapy is associated with symptom reduction in PAT for depressive symptoms. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases were searched from inception to June 16, 2025. The analysis included controlled clinical trials involving adults with depressive symptoms who received PAT using classic serotonergic psychedelics (eg, psilocybin or lysergic acid diethylamide). Within these trials, psychedelic dosing sessions were embedded in therapeutic sessions before (preparation) and after (integration). Studies were excluded if they used microdosing as the primary intervention, involved naturalistic or purely pharmacological administration, or did not report therapy session count or duration. Qualitative studies, reviews, case reports, and conference abstracts were also excluded. Of the 226 records identified, 42 full texts were assessed by 2 independent reviewers, of which 12 met inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Multilevel random-effects meta-analysis and multilevel metaregressions were conducted using robust variance estimation. The primary outcomes were standardized mean differences (Hedges g) in depressive symptoms at all available posttreatment time points. Metaregression analyses assessed associations of different metrics of psychological therapy quantity (duration in hours, number of sessions, and total duration in weeks) with treatment outcomes. The 12 included trials had a total sample of 733 participants (365 female [49.8%]; mean [SD] age, 43.1 [6.2] years). PAT showed a large overall effect size in reducing depressive symptoms compared with control conditions (Hedges g = -0.84; 95% CI, -1.15 to -0.54; P < .001). More preparation therapy hours were significantly associated with greater symptom reduction (β = -0.13; 95% CI, -0.24 to -0.01; P = .04). No significant associations were found for hours of postdosing integration (β = -0.02; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.05; P = .53) or total session count (β = -0.01; 95% CI, -0.09 to -0.08; P = .86). Longer follow-up periods, measured in weeks from substance administration, were generally associated with smaller treatment effect sizes (β = 0.02; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.04; P = .003). Risk of bias was high in the majority (9 [75%]) of studies, mostly due to ineffective blinding. In this systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials investigating PAT for depressive symptoms, a greater quantity of preparation therapy was associated with significantly larger reductions of depressive symptoms. These findings highlight a potential key role of preparation in optimizing PAT outcomes. The observed association primarily reflects quantitative aspects of therapy exposure rather than qualitative or process-related dimensions of the therapeutic interaction. Additional systematic research is needed to clarify this association and optimize all therapeutic components within psychedelic interventions.",

      "abstract": "ObjectiveThis study aims to determine the optimal exercise types and dosages for improving cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia.Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus databases were searched from inception to August 26, 2025.Review methodsTwo reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A dose-response network meta-analytic model was applied to explore how exercise dosage within different exercise modalities influences cognitive outcomes in older adults with varying degrees of cognitive impairment.ResultsOur search identified 10,721 records, from which 68 studies comprising 6544 participants were included in the final analysis. A nonlinear dose-response relationship between physical activity and cognitive function was observed. A minimum threshold of 336 Metabolic Equivalent of Task minutes per week was required to yield cognitive benefits, while 934 Metabolic Equivalent of Task minutes per week was the minimum dose for clinically meaningful improvements. However, substantial variability was observed, particularly between individuals with mild cognitive impairment and those with dementia. The dose-response relationship varied by exercise modalities, with some modalities showing significant effects at lower doses. Aerobic exercise combined with resistance training exhibited superior efficacy compared to other modalities.ConclusionFor older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia, combining aerobic exercise with resistance training is most effective for boosting cognitive function, even with modest activity levels. It is important to choose specific exercise modalities and adjust their amounts to maximize cognitive gains in rehabilitation programs.",

Early developmental interventions have shown potential benefits, but their long-term effect on executive functioning remains uncertain. To evaluate whether an enhanced developmental intervention (EDI) initiated in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and continued at home through the first 2 years improves executive function at school age in very preterm children. This secondary analysis assessed school-aged outcomes from a randomized clinical trial of infants born with fewer than 32 weeks of gestation or with birth weight less than 1500 g from January 2016 to February 2019. Follow-up assessments were conducted from July 7, 2023, to August 16, 2024, at a single center in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Data analyses were completed from August to December 2024. EDI compared with usual care. The primary outcomes were the scaled scores of Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment, Second Edition, subtests, which measures auditory attention, inhibition, design fluency, and motor persistence. The examiner was masked to group allocation. Medical records identified children with neurodevelopmental conditions that precluded formal assessment. The effect size for the Mann-Whitney U test comparisons was calculated using the rank-biserial correlation. Binary logistic regression was used to compare performance in the primary outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were used for those lost to follow-up. Of the original randomized clinical trial, 80 children (96% of those eligible) were assessed at a mean (SD) age of 7 (1) years; 34 children (43%) were female. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. In the primary analysis of median scaled scores, children who received EDI demonstrated significantly better performance across all 4 executive function domains compared to usual care (median scores, 12-14 vs 2-9; r = 0.44-0.77; all P < .001). All results remained significant after Bonferroni correction (P < .0125), indicating medium to large effect sizes. In the secondary analysis of performance classification, EDI was associated with higher odds of expected performance in design fluency (odds ratio, 11.3; 95% CI, 4.08-31.7; P < .001). No statistically significant differences were observed for the remaining 3 domains. In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, early EDI, beginning in the NICU and extending through the first 2 years, contributed to sustained improvements in executive function in very preterm children. These findings support the long-term neurodevelopmental benefits of early intervention, with potential implications for academic and socioemotional outcomes in children from low- and middle-income settings.
