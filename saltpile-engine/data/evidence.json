      "abstract": "Accurate assessment of intravascular volume facilitates management decisions about fluid management in patients with volume overload. To identify the most accurate clinical examination, radiographic, and laboratory findings for assessing volume overload in nonintubated patients. MEDLINE was searched (1946 to January 6, 2026) to identify peer-reviewed English-language studies about the diagnostic accuracy of the clinical examination of spontaneously breathing patients with intravascular volume overload. Three authors independently extracted data for each finding and calculated sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs). A 2-level mixed logistic regression model was used to pool estimates. Forty studies, involving 11 490 adult patients, were included, with a prevalence of volume overload of 35% to 69%. Thirty-three of those studies evaluated patients with dyspnea. Prevalence of volume overload was more likely when the physical examination revealed jugular venous distention with the highest point of pulsation more than 3 cm in a vertical line above the sternal angle (LR, 4.1 [95% CI, 2.9-5.6]; specificity, 92%), lower extremity edema (LR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.5-3.1]; specificity, 80%), or crackles on auscultation (LR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.7-4.5]; specificity, 81%). Vascular congestion on chest radiography increased the likelihood of intravascular volume overload (LR, 5.9 [95% CI, 2.9-12.0]; specificity, 91%). Point-of-care ultrasonography that identified bilateral pulmonary B-lines suggested volume overload (LR, 4.0 [95% CI, 2.6-6.1]; specificity, 77%), and absence of pulmonary B-lines made volume overload unlikely (LR, 0.09 [95% CI, 0.04-0.23]; sensitivity, 93%). Inferior vena cava collapsibility index of less than 50% increased the likelihood of volume overload (LR, 3.9 [95% CI, 2.5-6.1]; specificity, 79%), and a collapsibility index of at least 50% made it less likely (LR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.11-0.45]; sensitivity, 82%). Point-of-care ultrasonographic measurement of jugular venous pressure (JVP; >8 cm) also increased the likelihood of volume overload (LR, 2.8 [95% CI, 2.2-3.5]; specificity, 71%), although JVP of 8 cm or less identified patients less likely to have volume overload (LR, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.20-0.33]; sensitivity, 81%). A plasma brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 100 ng/mL or higher was the single best test to identify those most likely to have volume overload (LR, 6.9 [95% CI, 2.4-20.4]; specificity, 87%), and a normal value made it less likely (LR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.08-0.24]; sensitivity, 87%). A BNP level of 100 ng/mL or higher and presence of vascular congestion on chest radiography may be the most useful tests to identify patients with volume overload. Absence of pulmonary B-lines using point-of-care ultrasonography or BNP levels of less than 100 ng/mL may be most useful to exclude volume overload.",

      "abstract": "An acute scrotum is an urological emergency. One of its most important causes is testicular torsion, which can result in testicular necrosis unless quickly diagnosed and treated. Along with point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), the Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion (TWIST) score can be used to differentiate between testicular torsion and other causes of an acute scrotum. However, their diagnostic performance when undertaken by emergency physicians (EPs) and paediatricians in the emergency department (ED), as opposed to urologists/radiologists, is uncertain. This retrospective observational study investigated patients aged ≤15 years with an acute scrotum who visited a paediatric tertiary care hospital's ED between March 2018 and August 2022. The diagnostic accuracy of the TWIST score and POCUS when performed by EPs and paediatricians to diagnose testicular torsion was calculated. Each TWIST score served as a cut-off. For practical purposes, a cutoff ≥3 points was used for sensitivity and the negative predictive value (NPV), and a cutoff ≥5 points was used for specificity and the positive predictive value (PPV). The final diagnosis served as the reference standard. Of 512 patients, 55 (11%) had testicular torsion. The TWIST score had 91% sensitivity (95% CI 80%-97%), 95% specificity (95% CI 93% to 97%), 63% PPV (95% CI 50% to 75%) and 99% NPV (95% CI 97% to 100%). When positivity was defined as either impaired testicular blood flow or the whirlpool sign, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 96% (95% CI 87% to 100%), 95% (95% CI 93% to 97%), 70% (95% CI 58% to 80%) and 100% (95% CI 98% to 100%) respectively. Although the TWIST score and POCUS had high diagnostic accuracy for paediatric testicular torsion when performed by EPs or paediatricians in the ED, the non-negligible, false-negative rate indicated that the TWIST score should be used for risk stratification rather than as an exclusionary method.",

Two multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3 studies (KALOS and LOGOS) recruited participants aged 12-80 years with inadequately-controlled asthma despite daily medium-dose or high-dose ICS-LABA use from across 378 sites in 20 countries (KALOS), and 324 sites in 15 countries (LOGOS). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to BGF 320 μg, 28·8 μg, 10 μg (BGF 28·8); BGF 320 μg, 14·4 μg, 10 μg (BGF 14·4); BFF 320 μg, 10 μg; or BFF 320 μg, 9 μg, twice a day via pressurised metered-dose inhaler for 24-52 weeks. Primary lung function endpoints were change from baseline in FEV area under the curve from 0 h to 3 h (AUC) and in morning pre-dose trough FEV from day 1 to week 24 (over 24 weeks; depending on regional health authority guidance). The primary pooled analysis across both studies was annualised severe exacerbations. The efficacy analysis set and safety set included all randomly assigned participants receiving any amount of study treatment but were analysed according to randomly assigned treatment and received treatment, respectively. The KALOS and LOGOS studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04609878 and NCT04609904, respectively) and are complete. Between Dec 15, 2020, and March 21, 2025 (KALOS), and between March 1, 2021, and March 20, 2025 (LOGOS), 8820 participants were recruited and 4311 received treatment (1179 received BGF 28·8, 726 received BGF 14·4, 1210 received BFF, and 1196 received BFF). In each study, the pre-specified multiplicity-adjusted primary endpoints for all regulatory comparisons were met. Least squares mean differences favoured BGF 28·8 for change from baseline in trough FEV and FEV AUC across all comparisons (all p<0·05). Least squares mean differences in change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV and in FEV AUC over 24 weeks for BGF 28·8 versus BFF were 76 mL (95% CI 57-94; p<0·0001) and 90 mL (72-108; p<0·0001), respectively. BGF 28·8 reduced severe exacerbation rates versus BFF (incidence rate ratio 0·86, 95% CI 0·76-0·97; p=0·012) and versus BFF (0·82, 0·71-0·94; p=0·0043). Exacerbation rate ratio for BGF 28·8 versus BFF was 0·90 (95% CI 0·78-1·03; p=0·12). 627 (53·2%) adverse events were observed with BGF 28·8, 436 (60·0%) with BGF 14·4, 666 (55·2%) with BFF, and 698 (58·4%) with BFF. No deaths were treatment related. These findings show that BGF improves lung function and reduces severe exacerbation rates in a broad population with asthma inadequately controlled despite medium-dose or high-dose ICS-LABA use. Given that these findings were observed regardless of recent exacerbation history, BGF could benefit individuals with inadequately controlled asthma without requiring a recent episode of acute deterioration on ICS-LABA before escalation.

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to BGF 320 μg, 28·8 μg, 10 μg (BGF 28·8); BGF 320 μg, 14·4 μg, 10 μg (BGF 14·4); BFF 320 μg, 10 μg; or BFF 320 μg, 9 μg, twice a day via pressurised metered-dose inhaler for 24-52 weeks. Primary lung function endpoints were change from baseline in FEV area under the curve from 0 h to 3 h (AUC) and in morning pre-dose trough FEV from day 1 to week 24 (over 24 weeks; depending on regional health authority guidance). The primary pooled analysis across both studies was annualised severe exacerbations. The efficacy analysis set and safety set included all randomly assigned participants receiving any amount of study treatment but were analysed according to randomly assigned treatment and received treatment, respectively. The KALOS and LOGOS studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04609878 and NCT04609904, respectively) and are complete."

In each study, the pre-specified multiplicity-adjusted primary endpoints for all regulatory comparisons were met. Least squares mean differences favoured BGF 28·8 for change from baseline in trough FEV and FEV AUC across all comparisons (all p<0·05). Least squares mean differences in change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV and in FEV AUC over 24 weeks for BGF 28·8 versus BFF were 76 mL (95% CI 57-94; p<0·0001) and 90 mL (72-108; p<0·0001), respectively. BGF 28·8 reduced severe exacerbation rates versus BFF (incidence rate ratio 0·86, 95% CI 0·76-0·97; p=0·012) and versus BFF (0·82, 0·71-0·94; p=0·0043). Exacerbation rate ratio for BGF 28·8 versus BFF was 0·90 (95% CI 0·78-1·03; p=0·12). 627 (53·2%) adverse events were observed with BGF 28·8, 436 (60·0%) with BGF 14·4, 666 (55·2%) with BFF, and 698 (58·4%) with BFF.

      "abstract": "Induction of labour (IoL) aims to initiate labour when the risks of continuing pregnancy outweigh the benefits. Over 10 methods are currently available, yet the most effective and safest method remains unclear. To compare the benefits and harms of various cervical ripening and IoL methods at or beyond term labour and to rank the methods. We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO ICTRP until 1 February 2023. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating IoL methods among women with a live fetus at or beyond term labour (gestational age ≥ 37 weeks). We focused on the methods currently recommended by international guidelines and those proposed by previous Cochrane reviews. Our critical outcomes included failure to achieve vaginal delivery within 24 hours, caesarean section due to any causes, caesarean section due to non-reassuring fetal status, uterine hyperstimulation with changes in the heartbeat of the baby before birth, perinatal death, and severe neonatal morbidity. We assessed bias and trustworthiness using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool and the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Trustworthiness Tool (CPS-TST), respectively. The final analyses only included trials that met the CPS-TST. We performed pair-wise meta-analyses using a random-effects model and network meta-analyses (NMA) with a frequentist approach. We reported analyses and results separately for two populations: 1) women without a previous caesarean section and a mix of women with or without a previous caesarean section (where more than 50% of participants had no previous caesarean section), and 2) women with a previous caesarean section. We used risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) to present treatment effects with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence for critical outcomes using the GRADE approach for NMA. We used the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to estimate treatment ranking. The analysis included 106 RCTs assessing 13 IoL methods among 30,348 women. Most trials (84.9%) were conducted in inpatient settings. Only two RCTs recruited women with previous caesarean section, and seven RCTs recruited a mix of women with or without a previous caesarean section. We evaluated the effects of the following IoL methods: vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg), oral misoprostol (≤ 50 μg), sublingual or buccal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg), controlled-release misoprostol vaginal pessary, vaginal dinoprostone (tablet or gel), controlled-release dinoprostone vaginal pessary, oxytocin (alone), nitric oxide donors, balloon catheters, osmotic cervical dilators, oxytocin plus amniotomy (Oxytocin+Amniotomy), balloon catheters plus oxytocin (Balloon+Oxytocin), balloon catheters plus vaginal/oral misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) (Balloon+Misoprostol ≤ 50 μg), and inactive methods (placebo, no intervention, and expectant management). The following results show the relative effects of NMA for four of the six critical outcomes among women without previous caesarean section and a mix of women with or without previous caesarean section. The findings of women with previous caesarean section are not presented here due to limited evidence. We used vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) as the reference method for presenting results, where data for this method were available in the network. 1) Failure to achieve vaginal delivery within 24 hours There was no clear evidence that any of the methods were more effective than vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) in reducing the risk of this outcome. Oxytocin+Amniotomy (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.24, 22.4% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence), Balloon+Misoprostol ≤ 50 μg (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.19, 5.7% fewer, high-certainty evidence), and Balloon+Oxytocin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.26, 2.3% fewer, low-certainty evidence) likely resulted in little to no difference in this outcome compared with vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg). Despite the comparable relative treatment effects between some methods and vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg), these three methods ranked highest. 2) Caesarean section due to non-reassuring fetal status There was no clear evidence that any of the methods were more effective than vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) in reducing the risk of this outcome. Balloon+Oxytocin (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.25, 2.0% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence), controlled-release dinoprostone vaginal pessary (RR 0.86, 0.62 to 1.18, 1.2% fewer, low-certainty evidence), and balloon catheters (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.11, 1.0% fewer, low-certainty evidence) may result in little to no difference in this outcome when compared with vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg). Despite the comparable relative treatment effects between all methods and vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg), these three methods ranked highest. 3) Uterine hyperstimulation with changes in the heartbeat of the baby before birth Nitric oxide donors (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.47, 3.9% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence), osmotic cervical dilators (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.42, 3.8% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence), balloon catheters (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.69, 2.5% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence), and oral misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.99, 1.6% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence) probably reduce this outcome compared with vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg). When compared with inactive interventions (placebo, no intervention, or expectant management), vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.16 to 10.35) probably increases the risk of this outcome. The three highest-ranked methods were nitric oxide donors, osmotic cervical dilators, and inactive methods (placebo, no intervention, and expectant management). 4) Perinatal death There was no clear evidence for this outcome, as it was rare (10 cases reported across trials). For women without previous caesarean section and a mix of women with or without previous caesarean section, there was no clear evidence that any of the IoL methods were more effective than vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) for the outcomes of failure to achieve vaginal delivery within 24 hours, caesarean section due to non-reassuring fetal status, and perinatal death. Nitric oxide donors, osmotic cervical dilators, balloon catheters, and oral misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) probably reduce the risk of uterine hyperstimulation with changes in the heartbeat of the baby before birth.

          "text": "We evaluated the effects of the following IoL methods: vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg), oral misoprostol (≤ 50 μg), sublingual or buccal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg), controlled-release misoprostol vaginal pessary, vaginal dinoprostone (tablet or gel), controlled-release dinoprostone vaginal pessary, oxytocin (alone), nitric oxide donors, balloon catheters, osmotic cervical dilators, oxytocin plus amniotomy (Oxytocin+Amniotomy), balloon catheters plus oxytocin (Balloon+Oxytocin), balloon catheters plus vaginal/oral misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) (Balloon+Misoprostol ≤ 50 μg), and inactive methods (placebo, no intervention, and expectant management). The following results show the relative effects of NMA for four of the six critical outcomes among women without previous caesarean section and a mix of women with or without previous caesarean section. The findings of women with previous caesarean section are not presented here due to limited evidence. We used vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) as the reference method for presenting results, where data for this method were available in the network. 1) Failure to achieve vaginal delivery within 24 hours There was no clear evidence that any of the methods were more effective than vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) in reducing the risk of this outcome. Oxytocin+Amniotomy (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.24, 22.4% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence), Balloon+Misoprostol ≤ 50 μg (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.19, 5.7% fewer, high-certainty evidence), and Balloon+Oxytocin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.26, 2.3% fewer, low-certainty evidence) likely resulted in little to no difference in this outcome compared with vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg). Despite the comparable relative treatment effects between some methods and vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg), these three methods ranked highest. 2) Caesarean section due to non-reassuring fetal status There was no clear evidence that any of the methods were more effective than vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) in reducing the risk of this outcome. Balloon+Oxytocin (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.25, 2.0% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence), controlled-release dinoprostone vaginal pessary (RR 0.86, 0.62 to 1.18, 1.2% fewer, low-certainty evidence), and balloon catheters (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.11, 1.0% fewer, low-certainty evidence) may result in little to no difference in this outcome when compared with vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg). Despite the comparable relative treatment effects between all methods and vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg), these three methods ranked highest. 3) Uterine hyperstimulation with changes in the heartbeat of the baby before birth Nitric oxide donors (RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.47, 3.9% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence), osmotic cervical dilators (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.42, 3.8% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence), balloon catheters (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.69, 2.5% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence), and oral misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.99, 1.6% fewer, moderate-certainty evidence) probably reduce this outcome compared with vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg). When compared with inactive interventions (placebo, no intervention, or expectant management), vaginal misoprostol (≤ 50 μg) (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.16 to 10.35) probably increases the risk of this outcome. The three highest-ranked methods were nitric oxide donors, osmotic cervical dilators, and inactive methods (placebo, no intervention, and expectant management). 4) Perinatal death There was no clear evidence for this outcome, as it was rare (10 cases reported across trials)."

In this study, we hypothesised that SGLT2 inhibitor prevents diabetic kidney disease via reduction of hypoxia-induced factors. In this multicenter, prospective, randomised, double blinded clinical trial, people with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria were randomised equally to empagliflozin (10 mg/day) (n = 40) and placebo (n = 39) and followed 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in urinary albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) and urinary liver type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP) excretion from baseline to 24 weeks. Major secondary outcome was change in serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-like proteins 2 (ANGPTL2), angiopoietin-like proteins 4 (ANGPTL4), and adrenomedullin (AM) levels. Although the reduction of ACR was significantly greater in the empagliflozin group than the placebo group at 4 and 12 weeks, the difference of change at 24 weeks between the two groups was not statistically significant (Empagliflozin group-Placebo group: -0.3643, 95% CI: -0.7571 to 0.0285, p = 0.0686). There was no difference in urinary L-FABP excretion between the empagliflozin and placebo groups. Serum VEGF and ANGPTL2 decreased significantly more in the empagliflozin group, whereas there were no significant differences in AM and ANGPTL4. These results demonstrated that empagliflozin partially suppressed the hypoxia-induced angiogenic factors overproduction in addition to a declining trend in ACR in the early stage of diabetic kidney disease, which might contribute to the mechanisms of reno-protective effects of this agent (jRCTs051200147).",

Careful selection of patients in whom PFO is more likely to be the cause of stroke may improve outcomes by avoiding closure in patients unlikely to benefit. To determine whether the PFO-Associated Stroke Causal Likelihood (PASCAL) classification system identifies who will experience net benefit and net harm from PFO closure. This meta-analysis was a secondary analysis of individual participant-level data from the Systematic, Collaborative, PFO Closure Evaluation (SCOPE) consortium meta-analysis, including all 6 randomized trials of transcatheter PFO closure vs antithrombotic therapy alone. Participants were young and middle-aged adults (mean [SD] age, 45 [10] years) with a PFO and an otherwise cryptogenic stroke. The trials were conducted in hospitals in North America, Europe, Australia, Brazil, and South Korea from 2000 to 2017. The current analysis, involving all trial participants, was performed from January to August 2025. Transcatheter PFO closure plus antithrombotic therapy vs antithrombotic therapy alone. The primary efficacy end point was recurrent ischemic stroke. The primary safety end point was first-ever detection of AF beyond the periprocedural period (>45 days after randomization). The 6 trials enrolled 3740 patients (1889 who had PFO closure, 1851 who had medical therapy); 2058 patients (55.0%) were male, and 1682 (45.0%) were female. Among patients in all 6 trials, PASCAL classified PFO relatedness to the index stroke as probable in 1382 patients (37.0%), possible in 1811 (48.4%), and unlikely in 547 (14.6%); among the 2967 patients in the 4 trials with broad entry criteria, PASCAL classified PFO relatedness as probable in 860 patients (29.0%), possible in 1565 (52.7%), and unlikely in 543 (18.3%). The reduction in the absolute rate of recurrent ischemic strokes over 5 years was greater than the increase in first-ever detection of AF in the postperiprocedural period as follows: in the probable group, fewer strokes, -2.5% (95% CI, -4.2% to -1.3%) vs more late AF, 1.3% (95% CI, 0.0% to 2.5%), and in the possible group, fewer strokes -3.4% (95% CI, -5.4% to -1.3%) vs more late AF, 1.1% (95% CI, -0.5% to 2.6%). Reduction in recurrent ischemic strokes was not observed and increase in first-ever detected postperiprocedural AF was magnified in the unlikely group (more strokes, 0.4%; 95% CI, -4.0% to 4.8%, vs more late AF, 4.6%; 95% CI, 0.3% to 8.9%). Among young and middle-aged patients with PFO and otherwise cryptogenic stroke, the PASCAL classification algorithm distinguished the 4 of every 5 patients in the probable and possible groups with net benefit and the 1 of every 5 patients in the unlikely group with net harm from closure.",

In these studies, we sought to compare a single-pill combination of 1.67 mg amlodipine, 16.67 mg losartan potassium, and 4.17 mg chlorthalidone (LDC-ALC) with standard-dose monotherapy-5 mg amlodipine or 50 mg losartan potassium-in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.

Study 301 compared LDC-ALC and amlodipine; Study 302 compared LDC-ALC and losartan. Adults (≥19 years of age) with systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 to <180 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) <110 mm Hg after 4-week placebo run-in were randomized to 8 weeks of treatment.

Co-primary outcomes were (i) the composite of all cause death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or urgent target-vessel revascularization (ischaemic outcome) and (ii) Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding. At 30 days, the composite ischaemic outcome occurred in 3.3% of patients receiving monotherapy vs 1.8% with DAPT (risk difference 1.5%, 95% confidence interval .4%-2.6%; P = .006). Bleeding occurred in .6% vs 1.5% (risk difference -.8%, 95% confidence interval -1.5%-.1%; P = .018). In the landmark analysis between Days 31 and 365, ischaemic outcome rates were similar between study groups (3.8% each; P = .977), while bleeding remained less frequent with monotherapy (1.3% vs 3.5%; risk difference -2.2%, 95% confidence interval -3.2%-1.1%; P > .001). This prespecified 30-day landmark analysis suggests an excess of ischaemic risk with monotherapy vs DAPT in the first 30 days but not thereafter, whereas an aspirin-free strategy was consistently associated with fewer bleeding events within and after 30 days.",

      "abstract": "Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is common in women and frequently associated with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). SUI may be present following prolapse reduction (occult SUI) and may develop after surgery for POP (new-onset SUI). To determine the impact of surgery for symptomatic POP, with or without concomitant or delayed two-stage continence procedures, to treat or prevent SUI, on postoperative bladder function. We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, two trials registries, journals and conference proceedings (searched 29 April 2024, updated 23 July 2025), and reference lists of articles. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including surgical interventions for POP with or without continence procedures in continent or incontinent women. Our primary outcome was subjective postoperative SUI. Secondary outcomes included POP on examination, overactive bladder, further continence surgery, and voiding dysfunction. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We assessed evidence certainty using GRADE. We included 22 RCTs with 3095 women. Evidence certainty ranged from low to moderate. Limitations were risk of bias (especially blinding of outcome assessors), indirectness, and imprecision associated with low event rates and small samples. POP surgery in women with SUI Vaginal POP surgery with versus without midurethral sling: a concomitant midurethral sling may decrease SUI, (risk ratio (RR) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.48; 2 studies, 319 women), and rates of further continence surgery (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.74; 1 study, 134 women), both low-certainty evidence. This suggests that if the risk of SUI with POP surgery alone is 39%, the risk with midurethral sling is between 8% and 19%. Vaginal POP surgery with concomitant versus delayed midurethral sling: low-certainty evidence suggested little or no difference in SUI (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.37; 1 study, 140 women). Vaginal transobturator mesh versus vaginal POP surgery with midurethral sling: evidence from one study with 84 women suggested little or no difference in SUI (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.26); POP (RR 6.29, 95% CI 0.79 to 50.03); new-onset overactive bladder (RR not estimable); and voiding dysfunction (RR 3.14, 95% CI 0.13 to 75.02), low-certainty evidence. Abdominal sacrocolpopexy with versus without Burch colposuspension: an additional Burch colposuspension may have little or no effect on SUI after five years (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.26; 45 women), or on overactive bladder (RR 0.85, 95%CI 0.61 to 1.18), new-onset overactive bladder (RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.19 to 19.73) or voiding dysfunction (RR 0.96, 95%CI 0.06 to 14.43) all after one year (1 study, 47 women, all low-certainty evidence). Abdominal sacrocolpopexy with concomitant midurethral sling or Burch colposuspension: midurethral sling may decrease SUI at two years (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.86; 113 women) but not POP (RR 1.85, 95%CI 0.18 to 19.62; 79 women), overactive bladder (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.94; 44 women), new-onset overactive bladder (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.06 to 6.09; 48 women), or voiding dysfunction (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.90; 92 women), low-certainty evidence from one study. This suggests that if the risk of SUI with Burch is 55%, the risk with midurethral sling is between 19% and 48%. POP surgery in women with occult SUI Vaginal POP surgery with versus without midurethral sling: probably decreases SUI (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.55; 5 studies, 369 women) and further continence surgery rates (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.53; 4 studies, 279 women) both moderate-certainty evidence. This suggests that if the risk with POP surgery alone is 34%, the risk with concomitant midurethral sling is between 10% and 22%. Low-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference in POP (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.19; 1 study, 50 women), overactive bladder (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.07; 1 study, 43 women), new-onset overactive bladder (RR 2.11, 95% CI 0.73 to 6.11; 2 studies, 75 women) or voiding dysfunction (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.15 to 6.55; 1 study, 50 women). POP surgery in stress urinary continent women Vaginal POP surgery with versus without concomitant midurethral sling: there is probably no difference in SUI between groups (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.00; 1 study, 220 women; moderate-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the risk with POP surgery alone is 40%, the risk with concomitant midurethral sling is between 19% and 40%. Abdominal sacrocolpopexy with versus without Burch colposuspension: there may be little or no effect on SUI after two years (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99; I² = 75%; 2 studies, 364 women; low-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the risk with sacrocolpopexy alone is 36%, the risk with concomitant Burch colposuspension is between 19% and 36%. Low-certainty evidence from one study suggests there may be little or no difference in POP (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.30, 250 women), new-onset overactive bladder (RR 1.41, 95%CI 0.25 to 7.91, 66 women) and voiding dysfunction (RR 8.49, 95% CI 0.48 to 151.59, 66 women). Vaginal transobturator mesh repair versus native tissue repair: low-certainty evidence suggests that transobturator mesh repair may increase SUI at 3-7 years (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.91; 3 studies, 417 women) but may decrease POP (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.52 ; 3 studies, 458 women). There may be little or no difference in voiding dysfunction at 12 months (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.22 to 12.10; 2 studies, 125 women). In women with POP and symptomatic or occult SUI, a concomitant midurethral sling probably reduces SUI, but adverse effects remain unclear. It is also feasible to postpone the midurethral sling and perform a continence procedure only if required. In continent women, a Burch colposuspension during abdominal POP surgery reduced new-onset SUI rates in one underpowered study, but another RCT reported conflicting results. Adding a midurethral sling during vaginal POP repair might prevent new-onset SUI. An anterior native tissue repair might be better than vaginal transobturator mesh for preventing new SUI; however, POP recurrence may be more common with native tissue repair.",

To compare the effect of ED-initiated 7-day extended-release injectable buprenorphine vs sublingual buprenorphine on treatment engagement at 7 days. Multicenter randomized clinical trial enrolling adult patients presenting to the ED with untreated opioid use disorder and a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score of 4 or higher across 29 EDs in the US from July 12, 2020, to August 21, 2024. Final follow-up was completed on October 24, 2024. Patients were randomized to receive a 24-mg injection of extended-release buprenorphine (equivalent to 16 mg/d) or sublingual buprenorphine, which included either self-administration instructions if the COWS score was less than 8 or administration of 8 mg of sublingual buprenorphine in the ED if the COWS score was 8 or higher. All sublingual buprenorphine group patients received a 7-day prescription for 16 mg/d. Both groups were provided referral for ongoing medication with a scheduled appointment within 7 days. Engagement in opioid use disorder treatment on day 7 was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included engagement at 30 days, precipitated withdrawal and overdose events, craving scores, days of illicit opioid use, and patient satisfaction with treatment. Among 2000 patients randomized, 6 who were enrolled twice were excluded, resulting in 991 in the extended-release group and 1003 in the sublingual group. The median age was 37 (IQR, 30-47) years, 68% were male, 31% had an initial COWS score of 4 to 7, and 76% tested positive for fentanyl. The adjusted proportion of engagement in opioid use disorder treatment at 7 days was 40.5% with extended-release buprenorphine vs 38.5% with sublingual buprenorphine (adjusted difference, 1.6%; 95% CI, -2.8% to 6.0%). Engagement at 30 days was similar, with adjusted proportions of 43.8% with extended-release buprenorphine vs 44.9% with sublingual buprenorphine (adjusted difference, -1.5%; 95% CI, -6.2% to 3.2%). Precipitated withdrawal was rare: 6 (0.6%) with extended-release buprenorphine and 8 (0.8%) with sublingual buprenorphine. Overdose events within 30 days occurred in 18 participants (2.3%) in each group. Patients receiving extended-release buprenorphine reported lower mean craving scores at 7 days vs those receiving sublingual buprenorphine (scale, 0-100; mean score, 26.5 vs 30.2, respectively; adjusted mean difference, -3.85; 95% CI, -7.08 to -0.63), fewer days of illicit opioid use in the past 7 days (adjusted ratio of means, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.95), and better treatment satisfaction scores (scale, 1-5; adjusted mean difference, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.01-0.25). No difference was detected in opioid use disorder treatment engagement on day 7 between the 7-day extended-release and sublingual buprenorphine groups. Both buprenorphine formulations were well tolerated; precipitated withdrawal was rare despite a high prevalence of fentanyl. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04225598.",

Patients receiving extended-release buprenorphine reported lower mean craving scores at 7 days vs those receiving sublingual buprenorphine (scale, 0-100; mean score, 26.5 vs 30.2, respectively; adjusted mean difference, -3.85; 95% CI, -7.08 to -0.63), fewer days of illicit opioid use in the past 7 days (adjusted ratio of means, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.95), and better treatment satisfaction scores (scale, 1-5; adjusted mean difference, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.01-0.25)."

We employed a prevalent new-user design that emulates a randomized trial within the French national health care database population between 2008 and 2024. Thus, subjects initiating a second- and third-generation BCR-ABL TKI were matched on time and propensity score with users of the first-generation BCR-ABL TKI, imatinib. Patients were followed to occurrence of the primary outcome (ie, new onset of PAH), switch to another BCR-ABL TKI, death from any cause, end of registration within the database, or end of the study period, whichever came first. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models, and incidence rates and corresponding 95% CIs were calculated using the Poisson distribution. Six thousand six hundred twenty-five dasatinib (age 59.7±15.2 years, 44.0% women), 5205 nilotinib (age 55.4±15.0 years, 44.2% women), 2421 bosutinib (age 63.8±14.2 years, 42.1% women),1358 ponatinib (age 57.3±14.9 years, 46.1% women), and 922 asciminib (age 64.3±13.8 years, 43.7% female) new users were each matched with the maximum of available imatinib users on time-conditional propensity score and on duration of prior imatinib use (prevalent users).

Bosutinib and ponatinib were associated with HRs of 10.76 (95% CI, 4.68-24.73) and 7.74 (95% CI, 2.33-25.70) respectively, with most cases occurring in patients previously exposed to dasatinib. Nilotinib and asciminib were not associated with an increased risk of PAH. This study, designed to emulate a randomized trial, suggests that, in French patients with chronic myeloid leukemia treated with BCR-ABL TKIs, dasatinib use is associated with a higher risk of PAH compared with imatinib, while bosutinib and ponatinib exposure may aggravate or trigger a recurrence of PAH in patients with preexisting dasatinib exposure.

We aimed to assess the evidence for such undesirable effects more reliably through a meta-analysis of individual participant data from large double-blind trials of statin therapy. In this meta-analysis of individual participant-level data from double-blind randomised controlled trials, we generated a list of all undesirable effect terms listed in statin SmPCs by searching an electronic medicines compendium for five statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin). Randomised trials were eligible for meta-analysis of these effects if they involved at least 1000 participants, had a scheduled treatment period of at least 2 years, and involved a double-blind comparison of statin versus placebo or of a more intensive versus a less intensive statin regimen. Event rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were calculated with statistical significance assessed after controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at 5%. 19 trials compared statin versus placebo (123 940 participants, median follow-up 4·5 years [IQR 3·1-5·4]). In addition to previously reported effects on muscle outcomes and diabetes, only four of 66 further undesirable outcomes that had been attributed to statins were FDR significant: abnormal liver transaminases (783 participants [0·30% per annum] allocated statin vs 556 [0·22% per annum] allocated placebo, RR 1·41 [95% CI 1·26-1·57]) and other liver function test abnormalities (651 participants [0·25% per annum] allocated statin vs 518 [0·20% per annum] allocated placebo, RR 1·26 [1·12-1·41]; absolute annual excess of 0·13% for combined liver function test abnormality), urinary composition alteration (556 [0·21% per annum] allocated statin vs 472 [0·18% per annum] allocated placebo, RR 1·18 [1·04-1·33]), and oedema (3495 [1·38% per annum] allocated statin vs 3299 [1·31% per annum] allocated placebo, RR 1·07 [1·02-1·12]). Analysis of the four trials of more intensive versus less intensive statin regimens also found significant excesses for abnormal liver transaminases and other liver function test abnormalities (supporting a dose-dependent effect), but no significant excess was found for urinary composition alteration or oedema.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of switching to doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) from bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1. This phase 3, randomised, controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority trial was conducted at 49 research, community, and hospital-based clinics in six countries: Australia, Chile, Israel, Japan, the UK, and the USA. Adults aged 18 years or older with HIV-1, who were virologically suppressed (with a viral load of HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per mL) for at least 3 consecutive months on bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide and had no history of treatment failure or known resistance to doravirine, were eligible for the study. Participants were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule with a block size of three, to switch to oral doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) or to continue bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, once daily. Participants, investigators, study staff, and sponsor personnel were masked to study treatment; sponsor personnel directly involved in this analysis were unmasked at week 48. The primary endpoint, which was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study treatment, was the percentage of participants with a viral load of 50 copies per mL or higher at week 48 according to the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot approach; non-inferiority would be concluded if the upper bound of the multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI for the treatment difference was less than 4%. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05630755, and is ongoing but closed to enrolment. Between Feb 17 and Nov 17, 2023, 585 individuals were screened, of whom 514 were randomly assigned and 513 treated: 342 participants were switched to doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) and 171 continued bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide. The median age of the 513 participants was 47 years (IQR 37-58), 403 (79%) were assigned male and 110 (21%) were assigned female at birth, 158 (31%) were Black or African American, and 117 (23%) were Hispanic, Latino, or Latina. At week 48, doravirine and islatravir showed non-inferiority to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (viral load ≥50 copies per mL in five [1·5%] of 342 vs one [0·6%] of 171 participants) with a treatment difference of 0·9% (multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI -1·9 to 2·9). The rates of adverse events (74·6% [255 of 342 participants] vs 71·3% [122 of 171 participants]; difference 3·2 [95% CI -4·7 to 11·6]), treatment-related adverse events (10·2% [35] vs 9·4% [16]; 0·9 [-5·1 to 6·0]), serious adverse events (4·4% [15] vs 6·4% [11]; -2·0 [-7·1 to 1·9]), and discontinuations due to adverse events (2·9% [ten] vs 1·8% [three]; 1·2 [-2·3 to 3·9]) were similar in the doravirine and islatravir group and the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group, and no deaths were reported. The combination of doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) has similar efficacy and safety profiles to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, and could provide a two-drug, once daily, oral single-tablet option without an integrase strand-transfer inhibitor for adults who are virologically suppressed and want to switch to a different ART regimen.

The primary endpoint, which was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study treatment, was the percentage of participants with a viral load of 50 copies per mL or higher at week 48 according to the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot approach; non-inferiority would be concluded if the upper bound of the multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI for the treatment difference was less than 4%. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05630755, and is ongoing but closed to enrolment."

The median age of the 513 participants was 47 years (IQR 37-58), 403 (79%) were assigned male and 110 (21%) were assigned female at birth, 158 (31%) were Black or African American, and 117 (23%) were Hispanic, Latino, or Latina. At week 48, doravirine and islatravir showed non-inferiority to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (viral load ≥50 copies per mL in five [1·5%] of 342 vs one [0·6%] of 171 participants) with a treatment difference of 0·9% (multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI -1·9 to 2·9). The rates of adverse events (74·6% [255 of 342 participants] vs 71·3% [122 of 171 participants]; difference 3·2 [95% CI -4·7 to 11·6]), treatment-related adverse events (10·2% [35] vs 9·4% [16]; 0·9 [-5·1 to 6·0]), serious adverse events (4·4% [15] vs 6·4% [11]; -2·0 [-7·1 to 1·9]), and discontinuations due to adverse events (2·9% [ten] vs 1·8% [three]; 1·2 [-2·3 to 3·9]) were similar in the doravirine and islatravir group and the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group, and no deaths were reported."

      "abstract": "To conduct an updated systematic review of the current evidence on the implementation of the 'Atrial fibrillation Better Care' (ABC) pathway for the comprehensive and holistic management of patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF).We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies reporting the prevalence of ABC-adherent management in patients with AF and its association with clinical outcomes (all-cause death, cardiovascular death, stroke, stroke/thromboembolism (TE), and major bleeding). Random-effects models were used to pool results from individual studies; subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were also conducted.Overall, 22 studies were included (including 2 randomised trials), with >380,000 AF patients. Adherence to the ABC pathway was 23.9% (95%CI: 17.5%-31.7%), with substantial between-study heterogeneity (I: 99.8%). Adherence was higher in European cohorts (37.9%, 95%CI: 27.8%-49.2%) and increased with advancing age. ABC pathway adherence was associated with a lower risk of all-cause death (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.49, 95%CI: 0.41-0.58, I²: 97.1%), cardiovascular death (OR: 0.46, 95%CI: 0.36-0.59, I²: 96.4%), stroke (OR: 0.65, 95%CI: 0.51-0.82, I²: 93.5%), stroke/TE (OR: 0.53, 95%CI: 0.42-0.66, I²: 91.1%) and major bleeding (OR: 0.81, 95%CI: 0.69-0.94, I²: 89.2%). The effect of the ABC pathway was consistent in clinical trials versus real-world studies, but influenced by study-level characteristics, including geographical location, mean age, prevalence of comorbidities, and the inclusion of estimates adjusted for potential confounders.Adherence to the ABC pathway remains suboptimal in patients with AF, but is associated with substantial beneficial effects on prognosis. Our data support widespread implementation of the ABC pathway for managing patients with AF.",

To compare the clinical outcomes of ticagrelor vs prasugrel, each in combination with aspirin, in patients with diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention. The Ultrathin Strut vs Xience in a Diabetic Population With Multivessel Disease 2-India Study (TUXEDO-2) is an investigator-initiated, prospective, open-label, multicenter, 2 × 2 factorial design, 1:1 randomized clinical trial. Participants with diabetes and multivessel disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention were enrolled at 66 clinical sites from February 2020 to August 2024. Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention were randomized to receive either ticagrelor or prasugrel, each in combination with low-dose aspirin. The primary outcome was a composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or major bleeding as defined by the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium at 1 year. The trial was designed to test the noninferiority of ticagrelor compared with prasugrel with a noninferiority margin of 5%. Among the 1800 participants randomized, mean (SD) age was 60 (10) years with 1296 (72.0%) male participants, 436 (24.2%) receiving insulin therapy, and 1530 (85.0%) with triple-vessel disease.
