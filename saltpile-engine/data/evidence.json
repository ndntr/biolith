      "abstract": "For >60 years, beta-blockers have been first-line therapy for symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM), although limited data support this recommendation. The MAPLE-HCM trial showed greater improvement in exercise capacity and secondary endpoints for aficamten monotherapy vs metoprolol monotherapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of aficamten vs metoprolol across multiple clinically relevant and patient-centric measures of disease burden in oHCM. Patients with oHCM and left ventricular outflow tract gradient (LVOT-G) ≥30 mm Hg at rest and/or ≥50 mm Hg with Valsalva were randomly assigned to aficamten (n = 88) or metoprolol (n = 87). Dose titration was based on vital signs and echocardiograms. Assessment of clinical response by treatment arm was based on improvement in multiple parameters reflecting oHCM disease burden: LVOT-G <30 mm Hg at rest and <50 mm Hg with Valsalva; ≥1 class improvement in NYHA functional class and/or ≥10-point improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CSS); ≥50% reduction in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide; ≥1.0 mL/kg/min increase in peak oxygen consumption (pVO); and ≥10% reduction in left atrial volume index. Clinical response was classified by number of efficacy outcomes achieved: nonresponder (none), limited (1 or 2), positive (3 or 4), or complete (all 5). Baseline characteristics were similar for both treatment groups. For the overall cohort, mean age was 58 ± 13.2 years; 73 (42%) were women, 103 (70%) were in NYHA functional class II and 52 (30%) in class III, mean pVO was 19.9 ± 5.1 mL/kg/min, and mean KCCQ-CSS score was 66 ± 16. At 24 weeks, aficamten treatment was associated with greater benefits in all efficacy outcome measures, with numbers needed to treat ranging from 1.5 to 5.0 relative to metoprolol treatment. Patients treated with aficamten were more likely to be either positive or complete responders compared with patients treated with metoprolol (78% vs 3%, respectively; P < 0.001). In patients with symptomatic oHCM, aficamten monotherapy led to superior and rapid treatment benefits across several clinically relevant outcome measures of disease burden compared with metoprolol. These observations support the emerging role of aficamten as monotherapy for oHCM.

The efficacy and safety of pegcetacoplan, a C3 and C3b inhibitor, in persons with C3 glomerulopathy or primary immune-complex MPGN are unclear. We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving adolescents and adults with C3 glomerulopathy or primary immune-complex MPGN, including those with native kidney disease and those with disease recurrence after transplantation. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive pegcetacoplan or placebo. The primary end point was the log-transformed ratio of the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio at week 26 as compared with baseline. A total of 124 patients underwent randomization. The change in proteinuria (as measured by the log-transformed ratio to baseline in the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio) was significantly greater with pegcetacoplan than with placebo (geometric mean of the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio, -67.2% [95% confidence interval {CI}, -74.9 to -57.2] vs. 2.9% [95% CI, -8.6 to 15.9]). The difference represents a relative reduction of 68.1% (95% CI, 57.3 to 76.2) as compared with placebo. In hierarchical testing of five secondary end points, significantly higher percentages of patients in the pegcetacoplan group than in the placebo group met the composite renal end-point criteria (stabilization of estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] and ≥50% reduction in urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio) (49% vs. 3%) and had at least a 50% reduction in the protein-to-creatinine ratio (60% vs. 5%). Among 69 patients with evaluable kidney-biopsy samples, the change in the activity score of the C3 glomerulopathy histologic index did not differ significantly between the two groups; subsequent end points (decrease in C3 staining and change in eGFR) were not formally tested. Pegcetacoplan was not associated with more adverse events than placebo. No serious infections from encapsulated bacteria occurred; 1 patient receiving pegcetacoplan died from coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. No allograft rejection or loss occurred.

This nationwide, population-based cohort study included pregnancies resulting in live births in Korea from 2010 through 2021. A sequential landmark analysis was conducted, with OCS exposure assessed in 3-week intervals between 1 and 27 weeks' gestation. Data were analyzed from June 26, 2024, to September 19, 2025. Pregnancies among women who were exposed to OCSs were compared with pregnancies among women who were not exposed to OCSs within each 3-week interval and in pooled analyses.

Propensity score-based overlap weighting was applied to adjust for comorbidities, medication use, and health care utilization.

      "abstract": "Diabetes is a critical risk factor for cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Type 2 diabetes increases all-cause and cardiovascular death and impairs health-related quality of life. More than a third of people with type 2 diabetes develop kidney failure, requiring treatment with dialysis or kidney transplantation. People with CKD and type 2 diabetes have a substantially higher risk of premature cardiovascular complications. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are glucose-lowering agents that achieve glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes and may prevent poor kidney and cardiovascular outcomes for people with CKD and type 2 diabetes. However, new trials are emerging rapidly, and continuous evidence synthesis is essential to summarising cumulative evidence. This review aims to assess the benefits and harms of DPP-4 inhibitors in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 25 March 2025 using a search strategy designed by an Information Specialist. Studies in the Register are continually identified through regular searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomised controlled studies (RCTs) were eligible if they compared treatment with a DPP-4 inhibitor against placebo, standard medical care (including usual other glucose-lowering agents or no treatment), or another glucose-lowering agent in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes. We included all CKD categories (from 1 to 5), including people treated with dialysis. People with type 1 diabetes and kidney transplant recipients were excluded. The critical review outcomes were cardiovascular death and hypoglycaemia requiring third-party assistance. The key important outcomes included 3- and 4-point major cardiovascular events (MACE), nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and kidney failure. The risk of bias version 2 tool was used to assess the studies. Three review authors independently extracted data and assessed the study risk of bias. Treatment estimates were summarised using random effects meta-analysis and expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD), with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Evidence certainty was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Fifty-nine studies involving 27,893 participants were included. DPP-4 inhibitors with or without other background treatments were compared to placebo, standard medical care, sodium-glucose cotransport 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sulfonylurea, other DPP-4 inhibitors, insulin, or alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. There were no studies evaluating treatment in children. We contacted 10 authors from primary studies to retrieve additional information, but no further data were added to this review. Compared to placebo or standard medical care, DPP-4 inhibitors may have little or no effect on the risk of cardiovascular death (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.14; 6 studies, 7568 participants; low-certainty evidence) and hypoglycaemia requiring third-party assistance in people with all CKD categories (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.25; I² = 0%; 10 studies, 8994 participants; low-certainty evidence). DPP-4 inhibitors probably have little or no effect on 3-point MACE compared with placebo (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.17; 1 study, 6979 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). DPP-4 inhibitors had uncertain effects on the risk of 4-point MACE compared with placebo (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.88; 1 study, 133 participants; very low-certainty evidence), nonfatal myocardial infarction compared with placebo in people with CKD categories 3-5, including those on dialysis (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.36 to 10.08; 1 study, 133 participants; very-low-certainty evidence), or nonfatal stroke compared with placebo (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.97; 1 study, 133 participants; very-low-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo or standard medical care, DPP-4 inhibitors probably have little or no effect on kidney failure in people with all CKD categories (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.53; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 7472 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The effects of DPP-4 inhibitors compared to other glucose-lowering agents were uncertain. No studies evaluated treatment on the clinical outcomes of life participation, lactic acidosis, blindness, diabetic ketoacidosis, peritoneal dialysis infection, or peritoneal dialysis failure. The overall risk of bias was assessed as low or very low for most included studies. DPP-4 inhibitors had an uncertain effect on the risks of cardiovascular death and hypoglycaemia requiring third-party assistance in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes when compared with placebo or standard medical care, whilst the effects on other glucose-lowering agents were uncertain. Despite the large number of studies, there is little evidence that DPP-4 inhibitors prevent key adverse clinical outcomes for people who have CKD and type 2 diabetes. Future well-designed and adequately powered RCTs can provide better information about the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors on key patient-reported outcomes and cost to better inform decision-making and clinical practice in this setting.

Type 2 diabetes increases all-cause and cardiovascular death and impairs health-related quality of life. More than a third of people with type 2 diabetes develop kidney failure, requiring treatment with dialysis or kidney transplantation. People with CKD and type 2 diabetes have a substantially higher risk of premature cardiovascular complications. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are glucose-lowering agents that achieve glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes and may prevent poor kidney and cardiovascular outcomes for people with CKD and type 2 diabetes. However, new trials are emerging rapidly, and continuous evidence synthesis is essential to summarising cumulative evidence."

To evaluate the risk and excess burden of neurological events in a cohort of DENV-infected adults in the acute postinfectious period vs population-based comparators without DENV infection. This was a retrospective, population-based cohort study in Singapore. National registries were used to construct a cohort of all adults (aged ≥18 years) infected with DENV from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2023, for whom the index date (time 0 [T0]) was taken as the date of notification, and a cohort of uninfected population-based comparators, for whom T0 was randomly assigned to match T0 distribution in DENV-infected cases. As the period overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 within 30 days of T0 were additionally excluded, as were individuals who died before T0 and uninfected comparators with no prior health care contact. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 2017, through March 30, 2024. DENV infection recorded in the national registry. New-incident neurological events, including any neurological event, memory loss, movement disorders, and other neurological disorders (eg, fatigue or malaise, encephalitis or encephalopathy), following DENV infection were identified using national health care claims records, and risk was assessed over the acute follow-up period. Odds of new-incident neurological events in DENV-infected cases vs uninfected comparators were estimated using overlap-weighted logistic regression at 30 to 90 days after T0. A total of 65 207 confirmed DENV-infected cases (mean [SD] age, 48.4 [17.8] years; 34 876 [53.5%] male) were compared against 1 616 865 uninfected comparators (mean [SD] age, 54.8 [18.3] years; 730 702 [45.2%] male). At 30 days following DENV infection, individuals with DENV infection, compared with uninfected individuals, had elevated odds of any new-incident neurological event (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 9.69; 95% CI, 6.59-14.90), memory loss (aOR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.36-8.69), movement disorders (aOR, 7.10; 95% CI, 2.49-29.18), and other neurological events (aOR, 14.32; 95% CI, 8.61-26.04); risk trajectories diverged up to 90 days after infection. However, the overall excess burden was modest, with less than 1 excess event per 100 cases. The DENV-infected cases, compared with uninfected individuals, had increased odds of memory loss (aOR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.30-7.87) and movement disorders (aOR, 6.38; 95% CI, 2.23-25.96) only among those aged 60 years or older and in cases infected during DENV serotype 3 transmission. DENV infection was associated with significantly higher odds of acute new-incident neurological events following infection, although the excess burden was modest. Older adults should be monitored for a wider spectrum of potential neurological complications following DENV infection.",

      "abstract": "Blepharitis is a common ocular condition characterized by inflammation of the eyelid margins, which can cause irritating symptoms and ocular surface damage. Conventional treatment of blepharitis consists of eyelid hygiene and artificial tears. To suppress inflammation, topical corticosteroids, with or without antibiotics, are frequently prescribed. However, long-term use is limited by side effects such as increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma and/or cataract formation. Newer steroid-sparing topical immunosuppressants have emerged as alternative treatments. To assess the benefits and harms of topical immunosuppressants for blepharitis in adults. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and three trial registries from inception to 6 April 2025. We searched the reference lists of included studies for any additional studies not identified by the electronic searches. There were no date or language restrictions on the selection of eligible studies. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical immunosuppressants (corticosteroids, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus) of different doses or carrier, with placebo, no treatment, conventional treatment (lid hygiene, artificial tears) or other topical immunosuppressants in adults with blepharitis. We excluded paired-eye studies and highly specific blepharitis subtypes. Our outcomes were: (1) change from baseline in composite (or total) symptom score; (2) change from baseline in tear film breakup time; (3) change from baseline in corneal staining scores; (4) proportion of individuals experiencing symptomatic improvement; (5) reduction in number of or eradication of colonies of positive cultures of bacteria; (6) quality of life measures; (7) economic costs of different topical immunosuppressants; and (8) adverse effects. We used Cochrane's risk of bias (RoB) 2 tool for all outcomes reported in the summary of findings tables. Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used fixed-effect meta-analysis to combine data and forest plots to assess heterogeneity, effect size, and direction. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. When meta-analysis was not possible, we used narrative synthesis. We included 12 RCTs with 2752 participants (2802 eyes) in total. Six of the trials were conducted in the USA. Topical corticosteroid was the most frequently studied immunosuppressant, followed by cyclosporine and tacrolimus. The point of assessment and duration of treatment ranged from two to 12 weeks. No study measured the proportion of individuals experiencing symptomatic improvement. We report outcomes of interest for three key comparisons below at four to 12 weeks. No study assessed reduction or eradication of colonies of positive cultures of bacteria, quality of life or economic costs. Topical corticosteroids (with or without antibiotics) versus placebo The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of topical corticosteroids on composite symptom scores (corticosteroids with antibiotics: standard mean difference [SMD] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31 to 1.44; 2 studies, 57 participants; corticosteroids alone: SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.20; 2 studies, 232 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported tear breakup time. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of topical corticosteroids on corneal staining scores (corticosteroids with antibiotics: MD 0.70, 95% CI -1.05 to 2.45; 1 study, 27 participants; corticosteroids alone: MD 0.50, 95% CI -1.22 to 2.22; 1 study, 27 participants); both, very low-certainty evidence. The adverse event of irritation of the ocular surface was reported narratively and was similar between the two groups. The adverse event of ocular hypertension was reported narratively and not detected in either group in one study where it was reported. Topical corticosteroids (with or without antibiotics) versus antibiotics The evidence for topical corticosteroids was inconclusive. One study found that topical corticosteroid with antibiotic treatment may reduce symptom scores more than antibiotics alone (MD -11.34, 95% CI -13.13 to -9.55; 1 study, 148 participants), whereas the other found that it may have little to no effect (MD 0.40, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.91; 1 study, 201 participants); both, low-certainty evidence. Topical corticosteroids plus antibiotics probably result in greater reduction in corneal staining scores compared with antibiotics alone (MD -1.26, 95% CI -1.56 to -0.96; 1 study, 148 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). However, this effect was not observed for tear breakup time when antibiotics alone are likely to perform better (MD -1.10, 95% CI -1.39 to -0.81; 1 study, 148 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The adverse event of irritation of the ocular surface was reported narratively, and was similar between the two groups. The adverse event of ocular hypertension was reported narratively, and was higher in the corticosteroid (with or without antibiotics) group. Topical cyclosporine versus placebo Topical cyclosporine may have little to no effect on the composite symptom score compared with placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (SMD 0.15, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.57; 2 studies, 90 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of topical cyclosporine on tear breakup time compared with placebo (invasive time: MD 4.70, 95% CI -0.24 to 9.64; 1 study, 26 participants, although for non-invasive time, it may provide a potential benefit: MD 1.59, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.70; 1 study, 64 participants; both very low-certainty evidence). Topical cyclosporine may improve corneal staining compared with placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 2.60, 95% CI 0.68 to 4.52; 1 study, 26 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported adverse events. Topical corticosteroids, with or without antibiotics, including cyclosporine may make little to no difference in reducing signs and symptoms of blepharitis at four to 12 weeks, compared with placebo or antibiotics alone. Topical corticosteroids are generally well tolerated and associated with minimal risk of ocular surface irritation. Topical corticosteroids plus antibiotics probably improve corneal staining compared to antibiotics alone. When managing patients with blepharitis, clinicians should consider the limited quantity and very low certainty of evidence for topical corticosteroids. Conventional lid hygiene and warm compress remain valid therapeutic options.

No study assessed reduction or eradication of colonies of positive cultures of bacteria, quality of life or economic costs. Topical corticosteroids (with or without antibiotics) versus placebo The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of topical corticosteroids on composite symptom scores (corticosteroids with antibiotics: standard mean difference [SMD] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31 to 1.44; 2 studies, 57 participants; corticosteroids alone: SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.20; 2 studies, 232 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported tear breakup time. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of topical corticosteroids on corneal staining scores (corticosteroids with antibiotics: MD 0.70, 95% CI -1.05 to 2.45; 1 study, 27 participants; corticosteroids alone: MD 0.50, 95% CI -1.22 to 2.22; 1 study, 27 participants); both, very low-certainty evidence. The adverse event of irritation of the ocular surface was reported narratively and was similar between the two groups. The adverse event of ocular hypertension was reported narratively and not detected in either group in one study where it was reported. Topical corticosteroids (with or without antibiotics) versus antibiotics The evidence for topical corticosteroids was inconclusive. One study found that topical corticosteroid with antibiotic treatment may reduce symptom scores more than antibiotics alone (MD -11.34, 95% CI -13.13 to -9.55; 1 study, 148 participants), whereas the other found that it may have little to no effect (MD 0.40, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.91; 1 study, 201 participants); both, low-certainty evidence. Topical corticosteroids plus antibiotics probably result in greater reduction in corneal staining scores compared with antibiotics alone (MD -1.26, 95% CI -1.56 to -0.96; 1 study, 148 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). However, this effect was not observed for tear breakup time when antibiotics alone are likely to perform better (MD -1.10, 95% CI -1.39 to -0.81; 1 study, 148 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The adverse event of irritation of the ocular surface was reported narratively, and was similar between the two groups. The adverse event of ocular hypertension was reported narratively, and was higher in the corticosteroid (with or without antibiotics) group. Topical cyclosporine versus placebo Topical cyclosporine may have little to no effect on the composite symptom score compared with placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (SMD 0.15, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.57; 2 studies, 90 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of topical cyclosporine on tear breakup time compared with placebo (invasive time: MD 4.70, 95% CI -0.24 to 9.64; 1 study, 26 participants, although for non-invasive time, it may provide a potential benefit: MD 1.59, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.70; 1 study, 64 participants; both very low-certainty evidence). Topical cyclosporine may improve corneal staining compared with placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 2.60, 95% CI 0.68 to 4.52; 1 study, 26 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported adverse events."

          "text": "Topical corticosteroids, with or without antibiotics, including cyclosporine may make little to no difference in reducing signs and symptoms of blepharitis at four to 12 weeks, compared with placebo or antibiotics alone. Topical corticosteroids are generally well tolerated and associated with minimal risk of ocular surface irritation. Topical corticosteroids plus antibiotics probably improve corneal staining compared to antibiotics alone. When managing patients with blepharitis, clinicians should consider the limited quantity and very low certainty of evidence for topical corticosteroids. Conventional lid hygiene and warm compress remain valid therapeutic options."

Whether this survival advantage persists among adults with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown. To examine sex differences in mortality and treatment with kidney replacement therapy (KRT; including dialysis and transplant) among adults with incident stage 5 CKD. This population-based cohort study used linked administrative and kidney care program data from Alberta, Canada. Adults 18 years and older with incident non-KRT-dependent stage 5 CKD were identified between April 2005 and March 2019 and observed from study entry until death, out-migration, or March 2021. Data were analyzed from January to August 2025. Sex-specific, age-stratified standardized mortality ratios were calculated using general population mortality data. Five-year probabilities of all-cause death, receipt of maintenance dialysis, and kidney transplant were estimated in incident stage 5 CKD cases using multistate models, stratified by age and presence of diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Among 7506 cohort members, 4121 (54.9%) were male (median [IQR] age, 70 [58-80] years), and 3385 (45.1%) were female (median [IQR] age, 74 [61-83] years). The median (IQR) follow-up was 7.9 (4.7-11.5) years. Compared with the general population, female individuals experienced greater excess mortality than male individuals, particularly at younger ages (eg, among adults younger than 55 years: standardized mortality ratio, 40.9 [95% CI, 34.6-47.3] in female individuals vs 15.9 [95% CI, 13.5-18.2] in male individuals); this difference narrowed with increasing age. Within the stage 5 CKD cohort, 5-year all-cause mortality risks were higher in younger female individuals than male individuals (younger than 55 years: 20.7% vs 14.6%) and similar between sexes at older ages. Irrespective of comorbidity, female individuals younger than 65 years were substantially less likely to receive a kidney transplant, and female individuals 65 years and older were less likely to receive dialysis or a transplant. In this cohort study using data from a universal health care system, across all ages, the female survival advantage observed in the general population was absent or even reversed after developing stage 5 CKD. Fewer female individuals transitioned to KRT treatment, independent of their comorbidities. Younger female individuals experienced the greatest survival disadvantage and were less likely to receive a transplant. These findings suggest that differences in treatment decision-making or inequities in access to KRT may contribute to poorer outcomes in female individuals, especially at younger ages. Further investigations are warranted to understand the potential underlying structural, social, and biological mechanisms.",

We conducted a systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar through June 13, 2025, to identify meta-analyses of RCTs assessing the effects of GLP-1RAs on various health outcomes, including cardiovascular, renal, metabolic, oncologic, gastrointestinal and other domains.

The methodological quality of each review was assessed using the AMSTAR 2, and the certainty of evidence for each association was evaluated according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework (high, moderate, low or very low certainty). We preregistered our study protocol with PROSPERO (CRD420251112823). After applying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 studies comprising 432 RCTs were included, covering 65 unique outcomes across 6 clinical domains.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (PROSPERO CRD42024539227). PubMed, PsycINFO (via EBSCOhost), CINAHL Plus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, to October 2024. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing melatonin versus placebo in adults ≥65 years with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Two reviewers extracted data; risk of bias was assessed by RoB 2. Random-effects models estimated Hedges' g and mean differences (MD), with Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple outcomes. Heterogeneity assessed via I2; publication bias via Egger's test. Ten RCTs (n = 516) were included. Melatonin increased total sleep time by MD +12.4 min (95% CI 8.1-16.7; P < .001; I2 = 72%; g = 0.42) and improved Mini-Mental State Examination scores by MD +1.8 points (95% CI 0.9-2.7; P = .002; I2 = 65%; g = 0.47). Neuropsychiatric symptoms decreased (g = -0.23; 95% CI -0.44 to -0.03; P = .02). Effects on sleep efficiency, circadian markers, depression and activities of daily living were small and nonsignificant. Melatonin yields modest improvements in sleep duration and cognition that approach clinically important thresholds but fall short of definitive efficacy. Larger, rigorously designed RCTs with harmonised outcomes and pre-specified primary endpoints are needed to confirm these findings.",

      "abstract": "Hirsutism (excessive and unwanted hair growth) is a distressing and relatively common endocrine problem in women that may prove difficult to manage. Cyproterone acetate (CPA), an antiandrogen, is frequently used to treat hirsutism, usually in combination with ethinylestradiol. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003. To assess the benefits and harms of cyproterone acetate (CPA) alone, or in combination with ethinylestradiol, and other medication in reducing hair growth and improving the endocrine profile in women with hirsutism secondary to ovarian hyperandrogenism as well as idiopathic hirsutism. We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL to 20 December 2022. We also searched the reference lists of relevant papers and clinical trial registries. We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) examining women of reproductive age with either idiopathic hirsutism or hirsutism secondary to ovarian hyperandrogenism. Hirsutism was defined as a Ferriman Gallwey (FG) score greater than 7. We included 23 studies. Only one study had more than 100 women included in the analysis. The primary outcomes were the objective and subjective assessment of clinical parameters (FG scores, linear hair growth and hair shaft diameter, women's feedback and frequency of hair removal). Secondary outcomes included endocrine parameters, side effects and withdrawals during therapy. Cyproterone acetate greater than 2 mg plus ethinylestradiol compared to cyproterone acetate 2 mg or less plus ethinylestradiol (dose comparison) After six months of treatment, we are uncertain of any difference in effect on FG scores (mean difference (MD) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.02 to 2.28; I = 0%; 2 RCTs, 145 women; very low-certainty evidence). There was likely little to no difference in free testosterone (MD 0.35 pmol/L, 95% CI -0.61 to 1.31; 1 RCT, 113 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Cyproterone acetate alone (no ethinylestradiol) compared to other interventions alone (no ethinylestradiol) There was little or no difference for CPA compared with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues on total testosterone at three months (MD 0.17 nmol/L, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.49). There was little or no evidence of an effect for CPA compared with GnRH agonist on androstenedione at three months (MD 0.66 nmol/L, 95% CI -0.44 to 1.76). Both results from one RCT (20 women; very low-certainty evidence). Cyproterone acetate plus ethinylestradiol compared to other interventions alone (no ethinylestradiol) There was little to no difference in effect for CPA plus ethinylestradiol on FG scores at six months compared with finasteride (MD 4.70, 95% CI -1.86 to 11.26; 1 RCT, 27 women; low-certainty evidence), spironolactone (MD 0.90, 95% CI -2.86 to 4.66; 1 RCT, 77 women; moderate-certainty evidence), ketoconazole (MD 0.70, 95% CI -0.84 to 2.24; 1 RCT, 81 women; moderate-certainty evidence), or pioglitazone plus flutamide plus metformin (Pio-Flu-Met) (MD 0.90, 95% CI -0.79 to 2.59; 1 RCT, 34 women; low-certainty evidence). CPA plus ethinylestradiol may improve hirsutism slightly compared with flutamide (MD 4.00, 95% CI 0.10 to 7.90; 1 RCT, 28 women). CPA plus ethinylestradiol likely results in little to no difference in total testosterone at six months compared with spironolactone (MD -0.06 nmol/L, 95% CI -1.25 to 1.13; 1 RCT, 77 women; moderate-certainty evidence), ketoconazole (MD -0.02 nmol/L, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.33; 1 RCT, 81 women; moderate-certainty evidence), or Pio-Flu-Met (MD -0.39 nmol/L, 95% CI -0.82 to 0.04; 1 RCT, 81 women; low-certainty evidence). CPA plus ethinylestradiol may be more effective than finasteride at six months (MD -1.60 nmol/L, 95% CI -2.39 to -0.81; 1 RCT, 27 women; low-certainty evidence). CPA plus ethinylestradiol may lower free testosterone slightly at six months compared to finasteride (MD -9.02 nmol/L, 95% CI -12.44 to -5.60; 1 RCT, 27 women; low-certainty evidence) or flutamide (MD -4.16 nmol/L, 95% CI -6.62 to -1.70; 1 RCT, 28 women; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference between CPA plus ethinylestradiol and spironolactone (MD 0.35 nmol/L, 95% CI -0.62 to 1.32; 1 RCT, 77 women; low-certainty evidence). CPA plus ethinylestradiol may be less effective than ketoconazole (MD 1.39 nmol/L, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.35; 1 RCT, 81 women; low-certainty evidence). Cyproterone acetate plus ethinylestradiol compared to other interventions plus ethinylestradiol CPA plus ethinylestradiol likely results in little to no difference in effect on FG scores at six months compared with finasteride plus ethinylestradiol (MD -0.91, 95% CI -1.82 to 0; 1 RCT, 26 women; moderate-certainty evidence) or spironolactone plus drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol (MD 0.69, 95% CI -0.80 to 2.18; 1 RCT, 89 women; high-certainty evidence). However, CPA plus ethinylestradiol may lower FG scores compared to spironolactone plus ethinylestradiol, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -0.93, 95% CI -1.68 to -0.19; 3 RCTs, 103 women; very low-certainty evidence). There was probably little to no difference in effect for CPA plus ethinylestradiol on total testosterone at six months compared with spironolactone plus ethinylestradiol (MD -0.20 nmol/L, 95% CI -0.64 to 0.24; 1 RCT, 45 women; moderate-certainty evidence), and likely results in little to no difference compared with drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol (MD 0.15 nmol/L, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.22; 1 RCT, 91 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Six months of CPA plus ethinylestradiol treatment likely lowered free testosterone levels compared to drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol (MD -0.31 pmol/L, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.09; 1 RCT, 91 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Data were lacking for all other outcomes in our main review comparisons. There were some differences in clinical outcome between CPA and spironolactone, CPA and flutamide, and CPA and finasteride. There were no clinical differences between CPA and the other medical therapies, possibly because of small study size, lack of standardised assessment and objective determinants of improvement in many studies. There are insufficient data presented to compare the adverse effects of all the treatment options. Larger, carefully designed studies are needed to compare efficacy and safety profiles between the therapeutic options available.",

Pregnant people at high risk for preeclampsia were randomized to treatment with either 162 mg or 81 mg aspirin daily beginning before 16 weeks of gestation until term and followed up until 6 weeks postpartum.

Umbrella review and platform for shared decision making. Six databases from inception to 19 January 2025. Study authors were contacted for additional information when necessary. Systematic reviews that used meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials were eligible if they compared a drug or non-drug intervention with a passive control in individuals with a diagnosis of ADHD. Primary outcomes were severity of ADHD symptoms, analysed by rater type (clinician-rated, parent-rated, teacher-rated, or self-rated) and time point (short term (12 weeks, or study endpoint), medium term (26 weeks), and long term (52 weeks)),acceptability (participants dropping out for any reason), and tolerability (participants dropping out owing to any side effects). Secondary outcomes included daily functioning, quality of life, comorbid symptoms, and key side effects (decreased sleep and appetite). Eligible meta-analyses were re-estimated with a standardised statistical approach. Methodological quality was assessed using AMSTAR-2. Evidence certainty was evaluated using an algorithmic version of the GRADE framework, adapted for drug and non-drug interventions. 115 of 414 full text articles were deemed eligible and 299 were excluded; the eligible articles comprised 221 unique combinations of participants, interventions, comparators, and outcomes. For each combination, the most recent and methodologically robust meta-analysis was selected for re-estimation, which gave 221 re-estimated meta-analyses in total, derived from 47 meta-analytic reports. In the short term, alpha-2 agonists, amphetamines, atomoxetine, methylphenidate, and viloxazine showed medium to large effect sizes in reducing the severity of ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents, with moderate to high certainty evidence. Methylphenidate showed consistent benefits across raters (standardised mean difference >0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 1.03; moderate or high certainty evidence). These interventions showed lower tolerability than the placebo, but this effect was not significant for methylphenidate and atomoxetine. In adults, atomoxetine, cognitive behavioural therapy, methylphenidate (and, when restricting analyses to high quality trials, amphetamines) showed at least moderate certainty evidence of efficacy on ADHD symptoms, with medium effect sizes. Methylphenidate, amphetamines, and atomoxetine had worse tolerability than placebo (methylphenidate, risk ratio 0.50, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.69; amphetamines, 0.40, 0.22 to 0.72; atomoxetine, 0.45, 0.35 to 0.58). Some non-drug interventions (acupuncture and cognitive behavioural therapy in children and adolescents, and mindfulness in adults) showed large effect sizes for ADHD symptoms, but with low certainty evidence. No high certainty, long term evidence was found for any intervention. An online platform showing effects and evidence certainty of each intervention across age groups, time points, and outcomes (https://ebiadhd-database.org/) was developed. This review provides updated evidence to inform patients, practitioners, and guideline developers how best to manage ADHD symptoms.

      "abstract": "Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyC) is a cardiac-specific sarcomeric protein with faster release kinetics compared with those of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn). The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of cMyC, measured with a novel prototype automated immunoassay, with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) for the early diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Furthermore, we derived a single blood draw dual-biomarker strategy combining hs-cTn and cMyC and compared it with the hs-cTnT/I-only strategy endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology. This was a secondary analysis from an international prospective study recruiting adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected NSTEMI. cMyC, hs-cTnT, and hs-cTnI concentrations were measured upon ED presentation. Final diagnoses were centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists blinded to cMyC values. To compare the single- and dual-biomarker strategy, safety (defined as the sensitivity and negative predictive value for ruling out index NSTEMI) and triage efficacy (defined as the proportion of patients triaged to either rule-out or rule-in) were assessed. The diagnostic endpoint was index NSTEMI. The prognostic endpoint was 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year cardiovascular death or MI. Findings were externally validated in an independent international cohort. Among 4,735 eligible patients, 854 (18%) were diagnosed with NSTEMI. The discrimination for NSTEMI at presentation was higher for cMyC (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.943; 95% CI: 0.936-0.95) than for hs-cTnT (AUC: 0.936; 95% CI: 0.929-0.944; P = 0.008). Differences were mainly driven by patients with chest pain onset ≤3 hours (AUC of 0.939 [95% CI: 0.928-0.951] vs 0.921 [95% CI: 0.907-0.936], respectively; P < 0.001). The dual-biomarker strategy increased overall triage efficacy from 26.8% (hs-cTnT only) to 60.0% (hs-cTnT and cMyC), without compromising safety during the index visit. Despite identifying up to 3 times more patients for rule-out, the dual-biomarker strategy showed comparable cumulative incidences of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction at 30 days, 1 year, and 5 years. Similar results were observed with hs-cTnI and in the external validation cohort. CMyC adds significant incremental value to hs-cTn values in the early diagnosis of NSTEMI, improving diagnostic discrimination and enabling more patients to be safely and immediately ruled out for NSTEMI. The single blood draw dual-biomarker strategy is particularly attractive in busy ED settings due to its simplicity and quick time-to-decision.

The DPP-4i group continued their original daily DPP-4i regimen for 24 weeks, whereas the cofrogliptin group discontinued the daily DPP-4i and received the investigational drug orally once every 2 weeks. All participants underwent 14-day continuous glucose monitoring at weeks 10-12 and 22-24 during the treatment period. The main endpoint was the change in glucose time in range (TIR; 3.9-10.0 mmol/L) from baseline to week 24. Additionally, the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire scores, adverse events, and hypoglycaemic events were compared between groups. The enrolment period was from 31 January 2024 to 20 November 2024. A total of 64 participants were randomized to receive either cofrogliptin (n = 31) or a daily DPP-4i (n = 33). The least squares (LS) mean (standard error) change in TIR from baseline after 24 weeks was 0.037% ± 2.506% in the cofrogliptin group compared to -9.891% ± 2.435% in the daily DPP-4i group. The LS mean difference was 9.929% (95% confidence interval: 3.064%-16.793%), which was statistically significant (p = 0.0046). The incidence, classification, and severity of adverse events were similar between the two groups. Bi-weekly cofrogliptin treatment, instead of daily DPP-4i, could effectively control blood glucose levels in a 24-week treatment period and their fluctuations and was well tolerated in Chinese patients with T2DM.",

A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts and methodologists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to prioritize clinical questions, identify patient-centered outcomes, conduct an evidence synthesis, and develop recommendations. The guideline panel agreed on 16 recommendations, of which 1 is a strong recommendation, 9 are conditional recommendations, and 6 were identified as knowledge gaps. In adult patients with moderate-to-severely active CD, the AGA recommends the use of infliximab, adalimumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab, guselkumab, or upadacitinib over no treatment, and suggests the use of certolizumab pegol or vedolizumab over no treatment. In individuals who are naïve to advanced therapies, the AGA suggests using a higher efficacy medication (infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab, or guselkumab) rather than a lower-efficacy medication (certolizumab pegol or upadacitinib). In individuals who have previously been exposed to 1 or more advanced therapies, the AGA suggests using a higher efficacy medication (adalimumab, risankizumab, guselkumab, or upadacitinib) or intermediate efficacy medication (ustekinumab or mirikizumab) rather than a lower efficacy medication (vedolizumab or certolizumab pegol). In adult outpatients with moderate-to-severely active CD, the AGA suggests against using thiopurine monotherapy for induction of remission, but suggests using thiopurine monotherapy over no treatment for maintenance of (typically corticosteroid-induced) remission. The AGA suggests using subcutaneous methotrexate for induction and maintenance of remission, but suggests against using oral methotrexate. The AGA suggests using combination therapy with infliximab and thiopurines over infliximab monotherapy, particularly in those naïve to thiopurines. The AGA also suggests using initial advanced therapy over step therapy involving corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators in patients with moderate-to-severely active CD. The panel also proposed key implementation considerations for optimal use of these medications, identified several knowledge gaps, and areas for future research. This guideline provides a comprehensive, patient-centered, evidence-based approach to the pharmacologic management of patients with moderate-to-severely active CD.",

In adult outpatients with moderate-to-severely active CD, the AGA suggests against using thiopurine monotherapy for induction of remission, but suggests using thiopurine monotherapy over no treatment for maintenance of (typically corticosteroid-induced) remission. The AGA suggests using subcutaneous methotrexate for induction and maintenance of remission, but suggests against using oral methotrexate. The AGA suggests using combination therapy with infliximab and thiopurines over infliximab monotherapy, particularly in those naïve to thiopurines. The AGA also suggests using initial advanced therapy over step therapy involving corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators in patients with moderate-to-severely active CD. The panel also proposed key implementation considerations for optimal use of these medications, identified several knowledge gaps, and areas for future research."

Whether adding revascularization to intensive medical management would provide greater benefit than intensive medical management alone is unclear. We conducted two parallel, observer-blinded clinical trials that enrolled patients with high-grade (≥70%) asymptomatic carotid stenosis across 155 centers in five countries. The stenting trial compared intensive medical management alone (medical-therapy group) with carotid-artery stenting plus intensive medical management (stenting group); the endarterectomy trial compared intensive medical management alone (medical-therapy group) with carotid endarterectomy plus intensive medical management (endarterectomy group). The primary outcome was a composite of any stroke or death, assessed from randomization to 44 days, or ipsilateral ischemic stroke, assessed during the remaining follow-up period up to 4 years. A total of 1245 patients underwent randomization in the stenting trial and 1240 in the endarterectomy trial. In the stenting trial, the 4-year incidence of primary-outcome events was 6.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.8 to 8.3) in the medical-therapy group and 2.8% (95% CI, 1.5 to 4.3) in the stenting group (P = 0.02 for the absolute difference). In the endarterectomy trial, the 4-year incidence of primary-outcome events was 5.3% (95% CI, 3.3 to 7.4) in the medical-therapy group and 3.7% (95% CI, 2.1 to 5.5) in the endarterectomy group (P = 0.24 for the absolute difference). From day 0 to 44, in the stenting trial, no strokes or deaths occurred in the medical-therapy group and seven strokes and one death occurred in the stenting group; in the endarterectomy trial, three strokes occurred in the medical-therapy group and nine strokes occurred in the endarterectomy group. Among patients with high-grade stenosis without recent symptoms, the addition of stenting led to a lower risk of a composite of perioperative stroke or death or ipsilateral stroke within 4 years than intensive medical management alone.

Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is a measure of skin barrier function with emerging utility in atopy and food allergy. To determine whether use of TEWL as a stopping criterion can prevent anaphylaxis during a peanut oral food challenge (OFC). This was a single-center randomized clinical trial of children aged 6 months to 5 years with a history of a clinical peanut allergic reaction and positive peanut skin prick and/or serum immunoglobulin E testing. All participants underwent peanut OFC at an allergy referral clinic. The study began May 1, 2023, and ended August 31, 2024. The intervention was stopping OFC based on a 1 g/m2/h rise in TEWL plus 1 objective allergic symptom observed by the physician during OFC. Standard OFC stopping criteria or the intervention criteria, whichever came first, were used in the intervention group. OFC stopping criteria from standard research were used in the control group. This was a single-intervention study. Rate of anaphylaxis, defined as a Consortium for Food Allergy Research (CoFAR) score of 2 or higher, compared between the intervention and control groups using 4 anaphylaxis criteria approaches: CoFAR, Brighton Collaboration, Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN), and World Allergy Organization (WAO). A total of 40 participants were included in the final analysis. The mean (SD) age of participants was 31.8 (16.18) months, with a median of 32.5 (range, 9-62) months; 23 (58%) were male. Using CoFAR criteria, among reactors, the anaphylaxis rate was 10 of 16 (63%; 95% CI, 39%-86%) in the intervention group compared with 14 of 14 (100%; 95% CI, 100%-100%) in the control group (P = .02).

There was no significant difference when comparing anaphylaxis rates using Brighton or FAAN criteria (eg, rate of 56% [95% CI, 32%-81%] vs 71% [95% CI, 48%-95%] in intervention vs control participants using Brighton criteria [P = .47]). The median CoFAR score in reactors in the intervention vs control groups was 1.8 (IQR, 1.0-2.0) vs 2.6 (IQR, 2.0-3.0) (P = .006). Eight of 16 participants (50%) in the intervention vs 12 of 14 (86%) in the control group required epinephrine (P = .06).

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing early initiation of long- or ultra-long-acting basal insulin plus IVII versus IVII alone in DKA management. Studies published up to 6 September 2025, were included. Meta-analysis was performed using mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes, both with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The primary outcome was time to DKA resolution. Secondary outcomes included total intravenous insulin use, rebound hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, length of hospital stay (LOS), and mortality. A one-stage individual participant data meta-analysis was also conducted when individual-level data were available. Eight RCTs including 468 participants (256 receiving early SC basal insulin plus IVII; 212 receiving IVII alone) were included. Baseline characteristics were comparable across studies. Early SC basal insulin significantly reduced time to DKA resolution (MD -4.02 h, 95%CI -5.52 to -2.52, p <0.001) and total intravenous insulin dose until DKA resolution (MD -19.2 units, 95%CI -28.99 to -9.26, p <0.001). No significant differences were observed between groups for rebound hyperglycemia, safety outcomes, LOS, or in-hospital mortality. Early SC basal insulin in combination with IVII significantly accelerates DKA resolution and reduces total IVII requirements, without increasing the risk of adverse events, including hypoglycemia or hypokalemia.",

To assess whether early administration of levosimendan reduces the time to successful VA-ECMO weaning in patients with severe but potentially reversible cardiogenic shock. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted across 11 intensive care units (ICUs) in France. Between August 27, 2021, and September 10, 2024, 205 adult patients with acute cardiogenic shock who had started VA-ECMO in the preceding 48 hours were enrolled. Final follow-up was completed on November 10, 2024. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive levosimendan, 0.15 μg/kg per minute, to be increased to 0.20 μg/kg per minute after 2 hours (n = 101), or placebo (n = 104). The primary outcome was time to successful ECMO weaning within 30 days following randomization. Secondary outcomes included ECMO-, mechanical ventilation-, and organ failure-free days, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, serious adverse events, and all-cause 30- and 60-day mortality. Among the 205 randomized patients (median age, 58 [IQR, 50-67] years; 149 [72.7%] male), main cardiogenic shock etiologies were postcardiotomy (79 [38.5%]), acute myocardial infarction (56 [27.3%]), and myocarditis (28 [13.7%]). Treatment dose was increased to 0.20 ± 0.01 μg/kg per minute in 93% of patients receiving levosimendan and in 96% of those receiving placebo. Within 30 days, 69 of 101 patients (68.3%) had a successful ECMO weaning in the levosimendan group compared with 71 of 104 (68.3%) in the placebo group (risk difference, 0.0% [95% CI, -12.8% to 12.7%]; subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.74-1.39]; P = .92).

      "abstract": "Tricuspid valve infective endocarditis (TVIE) is increasingly prevalent, especially among intravenous drug users. Surgical intervention is the standard treatment for severe cases, but percutaneous mechanical aspiration (PMA) has emerged as a less invasive alternative in high-risk patients. Comparative data on both strategies remain limited. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of PMA versus surgical management in patients with TVIE through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A comprehensive search of 5 databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus) through July 2025 identified studies comparing PMA and surgery for TVIE. Outcomes included all-cause mortality (30-day and 1-year), hospital length of stay, in-hospital mortality, and readmission for endocarditis. Risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) were pooled using a random-effects model. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I. Ten retrospective studies involving 6,035 patients were included (974 treated with PMA and 5,061 treated with surgery). The risk of in-hospital mortality was similar between PMA and surgery (RR = 1.07; p = 0.91). PMA was associated with a higher risk for 30-day mortality (RR = 2.71; 95% CI 1.53 to 4.82; p <0.001) but not for 1-year mortality (RR = 1.13; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.77; p = 0.60) or readmission for endocarditis (RR = 0.82; p = 0.63) compared with surgery. PMA was also associated with a shorter hospital stay (MD = -7.0 days; 95% CI -13.0 to -1.1; p = 0.03). The risk of bias was moderate to serious in all studies. In conclusion, the present systematic review of ten retrospective studies, surgical management of TVIE was associated with better short-term survival compared with PMA although the risks of 1-year mortality and readmission were similar. Randomized trials are required to better define the risk benefit profile of these approaches to TVIE.",

This study sought to compare the economic and quality of life outcomes of CABG vs PCI and determine their cost-effectiveness in the FAME (Fractional Flow Reserve vs Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation) 3 randomized trial. FAME 3 randomly assigned 1,500 patients with 3-vessel CAD to either CABG or fractional flow reserve-guided PCI using zotarolimus drug-eluting stents. We documented resource use and quality of life over 5 years of follow-up. We calculated costs by applying Medicare reimbursement rates to resources used, assessed quality of life using the EuroQOL EQ-5D, calculated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from EQ-5D utility values, and used multivariable regression to compare outcomes by treatment assignment. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio based on 5-year outcomes and also on projected life expectancies, and assessed its variability in 10,000 bootstrap replications. Cumulative costs over 5 years were 30% higher in patients assigned to CABG (95% CI: 16%-46%; P < 0.001). QALYs over 5 years did not differ significantly between the PCI (4.05 ± 0.84) and CABG groups (4.03 ± 0.82), although EQ-5D scores improved more rapidly after PCI. Patients <65 years of age at enrollment assigned to PCI were more likely to be employed at 5 years (56% vs 47%; P = 0.025). PCI had greater economic value than CABG over 5 years, with lower costs and higher QALYs in 66% of replications, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for CABG above the $150,000/QALY benchmark in 98% of bootstrap replications. These findings were essentially unchanged in several lifetime projections based on the outcomes documented within the trial follow-up period. Fractional flow reserve-guided PCI using zotarolimus drug-eluting stents provides significantly better long-term value than CABG for treatment of patients with multivessel CAD, with equivalent clinical outcomes at substantially lower cost.",

      "abstract": "People with cardiovascular disease are at risk of recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events, and chronic low-grade inflammation may be a major underlying factor. Treatment with low-dose colchicine has been proposed for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in individuals at high cardiovascular risk. A previous Cochrane review showed considerable uncertainty regarding the benefits and harms of this approach. To evaluate the benefits and harms of low-dose colchicine in the prevention of cardiovascular events in adults with a history of stable CVD or following myocardial infarction or stroke. We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature until February 2025 using Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the drugs@FDA database, references of key papers, and references of included studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of low-dose colchicine for a minimum of six months versus any control intervention in patients of any age with cardiovascular disease (i.e. history of stable cardiovascular disease, previous myocardial infarction or stroke). Our critical outcomes were all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and serious adverse events. Our important outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, stroke, all-cause hospitalisations, coronary revascularisation (percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)/angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)), quality of life, and gastrointestinal adverse events (i.e. diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, or vomiting). Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB2 tool. We conducted meta-analyses using the random-effects model. We generated forest plots to facilitate visualisation of the data. We did not perform any subgroup analysis. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for all critical outcomes and for cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and coronary revascularisation. This was carried out by two review authors working independently. We included 12 studies involving 22,983 randomised participants. The follow-up in the studies ranged from 6 to 80 months. Overall, 11,524 participants were assigned to low-dose colchicine treatment and 11,459 were assigned to a control intervention, which constituted either usual care plus placebo or usual care only. The doses of colchicine used were 0.5 mg once or twice daily. At baseline, the mean age of participants ranged from 57 to 74 years. Most participants (79.4%) were male. There is high-certainty evidence that low-dose colchicine treatment reduces the risk of myocardial infarction, with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.96; 22,153 participants, 8 studies; I = 51%), yielding an absolute risk reduction of 9 fewer events (95% CI 16 fewer to 2 fewer) per 1000 patients, when the myocardial infarction rate is about 4% (36 events per 1000 patients) in the control group. There is also high-certainty evidence that low-dose colchicine reduces the risk of stroke with a RR of 0.67 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.95; 22,483 participants, 10 studies; I = 40%), yielding an absolute risk reduction of 8 fewer events (95% CI 12 fewer to 1 fewer) per 1000 patients, when the stroke rate is about 2% (22 events per 1000 patients) in the control group. There is high-certainty evidence that the use of low-dose colchicine does not increase the rate of serious adverse events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.02; 15,677 participants, 4 studies; I = 0%). However, gastrointestinal adverse events were more common under treatment with colchicine (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.57; 22,185 participants, 10 studies; I = 91%). For all other outcomes assessed, the evidence is of moderate certainty. Colchicine probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.21; 22,747 participants, 10 studies; I = 1%; moderate-certainty evidence), in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.22; 22,271 participants; 8 studies; I = 13%; moderate-certainty evidence), and coronary revascularisation (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.08; 13,705 participants, 5 studies; I = 40%; moderate-certainty evidence). There is no evidence about the benefits or harms of colchicine on quality-of-life or on the risk of all-cause hospitalisation. People with cardiovascular disease using low-dose colchicine as secondary prevention for at least six months benefit from reduced rates of myocardial infarction and stroke, without an increase in serious adverse events. Moderate-certainty evidence did not show a benefit from low-dose colchicine for the risk of mortality (i.e. all-cause and cardiovascular mortality) or coronary revascularisation rates. Colchicine use was associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse events, which were typically described as mild and transient in nature. Additional studies are warranted to investigate the benefits and harms of low-dose colchicine in relevant subgroups and in specific indications, such as long-term use in individuals with stable coronary artery disease versus limited-time use following acute coronary syndrome.

In the phase 3 ATTRibute-CM (Efficacy and Safety of Acoramidis in Participants with Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy) study, acoramidis significantly reduced the composite of all-cause mortality or first CV-related hospitalization (CVH), with an effect observed at month 3. Its efficacy on the burden of cumulative CV outcome events has not been reported. This study was a post hoc exploratory recurrent-event analysis of the efficacy of acoramidis on the cumulative incidence of CV outcomes from ATTRibute-CM and its open-label extension. Cumulative incidences of centrally adjudicated CV-related mortality (CVM) or recurrent CVH (first and, if applicable, subsequent CVH), recurrent CVH alone (month 30), and CVM (month 42) were measured in the modified intention-to-treat population (acoramidis, n = 409; placebo, n = 202). Mean cumulative events by treatment, and the difference between treatment groups were estimated by using a modified Andersen-Gill model. Acoramidis significantly reduced the cumulative risk of CVM or recurrent CVH through month 30 vs placebo (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.43-0.62; P < 0.0001). A notable proportion of CV outcome events (19% of CVM or recurrent CVH events, 22% of CVH) occurred within the first 6 months. Numerically fewer cumulative events were observed with acoramidis compared with placebo at month 1, and the difference increased progressively, resulting at month 30 in 53 events avoided per 100 treated participants (95% CI: 29-79). At month 42, CVM was reduced with continuous acoramidis vs placebo-to-acoramidis (HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.39-0.79; P = 0.0011). The annualized frequency of recurrent CVH was significantly decreased through month 30 (relative risk ratio: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.35-0.69; P < 0.0001). Acoramidis significantly reduced the cumulative burden of CV outcomes in ATTR-CM over 30 months. Numerically fewer events were observed with acoramidis vs placebo by month 1, and the difference increased progressively over time, resulting in 53 events avoided per 100 treated patients at month 30.

      "abstract": "Influenza-related complications occur frequently in persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Limited data exist on the effectiveness of high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (HD-IIV) in persons with CKD. The purpose of this study was to assess the relative effectiveness (rVE) of HD-IIV vs standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV) against severe clinical outcomes in persons with CKD from the elderly general population. DANFLU-2 (A Pragmatic Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Effectiveness of High-Dose Influenza Vaccine vs. Standard-Dose Influenza Vaccine in Older Adults) was a pragmatic, open-label, individually randomized trial conducted in Denmark during the 2022-2023, 2023-2024, and 2024-2025 influenza seasons with the aim of assessing the rVE of HD-IIV vs SD-IIV in an older adult general population. In this prespecified secondary analysis, we assessed the rVE against severe clinical outcomes according to the presence of CKD. CKD was defined using data from laboratory registries and International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision diagnosis codes 10 years before vaccination. Among 332,438 DANFLU-2 participants (mean age 73.7 ± 5.8 years; 48.6% women), 46,788 (14.1%) had CKD at baseline. The effect of HD-IIV vs SD-IIV on hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia differed by CKD status: rVE was 16.9% (95% CI: 3.4%-28.5%) in participants with CKD vs 0.6% (95% CI: -9.6% to 9.9%) in those without CKD (P interaction = 0.046). Absolute risks for hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia were 1.7% with SD-IIV vs 1.3% with HD-IIV in CKD, corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of -0.29% (95% CI: -0.50% to 0.058%; number needed to treat [NNT] = 359). For influenza hospitalizations specifically, the benefit of HD-IIV was also substantially greater in CKD: rVE 68.6% (95% CI: 46.7%-82.3%; NNT = 561) vs 30.6% (95% CI: 7.2%-48.2%; NNT =3,953) in non-CKD (P interaction = 0.0079). Reductions in hospitalizations for cardiorespiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and laboratory-confirmed influenza were consistent regardless of CKD (all P interaction > 0.05). In this prespecified analysis of DANFLU-2, including the largest CKD population ever in an individually randomized vaccine trial, we observed a benefit of HD-IIV vs SD-IIV against hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia, as well as hospitalization for influenza, with suggestion of a greater relative benefit among those with CKD. Furthermore, the beneficial effect of HD-IIV vs SD-IIV on multiple cardiorespiratory outcomes was consistent across participants irrespective of CKD status.",
