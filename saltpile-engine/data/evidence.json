      "abstract": "We aimed to quantify the blood pressure-lowering efficacy of antihypertensive drugs and their combinations from the five major drug classes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving adult participants randomly assigned to receive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, β blockers, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics. Eligibility criteria included follow-up duration between 4 weeks and 26 weeks, antihypertensive drug treatment fixed in all participants for at least 4 weeks before follow-up blood pressure assessment; and availability of clinic blood pressure for the calculation of mean difference in systolic blood pressure between treatment groups. Crossover trials with less than 2 weeks' washout between the crossover periods were excluded. Eligible studies published between database inception and Dec 31, 2022 were identified from searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Epistemonikos; searches were updated to include studies published between Jan 1, 2023, and Feb 28, 2025. The primary outcome was placebo-corrected reduction in systolic blood pressure. Blood pressure-lowering efficacy was estimated using fixed-effects meta-analyses standardised to mean baseline blood pressure across included trials. Drug regimens were categorised into low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to systolic blood pressure-lowering efficacy of <10 mm Hg, 10-19 mm Hg, and ≥20 mm Hg, respectively, from a baseline of 154 mm Hg. A model was developed to calculate efficacy for any combination of antihypertensives and validated on external trials of dual and triple combination antihypertensives. The study protocol was registered on the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY202410036). We analysed 484 trials including 104 176 participants (mean age 54 years [SD 8], 57 422 [55%] men, 46 754 [45%] women, and mean baseline systolic blood pressure 154/100 mm Hg). Mean follow-up duration was 8·6 weeks (SD 5·2). On average, monotherapy at standard dose reduced systolic blood pressure by 8·7 mm Hg (95% CI 8·2-9·2), and each doubling in dose conferred an additional 1·5 mm Hg (1·2-1·7) reduction. Dual combinations at one standard dose conferred a 14·9 mm Hg (95% CI 13·1-16·8) reduction in systolic blood pressure, with each doubling of doses of both drugs conferring an additional reduction of 2·5 mm Hg (1·4-3·7). Each 10 mm Hg decrease in baseline systolic blood pressure reduced pressure-lowering efficacy by 1·3 mm Hg (1·0-1·5) for monotherapies, although differences between drug classes were observed. Among 57 monotherapies at standard dose, 45 (79%) were classified as low intensity. Of 189 different drug-dose dual combinations, 110 (58%) were classified as moderate intensity, and 21 (11%) as high intensity. There were considerable differences in dose-response and baseline blood pressure-response relationships between and within drug classes. The efficacy model showed a high correlation between predicted and observed systolic blood pressures when validated on external trials (r=0·76, p<0·0001). These analyses provide robust estimates of the expected blood pressure-lowering effect for any combination of antihypertensive drugs, allowing their efficacy to be classified into low, moderate, and high intensity.

Although MBC has been associated with improved outcomes in major depressive disorder (MDD), its effectiveness in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains understudied. To assess whether MBC accelerates the resolution of depressive symptoms compared with standard care among adults with MDD in Pakistan. This multicenter, assessor-blinded, parallel-arm randomized clinical trial was conducted in Pakistan from September 2022 to January 2024, with 24 weeks of follow-up. Adults diagnosed with nonpsychotic MDD were recruited from psychiatric hospitals and primary care centers in 7 Pakistani cities (Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Hyderabad, Peshawar, Multan, and Quetta). Participants were randomized 1:1 to MBC or standard care. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted. By design, pharmacotherapy was limited to paroxetine or mirtazapine in both MBC or standard care groups. The MBC group completed the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report and the Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Rating Scale at each visit (baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24). Scores from these instruments informed antidepressant dose adjustments or switch. The standard care group received treatment based on clinician judgment and did not undergo repeated clinical measurements. Primary outcomes were time to response (defined as ≥50% reduction in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HDRS-17]; range: 0-52, with the highest score indicating severe depression) and time to remission (defined as HDRS-17 score of ≤7) within the 24-week follow-up period. Secondary outcomes included changes in HDRS-17 scores and rates of adverse effects or treatment discontinuation. A total of 154 adults (mean [SD] age, 34.5 [10.5] years; 105 females [68.2%]) were randomized. Median (IQR) time to response was faster with MBC than with standard care (2 [2-4] weeks vs 4 [2-12] weeks); similarly, median (IQR) time to remission was faster for MBC vs standard care (4 [4-8] weeks vs 8 weeks [2 weeks to no remission] weeks). At week 24, there were no significant differences in rates of response or remission between groups. After week 24, reduction in mean HDRS-17 scores was significantly but modestly greater in the MBC group than in the standard care group (-18.1 [95% CI, 16.4-19.6] points vs -17.0 [95% CI, 15.6-18.5] points; t129 = 0.71; P < .001). No differences were observed in other secondary outcomes. This trial of adults with MDD found that MBC led to faster time to response and time to remission than standard care in low-resource settings. Future studies need to confirm the clinical effectiveness of MBC and assess its cost-effectiveness in LMICs. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05431374.",

Existing interventions have shown limited effect. To assess the effect of the once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist semaglutide in SGA-treated adults (aged 18-60 years) with schizophrenia, prediabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], 5.7%-6.4% of total hemoglobin) (to convert HbA1c from percentage of total hemoglobin to mmol/mol, use the following formula: (HbA1c % - 2.152)/0.09148), and overweight or obesity (body mass index [BMI], calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, ≥27). This placebo-controlled, double-blinded randomized clinical trial was conducted from January 2022 to May 2024, with 30 weeks of follow-up, among regional community-based mental health services in 2 regions of Denmark (Region of Southern Denmark and Region of Zealand). SGA-treated patients with schizophrenia, prediabetes, and overweight or obesity were randomized to semaglutide or placebo. Data analysis was completed from May 2024 to January 2025. Once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide or placebo for 30 weeks; semaglutide was titrated up to 1.0 mg/week over 8 weeks. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c. Secondary end points included changes in body weight, schizophrenia symptoms based on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 6 (PANSS-6) score, and physical and mental quality of life (QoL) (assessed via the 36-item Short Form Survey, version 2 [SF-36v2]). A total of 154 patients were recruited and randomized 1:1 to semaglutide or placebo (87 female participants (56.5%); mean [SD] age, 38.3 [10.7] years). Of 154 randomized patients, 141 (91.5%) completed the trial-74 of 77 patients randomized to semaglutide (96%) and 67 of 77 randomized to placebo (87%). Semaglutide reduced HbA1c by 0.46% of total hemoglobin (95% CI, -0.56% to -0.36%) and body weight by 9.21 kg (95% CI, -11.68 to -6.75). An HbA1c less than 5.7% of total hemoglobin was achieved in 81% vs 19% of patients treated with semaglutide and placebo, respectively (P < .001); improvements in high-density cholesterol by 10.81 mg/dL (95% CI, 2.70-18.53; P = .007) and triglycerides by -29.20 mg/dL (95% CI, -55.75 to 2.65; P = .03) (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0113) were also observed. Finally, semaglutide improved physical QoL by 3.75 points on the SF-36v2 (95% CI, 1.52-5.98; P = .001) but had no significant effect on mental QoL scores or PANSS-6 score. Gastrointestinal symptoms were more frequent in semaglutide-treated patients. A few semaglutide-treated patients were hospitalized more frequently than observed in the placebo-treated group, but the number of serious adverse effects did not differ between groups. In this multicenter, double-blinded randomized clinical trial, 30 weeks of administration of semaglutide, up to 1.0 mg/week, was safe, lowered blood glucose (as measured by HbA1c) and weight, and improved physical QoL in SGA-treated patients with schizophrenia, prediabetes, and obesity without worsening mental health.

      "abstract": "The appropriate antithrombotic regimen for patients with chronic coronary syndrome who are at high atherothrombotic risk and receiving long-term oral anticoagulation remains unknown. We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in France involving patients with chronic coronary syndrome who had undergone a previous stent implantation (>6 months before enrollment) and were at high atherothrombotic risk and currently receiving long-term oral anticoagulation. The patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive aspirin (100 mg once daily) or placebo; all the patients continued to receive their current oral anticoagulation therapy. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, systemic embolism, coronary revascularization, or acute limb ischemia. The key safety outcome was major bleeding. A total of 872 patients underwent randomization; 433 were assigned to the aspirin group, and 439 to the placebo group. The trial was stopped early at the advice of the independent data and safety monitoring board after a median follow-up of 2.2 years because of an excess of deaths from any cause in the aspirin group. A primary efficacy outcome event occurred in 73 patients (16.9%) in the aspirin group and in 53 patients (12.1%) in the placebo group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07 to 2.18; P = 0.02). Death from any cause occurred in 58 patients (13.4%) in the aspirin group and in 37 (8.4%) in the placebo group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.14 to 2.58; P = 0.01).

This study was conducted as a prospective, randomized, single-center, superiority trial with a 1:1 parallel-group allocation.

Baseline characteristics, including initial respiratory rates-34 (IQR, 30-38) breaths/min in the HFNC group and 33.5 (IQR, 30-37) in the NIV group-were similar between groups. In both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, the change in respiratory rate at 120 min was similar across groups. No significant differences were observed in respiratory rates or their changes at 30, 60, and 120 min.

We conducted a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in Brazil involving patients with acute coronary syndromes who had undergone successful PCI. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio within the first 4 days of hospitalization to stop treatment with aspirin and receive potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (ticagrelor or prasugrel) or to receive dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and a potent P2Y12 inhibitor) for 12 months. The two ranked primary outcomes, assessed through 12 months, were a composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or urgent target-vessel revascularization (tested for noninferiority, with a noninferiority margin of 2.5 percentage points) and major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (tested for superiority). A total of 3410 patients were included in the intention-to-treat population (1712 in the monotherapy group and 1698 in the dual antiplatelet therapy group). At 12 months, death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or urgent revascularization had occurred in 119 patients (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 7.0%) in the monotherapy group and in 93 patients (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 5.5%) in the dual antiplatelet therapy group (absolute risk difference, 1.47 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.16 to 3.10; P = 0.11 for noninferiority).

An assessment of a strategy of actively increasing plasma potassium levels to the high-normal range is needed.

Participants were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to a treatment regimen aimed at increasing the plasma potassium level to a high-normal level (4.5 to 5.0 mmol per liter) by means of potassium supplementation, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, or both plus dietary guidance and standard care (high-normal potassium group) or to standard care only (standard-care group).

      "abstract": "Approved spinal muscular atrophy therapies greatly improve clinical outcomes; however, substantial motor function deficits persist. Apitegromab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, selectively inhibits myostatin activation, improving muscle function. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of apitegromab in patients with nonambulatory type 2 or type 3 spinal muscular atrophy receiving nusinersen or risdiplam. SAPPHIRE, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, was done in 48 hospitals in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA. Eligible participants were aged 2-21 years, had genetically documented SMN-deficient nonambulatory type 2 or type 3 spinal muscular atrophy, an estimated life expectancy greater than 2 years, Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expanded (HFMSE) scores 10-45, and had received at least 10 months' nusinersen or at least 6 months' risdiplam therapy at screening. Participants aged 2-12 years were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive apitegromab 20 mg/kg, apitegromab 10 mg/kg, or placebo every 4 weeks; participants aged 13-21 years were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive apitegromab 20 mg/kg or placebo every 4 weeks. All participants, parents or caregivers, investigators, and site personnel were unaware of the treatment assignment. The primary endpoint, change from baseline in HFMSE at 12 months, was assessed in participants aged 2-12 years who received at least one dose of apitegromab or placebo and had at least one post-baseline evaluable HFMSE assessment (modified intention-to-treat set). Comparisons of the combined apitegromab dose (20 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) versus placebo and the 20 mg/kg dose versus placebo were done with a mixed-effects model with repeated measurement. Safety was analysed in all participants who received at least one dose of apitegromab or placebo through evaluation of adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs and cardiac assessments, laboratory evaluations, and concomitant medications. SAPPHIRE is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05156320, and is completed. From March 28, 2022, to Sept 4, 2024, we enrolled 188 patients (156 in the population aged 2-12 years and 32 in the population aged 13-21 years); of whom 128 participants received apitegromab and 60 participants received placebo. At 12 months, least squares mean difference in HFMSE change from baseline was 1·8 (95% CI 0·30 to 3·32, p=0·019) points for participants aged 2-12 years receiving apitegromab versus placebo (least squares mean 0·6 vs -1·2). Least squares mean difference in HFMSE change from baseline was 1·4 (95% CI -0·34 to 3·13; p=0·11) for apitegromab 20 mg/kg versus placebo (least squares mean 0·2 vs -1·2). The incidence and severity of adverse events were similar between apitegromab and placebo, and consistent with spinal muscular atrophy and background spinal muscular atrophy therapy. The most frequently reported adverse events were pyrexia (apitegromab, 33 [26%] of 128 vs placebo, 17 [28%] of 60), nasopharyngitis (32 [25%] vs 14 [23%]), cough (30 [23%] vs 12 [20%]), vomiting (29 [23%] vs ten [17%]), upper respiratory tract infection (28 [22%] vs 18 [30%]), and headache (27 [21%] vs 12 [20%]). No patients discontinued due to adverse events. Participants in the apitegromab treatment groups (combined 20 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose) achieved statistically significant improvements in motor function compared with placebo; however, the least squares mean difference was not significant between apitegromab 20 mg/kg and placebo. Overall, SAPPHIRE results build on findings from the phase 2 TOPAZ trial, showing improved motor function with a generally well tolerated safety profile, supporting the use of muscle-targeting therapy for spinal muscular atrophy.

      "abstract": "Although intensive blood pressure control is recommended by major guidelines, its overall benefit-harm balance remains uncertain. In particular, it is unclear how net clinical benefit varies by blood pressure target and patient characteristics. We aimed to quantify the benefit-harm trade-offs of intensive blood pressure control versus standard blood pressure control. We conducted a post-hoc, pooled participant-level analysis of six randomised controlled trials (ACCORD BP, SPRINT, ESPRIT, BPROAD, STEP, and CRHCP). Trial selection was based on our collaborative framework, the Blood Pressure Reduction Union-Landmark Evidence, and a targeted literature search, guided by five predefined inclusion criteria: (1) comparison of intensive systolic blood pressure targets (<120 mm Hg or <130 mm Hg) versus standard treatment; (2) reporting of composite major cardiovascular outcomes; (3) enrolment of more than 2000 participants; (4) standardised reporting of treatment-related adverse events; and (5) availability of individual participant data. We also conducted a systematic review in which we searched PubMed for studies published from database inception up to June 15, 2025, with no language restrictions. We used search terms related to cardiovascular outcomes, hypertension, intensive blood pressure lowering, and randomised trials. Study screening and data extraction were independently conducted in pairs by ten reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by discussion or adjudication. Participants in the six trials were randomly assigned to intensive blood pressure treatment (systolic blood pressure target <120 mm Hg or <130 mm Hg) versus standard treatment (systolic blood pressure target <140 mm Hg, <150 mm Hg in older adults, or usual care), depending on the trial design. The primary benefit outcome was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. The primary harm outcomes were adverse events of interest (eg, hypotension and syncope) and renal-related events. Statistical analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis using Bayesian hierarchical models. The initial dataset included 80 676 participants, of whom 80 220 were included in our analyses (intensive blood pressure control group n=40 503; standard blood pressure control group n=39 717). The median age was 64·0 years (IQR 59·0-70·0), 39 043 (48·7%) participants were male, and 41 177 (51·3%) were female. Most participants were Asian (66 290 [82·6%]) or White (8097 [10·1%]). During a median follow-up of 3·2 years (IQR 3·0-3·5), the composite cardiovascular disease outcome occurred in 2158 (5·3%) participants in the intensive blood pressure control group and 2811 (7·1%) participants in the standard blood pressure control group (hazard ratio 0·76, 95% credible interval [CrI] 0·72-0·81; p<0·0001). Compared with standard blood pressure control, intensive blood pressure control was associated with a 1·73% absolute risk reduction (95% CrI 1·65-1·81) in cardiovascular disease (number needed to treat 58 [95% CrI 55-61]) and a 1·82% absolute risk increase (95% CrI 1·63-2·01) for adverse events of interest (number needed to harm 55 [95% CrI 49-61]). Overall, intensive blood pressure control showed a favourable benefit-harm profile, with a net benefit of 1·14 (95% CrI 1·03-1·25), using adjudicated weighting. The net benefit remained positive when considering kidney-related adverse events (1·13 [95% CrI 1·01-1·24]). Compared with standard blood pressure control, intensive blood pressure control provides a net benefit between the reduction in cardiovascular events and the increase in adverse events, including renal events.

We conducted a pragmatic, registry-based, open-label, randomized, active-controlled trial to evaluate the relative effectiveness of high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine, as compared with the standard dose, against severe clinical outcomes among community-dwelling adults 65 to 79 years of age. The trial was performed during two influenza seasons (2023-2024 and 2024-2025) with regional health registry data in Galicia, Spain. In each influenza season, the participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine or the standard dose. The primary end point was a composite of hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia from 14 days after vaccination to May 31 of the following year. A total of 103,169 unique participants underwent randomization; 31,307 participants were enrolled in both seasons and were counted for each. During the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 seasons, 59,490 and 74,986 participants, respectively, underwent randomization. Among the participants, the mean (±SD) age was 72.3±4.3 years, and 53.6% were men.

Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was observed in 14 of 294 patients (4.8%) in the apixaban group and in 5 of 294 patients (1.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.68; 95% CI, 0.96 to 7.43; P = 0.06). One patient in the apixaban group and 3 patients in the placebo group died, with no deaths attributed to cardiovascular or hemorrhagic causes. Nonhemorrhagic, nonfatal adverse events occurred in 6 patients (2.0%) in each group."

      "abstract": "Tuberculous meningitis is the most severe form of tuberculosis, causing death or disability in around half of those affected. There are no up-to-date international guidelines defining its optimal management. Therefore, the Tuberculous Meningitis International Research Consortium conducted a systematic review of available evidence to address key management questions and to develop practice guidance. The consortium includes representatives from India, Indonesia, South Africa, Uganda, Viet Nam, Australia, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA. Questions were developed using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) format for tuberculous meningitis diagnosis, anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy, adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy, and neurocritical and neurosurgical care. A Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach was used to assess the certainty (or quality) of evidence and establish the direction and strength of recommendations for each PICO-based question. We provide evidence-based recommendations for the optimal treatment and diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis, alongside expert opinion. We expose substantial knowledge and evidence gaps, thereby highlighting current research priorities.",

This was an observational extension of the myPACE randomized clinical trial with up to 4 years of follow-up in 100 patients with stage B or C HFpEF and preexisting physiologic pacemakers treated at the University of Vermont Medical Center. The myPACE study was conducted from June 2019 to December 2021; follow-up for this report was concluded in June 2023. Participants in the original myPACE trial were randomly assigned to either personalized accelerated pacing (myPACE) or 60 bpm (usual care). The primary outcome was the accrual of first and recurrent adverse clinical events during the open-label follow-up phase-including urgent visits or hospitalizations for heart failure or atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, stroke, or death-assessed using an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and a prespecified per-protocol (PP) analysis of patients who continued their assigned treatment. Secondary outcomes included event-free survival in both ITT and PP analyses. Among the 100 original trial participants (48 in myPACE and 52 in usual care), the ITT analysis demonstrated a trend toward slower event accrual with the myPACE intervention (15 vs 33 events; Lin-Wei-Ying-Yang estimate [LWYY], 0.48; 95% CI, 0.22-1.06; P = .07) and longer event-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.31-1.29; P = .20) but did not reach statistical significance. In the prespecified PP analysis, 87 remained on their assigned heart rate setting over the 4-year follow-up (39 in myPACE and 48 in usual care). The mean (SD) age was 74 (10) years, and 48 participants (55%) were male. In this PP analysis, myPACE was associated with a slower accrual of clinical events (5 vs 31 events; LWYY, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.04-0.67; P = .01) and longer event-free survival (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11-0.80; P = .02) compared to usual care. These results were primarily driven by heart failure-related events.

      "abstract": "Anti-malarial artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) might be losing efficacy in east Africa, with the spread of artemisinin partial resistance and reduced partner drug activity. Our trial aimed to measure the efficacies of artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate-amodiaquine, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, and artesunate-pyronaridine in three sites in Uganda. This randomised, open-label, phase 4 clinical trial was carried out at three sites in the Agago, Arua, and Busia districts of Uganda. Children aged 6 months to 10 years with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were randomly assigned to receive either artemether-lumefantrine (20 mg artemether; 120 mg lumefantrine; twice a day for 3 days) in all sites or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (40 mg dihydroartemisinin and 320 mg piperaquine, once a day for 3 days) in Agago, artesunate-amodiaquine (25 mg artesunate and 67·5 mg amodiaquine for children <9 kg or 50 mg artesunate and 135 mg amodiaquine for children ≥9 kg, once a day for 3 days) in Busia; and artesunate-pyronaridine (60 mg artesunate and 180 mg pyronaridine for children >15 kg or 20 mg artesunate and 60 mg pyronaridine for children <15 kg, once a day for 3 days) in Arua, with follow-up to 42 days. Participants were not blinded to group assignments; however, investigators and those assessing outcome were masked. The primary outcome was parasitaemia, assessed by microscopy, either uncorrected or PCR-corrected to distinguish recrudescence from new infection. All participants who received the treatment per protocol and were not lost to follow-up were included in the primary outcome. All participants who were randomly allocated to treatment groups were included in the safety analyses. This study is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, number PACTR202301796134887, and is complete. Between Nov 7, 2022, and March 24, 2023, 808 participants (437 [54%] female) were enrolled and assigned to treatment groups; 15 (2%) were lost to follow-up and 793 (98%) completed follow-up. The uncorrected adequate clinical and parasitological response for artemether-lumefantrine was 87 (51·8%; 95% CI 44·0-59·5) of 168 participants in Arua, 88 (51·8%; 44·0-59·4) of 170 and Busia, and 131 (79·4%; 72·3-85·1) of 165 in Agago. This response for artemether-lumefantrine was lower than that of the other ACTs at all sites: 97 (98·0%; 92·2-99·6) of 99 for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in Agago, 95 (99·0%; 93·5-99·9) of 96 for artesunate-amodiaquine in Busia, and 73 (73·7%; 63·8-81·8) of 99 for artesunate-pyronaridine in Arua. PCR-corrected 28-day efficacies were 88 (81·5%; 72·6-88·1) of 108 for artemether-lumefantrine and 95 (100%; 95·2-100·0) of 95 for artesunate-amodiaquine in Busia; 131 (97·0%; 92·1-99·0) of 135 for artemether-lumefantrine and 97 (100%; 95·3-100·0) of 97 for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in Agago; and 87 (82·1%; 73·2-88·6) of 106 for artemether-lumefantrine and 73 (92·4%; 83·6-96·9) of 79 for artesunate-pyronaridine in Arua. All regimens were well tolerated. The most common adverse events were upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhoea, and anaemia.

Participants were not blinded to group assignments; however, investigators and those assessing outcome were masked. The primary outcome was parasitaemia, assessed by microscopy, either uncorrected or PCR-corrected to distinguish recrudescence from new infection. All participants who received the treatment per protocol and were not lost to follow-up were included in the primary outcome. All participants who were randomly allocated to treatment groups were included in the safety analyses.

To determine long-term outcomes in patients randomized to functional (stress) vs anatomic (coronary computed tomographic angiography [CTA]) initial testing. This study is a 2025 follow-up analysis of mortality of participants in the PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) randomized clinical trial, which was conducted from 2009 to 2014, using a 2024 National Death Index search. Median (IQR) follow-up duration was 10.6 (9.9-11.3) years; maximum follow-up was 12.4 years. PROMISE was conducted at 193 multispecialty outpatient sites in North America among 10 003 symptomatic patients requiring testing for suspected CAD. Data analysis was conducted from August 2024 to March 2025. Participants were randomized 1:1 to initial CTA or stress testing. Testing and subsequent care were performed by sites according to usual practices. The PROMISE trial's original primary end point was death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina hospitalization, or major procedural complication. The primary end point for extended follow-up was all-cause death, with cardiovascular (CV) death as a secondary end point. At enrollment, mean (SD) participant age was 61 (8) years, 5270 participants (52.7%) were women, and 8762 (87.6%) had chest pain or dyspnea. Death occurred in 1128 participants (14.4%), including 558 (14.3%) in the CTA arm and 570 (14.5%) in the stress arm (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.87-1.10). There was no demonstrable difference in cardiovascular mortality, although the point estimate favored CTA (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67-1.05; adjusted HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.41-1.94). There were no significant interactions between all-cause death or CV death and study arm by age (<60 or ≥60 years) (P value for interaction = .19), gender (P value for interaction = .60), or race and ethnicity (P value for interaction = .47). A CTA indicating any degree of abnormality, including mild (nonobstructive CAD), moderate, and severe findings, conferred elevated adjusted HRs of death (1.99-3.44; all P < .001) compared to normal study results. Among stress testing results, only a severe abnormality was prognostically significant (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.10-1.91). In landmark analyses of those alive at 90 days, there were no interactions between randomized testing and use of statins (P value for interaction = .22), β-blockers (P value for interaction = .76), or antiplatelet agents (P value for interaction = .49). In long-term follow-up of the PROMISE randomized clinical trial, initial noninvasive test selection in patients with stable symptoms of suspected CAD did not affect all-cause or CV mortality at 10 years.

However, the evidence for this recommendation has not been reassessed recently. To determine whether current evidence continues to support the recommended 5 to 7 days of antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Searches were performed of the Embase, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL databases for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) from inception to September 25, 2024. The search query included the keywords gastrointestinal bleeding and prophylactic antibiotics. Included RCTs compared longer durations of antibiotic prophylaxis to shorter durations (or 0 days) in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Observational and pediatric studies, gray literature, comparisons of systemic antibiotics, studies not reporting mortality or early rebleed, and studies of nonsystemic antibiotics were excluded. Data were extracted in duplicate by independent reviewers. Study quality was assessed in duplicate using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. Data were pooled by random-effects bayesian meta-analyses using a noninformative prior for the effect and a weakly informative prior for heterogeneity. To account for therapeutic advancements, a post hoc subgroup analysis was performed for studies published after 2004. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality with a prespecified 5% noninferiority margin on the risk difference (RD) scale. Early rebleed and bacterial infections were secondary outcomes. The analysis included 14 RCTs totaling 1322 participants (mean age range, 41.5 to 62.0 years; 981 male [74.2%] individuals), of whom 1202 (90.9%) had a variceal source of bleeding. Study quality was low to moderate, bacterial infections were heterogeneously defined, and no studies reported adverse events. Two RCTs compared longer (5-7 days) to shorter (2-3 days) durations and 12 RCTs compared any prophylaxis (1-10 days) to none. Shorter durations (including none) had a 97.3% probability of noninferiority for all-cause mortality (RD, 0.9%; 95% credible interval [95% CrI],  -2.6 to 4.9). Shorter durations had a 73.8% probability of noninferiority for early rebleeding (RD, 2.9%; 95% CrI, -4.2 to 10.0) but were associated with more study-defined bacterial infections (RD, 15.2%; 95% CrI, 5.0 to 25.9). The probabilities of noninferiority of shorter durations for all 3 outcomes were higher in studies published after 2004. The findings of this systematic review and bayesian meta-analysis do not support the purported mortality benefit driving guideline recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with cirrhosis and upper gastrointestinal bleeds. Although prophylaxis reduced reported infections, methodological concerns regarding infection definitions introduced high risk of bias. Higher-quality RCTs are needed to determine the benefit and optimal duration of antibiotic prophylaxis in the modern era of advanced interventions. Until these studies are available, clinicians should be aware that the current guideline recommendations are not based on high-quality evidence.",

      "abstract": "While autistic individuals are 4 times more likely to have depression compared to non-autistic individuals, depression remained largely undetected in this group resulting in significant unmet needs. A systematic literature review was conducted to determine the psychometric properties of measuring tools for depressive symptoms in autistic children and adolescents. The review followed the PRISMA 2020 guideline (PROSPERO: CRD42023423377) based on the search of several databases from 1980 until November 2024. The COnsensus-based Standards for the Selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist was used to assess for each tool: internal consistency, reliability, measurement error, content validity, structural validity, hypothesis testing, criterion validity, responsiveness to change and cross-cultural validity. The review found 15 empirical studies evaluating the properties of twelve measuring tools for depression in autistic youths. The validities of standards screening scales were low, but better for questionnaires with items focusing on behavioral aspects of depression, i.e., the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The evidence supporting the quality of the instrument was much better for those developed for subjects with neurodevelopmental divergences, such as The Evaluation of Depressive symptoms in Autism (EDA), with five domains of psychometric properties rated as strong or moderate. To determine the optimal approach for the use of consensual instruments, further research should include more individuals with co-occurring neurodevelopmental conditions, a risk factor for a more resistant form of depression, and examine the instruments' capacity to detect clinically significant changes during an intervention.",

Aficamten is a cardiac myosin inhibitor that reduces left ventricular outflow tract gradients, improves exercise capacity, and decreases HCM symptoms when added to standard medications. Whether aficamten as monotherapy provides greater clinical benefit than beta-blockers as monotherapy remains unknown. We conducted an international, double-blind, double-dummy trial in which adults with symptomatic obstructive HCM were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive aficamten (at a daily dose of 5 mg to 20 mg) plus placebo or metoprolol (at a daily dose of 50 mg to 200 mg) plus placebo. The primary end point was the change in peak oxygen uptake at week 24; secondary end points were improvement at week 24 in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and changes at week 24 in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score (KCCQ-CSS), left ventricular outflow tract gradient after the Valsalva maneuver, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level, left atrial volume index, and left ventricular mass index. A total of 88 patients were assigned to the aficamten group and 87 to the metoprolol group.

In this study, the authors sought to assess the effects of intensive treatment targeting SBP <120 mm Hg on stroke compared with standard treatment targeting SBP <140 mm Hg. In the ESPRIT trial, hypertensive patients with high cardiovascular risk were randomly assigned to intensive treatment or standard treatment and followed for 3.4 years.

      "abstract": "Falls in care facilities are common events, causing considerable morbidity and mortality for older people. This is an update of a review on interventions in care facilities and hospitals first published in 2010 and updated in 2012 and 2018 on interventions in care facilities and hospitals. This review has now been split into separate reviews for each setting. To assess the benefits and harms of interventions designed to reduce the incidence of falls in older people in care facilities. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and two trial registers to 10 May 2024 and used reference checking, citation searching, and contact with authors to identify eligible trials and records. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of any intervention for preventing falls in older people (aged over 65 years) in care facilities with any comparator. We excluded trials conducted in places of residence that do not provide residential health-related care or rehabilitative services. We excluded trials where falls were recorded as adverse events of the intervention and those recruiting participants post-stroke or living with Parkinson's disease. Critical outcomes were rate of falls (number of falls per unit time) and number of fallers (risk of experiencing one or more falls). Important outcomes were risk of fracture, adverse events, and economic outcomes. We assessed risk of bias in the included studies against nine items (seven items from Cochrane's RoB 1 tool, plus method of ascertaining falls and baseline imbalance). Two review authors independently performed study selection and data analysis. We calculated rate ratios (RaR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for rate of falls and risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs for outcomes of risk of falling (number of people falling) and risk of fracture. We adjusted for clustering if not undertaken by trial authors. We grouped the results of trials with comparable interventions and participant characteristics, and pooled results where appropriate using the generic inverse variance method in RevMan. We conducted subgroup analyses according to intervention type, cognitive status, and informed by a qualitative comparative analysis where more than 10 trials were pooled and heterogeneity was high. Where pooling was precluded by the nature of the data, we presented trial data in tables for illustrative purposes or reported these in the text, or both. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. GRADE ratings of risk of bias were based on sensitivity analyses excluding trials at high risk of bias. We included 104 trials, 56 individually randomised and 48 cluster-randomised trials, with 68,964 participants. Thirty-three trials (27,492 participants) were added in this update. We assessed most of the included trials as at high risk of bias, often related to lack of blinding, which was rarely feasible for many intervention types. The certainty of evidence for the critical outcomes of falls ranged from high to very low. We have reported the critical outcomes for the main comparisons here. Regarding our important outcomes, adverse events were poorly reported, and the certainty of evidence was very low for all interventions; we have not reported these data here. The important outcomes of risk of fracture and cost-effectiveness are only reported here when the certainty of the evidence was stronger than very low. Multifactorial interventions. Overall, multifactorial interventions (i.e. two or more categories of intervention delivered based on individual risk profile) probably have little or no effect on the rate of falls (RaR 0.87, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.12; I² = 89%; 12 trials; 4843 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but probably reduce the risk of falling (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.00; I² = 19%; 11 trials; 4557 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Multifactorial interventions may be cost-effective in reducing falls (GBP 20,889 per quality-adjusted life year, UK health and social care perspective; 1 trial; 1657 participants; low-certainty evidence). A subgroup analysis informed by qualitative comparative analysis indicated that multifactorial interventions delivered in a tailored manner according to resident individual circumstances (e.g. living with dementia) with facility staff engagement have greater effects (P < 0.001) than those not delivered in this manner, and probably result in a large reduction in rate of falls (RaR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.69; I² = 0%; 7 trials; 3553 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and risk of falling (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.92; I² = 0%; 5 trials; 2993 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). All trials included assessment of environmental and personal risk factors (including medication optimisation and assessment of need for assistive aids) and exercise interventions. Exercise. As a single intervention, exercise was compared with usual care in 28 trials. At the end of the intervention period, active exercise probably reduces the rate of falls (RaR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91; I²= 84%; 14 trials; 2215 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and risk of falling (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.00; I² = 37%; 13 trials; 2408 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but may have little or no effect on risk of any fracture (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.78; 3 trials; 927 participants; low-certainty evidence). After a period of post-intervention follow-up, if active exercise is not sustained there is no effect on rate of falls (RaR 1.02, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.32; I² = 64%; 7 trials; 1354 participants; high-certainty evidence) and probably no effect on risk of falling (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.23; I² = 17%; 7 trials; 1443 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Active exercise may be cost-effective in reducing falls (AUD 18 per fall avoided, Australian health service perspective; 1 trial; 221 participants; low-certainty evidence). A subgroup analysis based on level of cognition indicated that active exercise may reduce the risk of falling in residents with cognitive impairment (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91; 4 trials; 451 participants; low-certainty evidence). Medication optimisation. As a single intervention, medication optimisation interventions were diverse, but overall may make little or no difference to rate of falls (RaR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.13; I² = 86%; 13 trials; 4314 participants; low-certainty evidence) and probably make little or no difference to risk of falling (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03; I² = 0%; 12 trials; 6209 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the impact of medication review/deprescribing on falls outcomes (RaR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; I² = 86%; 12 trials; 4125 participants; very low-certainty evidence; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01; I² = 0%; 9 trials; 1934 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Medication review/deprescribing as a single intervention may not be cost-effective (intervention had higher costs and falls, UK National Health Service and care home perspective; 1 trial; 826 participants; low-certainty evidence). Vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D supplementation (with or without calcium supplementation, alone or within a multivitamin) probably reduces the rate of falls (RaR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.86; I² = 72%; 5 trials; 4603 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) but probably makes little or no difference to the risk of falling (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.08; I² = 12%; 6 trials; 5186 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The population in these trials had low vitamin D levels. Nutrition: dairy food supplementation. Increasing servings of dairy to residents through dietitian assistance with menu design to enhance protein and calcium through provision of dairy foods may decrease the risk of falling and fractures from falls (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.00; RR fracture 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.93; 1 trial; 7195 participants; low-certainty evidence). Multifactorial interventions implemented with facility staff engagement and tailored intervention delivery according to individual residents' circumstances probably reduce the rate of falls and risk of falling and may be cost-effective. Regarding single interventions, exercise probably reduces the rate of falls and the risk of falling, but if exercise is not sustained it has no ongoing effect on the rate of falls and probably no effect on the risk of falling. Active exercise may reduce the risk of falling in residents with cognitive impairment and may be cost-effective. Medication optimisation interventions were diverse overall and may make little or no difference to the rate of falls and probably little or no difference to the risk of falling. We are very uncertain of the effectiveness of medication review/deprescribing as a single intervention at reducing falls. Vitamin D supplementation probably reduces the rate of falls but probably makes little or no difference to the risk of falling. Addressing nutrition, increasing servings of dairy through dietitian assistance with menu design may decrease the risk of falling and risk of fractures.

A subgroup analysis informed by qualitative comparative analysis indicated that multifactorial interventions delivered in a tailored manner according to resident individual circumstances (e.g. living with dementia) with facility staff engagement have greater effects (P < 0.001) than those not delivered in this manner, and probably result in a large reduction in rate of falls (RaR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.69; I² = 0%; 7 trials; 3553 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and risk of falling (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.92; I² = 0%; 5 trials; 2993 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). All trials included assessment of environmental and personal risk factors (including medication optimisation and assessment of need for assistive aids) and exercise interventions. Exercise. As a single intervention, exercise was compared with usual care in 28 trials. At the end of the intervention period, active exercise probably reduces the rate of falls (RaR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91; I²= 84%; 14 trials; 2215 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and risk of falling (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.00; I² = 37%; 13 trials; 2408 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but may have little or no effect on risk of any fracture (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.78; 3 trials; 927 participants; low-certainty evidence). After a period of post-intervention follow-up, if active exercise is not sustained there is no effect on rate of falls (RaR 1.02, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.32; I² = 64%; 7 trials; 1354 participants; high-certainty evidence) and probably no effect on risk of falling (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.23; I² = 17%; 7 trials; 1443 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Active exercise may be cost-effective in reducing falls (AUD 18 per fall avoided, Australian health service perspective; 1 trial; 221 participants; low-certainty evidence). A subgroup analysis based on level of cognition indicated that active exercise may reduce the risk of falling in residents with cognitive impairment (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.91; 4 trials; 451 participants; low-certainty evidence). Medication optimisation. As a single intervention, medication optimisation interventions were diverse, but overall may make little or no difference to rate of falls (RaR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.13; I² = 86%; 13 trials; 4314 participants; low-certainty evidence) and probably make little or no difference to risk of falling (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03; I² = 0%; 12 trials; 6209 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the impact of medication review/deprescribing on falls outcomes (RaR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.18; I² = 86%; 12 trials; 4125 participants; very low-certainty evidence; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01; I² = 0%; 9 trials; 1934 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Medication review/deprescribing as a single intervention may not be cost-effective (intervention had higher costs and falls, UK National Health Service and care home perspective; 1 trial; 826 participants; low-certainty evidence). Vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D supplementation (with or without calcium supplementation, alone or within a multivitamin) probably reduces the rate of falls (RaR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.86; I² = 72%; 5 trials; 4603 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) but probably makes little or no difference to the risk of falling (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.08; I² = 12%; 6 trials; 5186 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The population in these trials had low vitamin D levels. Nutrition: dairy food supplementation. Increasing servings of dairy to residents through dietitian assistance with menu design to enhance protein and calcium through provision of dairy foods may decrease the risk of falling and fractures from falls (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.00; RR fracture 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.93; 1 trial; 7195 participants; low-certainty evidence)."

          "text": "Multifactorial interventions implemented with facility staff engagement and tailored intervention delivery according to individual residents' circumstances probably reduce the rate of falls and risk of falling and may be cost-effective. Regarding single interventions, exercise probably reduces the rate of falls and the risk of falling, but if exercise is not sustained it has no ongoing effect on the rate of falls and probably no effect on the risk of falling. Active exercise may reduce the risk of falling in residents with cognitive impairment and may be cost-effective. Medication optimisation interventions were diverse overall and may make little or no difference to the rate of falls and probably little or no difference to the risk of falling. We are very uncertain of the effectiveness of medication review/deprescribing as a single intervention at reducing falls. Vitamin D supplementation probably reduces the rate of falls but probably makes little or no difference to the risk of falling. Addressing nutrition, increasing servings of dairy through dietitian assistance with menu design may decrease the risk of falling and risk of fractures."

We aimed to assess both non-inferiority and superiority of ecnoglutide versus dulaglutide, also a GLP-1 receptor agonist, in patients with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a 52-week, open-label, active-controlled, phase 3 trial at 52 hospitals in China. Adults aged 18-75 years with a BMI of 20-35 kg/m, a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, and elevated glucose concentrations on metformin monotherapy were included. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous ecnoglutide (0·6 mg or 1·2 mg) or dulaglutide (1·5 mg) once weekly. The primary endpoint was mean change from baseline in HbA at week 32 (non-inferiority for ecnoglutide 0·6 mg and 1·2 mg, with a 0·4% non-inferiority margin; superiority for ecnoglutide 1·2 mg) and was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study treatment (full analysis set). Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one safety evaluation after starting treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05680129) and has ended.

At week 32, mean HbA reductions were 1·91% (SE 0·05; -20·86 mmol/mol [0·53]) with ecnoglutide 0·6 mg, 1·89% (0·05; -20·69 mmol/mol [0·54]) with ecnoglutide 1·2 mg, and 1·65% (0·05; -18·02 mmol/mol [0·53]) with dulaglutide. Estimated treatment differences versus dulaglutide were -0·26% (95% CI -0·39 to -0·13; -2·84 mmol/mol [-4·29 to -1·38]) with ecnoglutide 0·6 mg and -0·24% (-0·38 to -0·11; -2·67 mmol/mol [-4·14 to -1·20]; p=0·0002 for superiority) with ecnoglutide 1·2 mg. HbA reductions were sustained to week 52. During the 52 weeks, six (3%) of 206 patients in the ecnoglutide 0·6 mg group, eight (4%) of 208 patients in the ecnoglutide 1·2 mg group, and six (3%) of 207 patients in the dulaglutide group discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Once-weekly ecnoglutide 0·6 mg and 1·2 mg were non-inferior to dulaglutide 1·5 mg in reducing HbA in adults with type 2 diabetes and elevated glucose concentrations on metformin monotherapy.
