      "abstract": "Cardiac myosin-binding protein C (cMyC) is a cardiac-specific sarcomeric protein with faster release kinetics compared with those of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn). The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of cMyC, measured with a novel prototype automated immunoassay, with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) for the early diagnosis of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Furthermore, we derived a single blood draw dual-biomarker strategy combining hs-cTn and cMyC and compared it with the hs-cTnT/I-only strategy endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology. This was a secondary analysis from an international prospective study recruiting adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with suspected NSTEMI. cMyC, hs-cTnT, and hs-cTnI concentrations were measured upon ED presentation. Final diagnoses were centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists blinded to cMyC values. To compare the single- and dual-biomarker strategy, safety (defined as the sensitivity and negative predictive value for ruling out index NSTEMI) and triage efficacy (defined as the proportion of patients triaged to either rule-out or rule-in) were assessed. The diagnostic endpoint was index NSTEMI. The prognostic endpoint was 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year cardiovascular death or MI. Findings were externally validated in an independent international cohort. Among 4,735 eligible patients, 854 (18%) were diagnosed with NSTEMI. The discrimination for NSTEMI at presentation was higher for cMyC (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.943; 95% CI: 0.936-0.95) than for hs-cTnT (AUC: 0.936; 95% CI: 0.929-0.944; P = 0.008). Differences were mainly driven by patients with chest pain onset ≤3 hours (AUC of 0.939 [95% CI: 0.928-0.951] vs 0.921 [95% CI: 0.907-0.936], respectively; P < 0.001). The dual-biomarker strategy increased overall triage efficacy from 26.8% (hs-cTnT only) to 60.0% (hs-cTnT and cMyC), without compromising safety during the index visit. Despite identifying up to 3 times more patients for rule-out, the dual-biomarker strategy showed comparable cumulative incidences of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction at 30 days, 1 year, and 5 years. Similar results were observed with hs-cTnI and in the external validation cohort. CMyC adds significant incremental value to hs-cTn values in the early diagnosis of NSTEMI, improving diagnostic discrimination and enabling more patients to be safely and immediately ruled out for NSTEMI. The single blood draw dual-biomarker strategy is particularly attractive in busy ED settings due to its simplicity and quick time-to-decision.

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of bi-weekly cofrogliptin treatment as a replacement for daily dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled study assigned participants in a 1:1 ratio to either the daily DPP-4i group or the 10 mg cofrogliptin group. The DPP-4i group continued their original daily DPP-4i regimen for 24 weeks, whereas the cofrogliptin group discontinued the daily DPP-4i and received the investigational drug orally once every 2 weeks. All participants underwent 14-day continuous glucose monitoring at weeks 10-12 and 22-24 during the treatment period. The main endpoint was the change in glucose time in range (TIR; 3.9-10.0 mmol/L) from baseline to week 24. Additionally, the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire scores, adverse events, and hypoglycaemic events were compared between groups. The enrolment period was from 31 January 2024 to 20 November 2024. A total of 64 participants were randomized to receive either cofrogliptin (n = 31) or a daily DPP-4i (n = 33). The least squares (LS) mean (standard error) change in TIR from baseline after 24 weeks was 0.037% ± 2.506% in the cofrogliptin group compared to -9.891% ± 2.435% in the daily DPP-4i group. The LS mean difference was 9.929% (95% confidence interval: 3.064%-16.793%), which was statistically significant (p = 0.0046). The incidence, classification, and severity of adverse events were similar between the two groups. Bi-weekly cofrogliptin treatment, instead of daily DPP-4i, could effectively control blood glucose levels in a 24-week treatment period and their fluctuations and was well tolerated in Chinese patients with T2DM.",

A multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts and methodologists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework to prioritize clinical questions, identify patient-centered outcomes, conduct an evidence synthesis, and develop recommendations. The guideline panel agreed on 16 recommendations, of which 1 is a strong recommendation, 9 are conditional recommendations, and 6 were identified as knowledge gaps. In adult patients with moderate-to-severely active CD, the AGA recommends the use of infliximab, adalimumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab, guselkumab, or upadacitinib over no treatment, and suggests the use of certolizumab pegol or vedolizumab over no treatment. In individuals who are naïve to advanced therapies, the AGA suggests using a higher efficacy medication (infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab, or guselkumab) rather than a lower-efficacy medication (certolizumab pegol or upadacitinib). In individuals who have previously been exposed to 1 or more advanced therapies, the AGA suggests using a higher efficacy medication (adalimumab, risankizumab, guselkumab, or upadacitinib) or intermediate efficacy medication (ustekinumab or mirikizumab) rather than a lower efficacy medication (vedolizumab or certolizumab pegol). In adult outpatients with moderate-to-severely active CD, the AGA suggests against using thiopurine monotherapy for induction of remission, but suggests using thiopurine monotherapy over no treatment for maintenance of (typically corticosteroid-induced) remission. The AGA suggests using subcutaneous methotrexate for induction and maintenance of remission, but suggests against using oral methotrexate. The AGA suggests using combination therapy with infliximab and thiopurines over infliximab monotherapy, particularly in those naïve to thiopurines. The AGA also suggests using initial advanced therapy over step therapy involving corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators in patients with moderate-to-severely active CD. The panel also proposed key implementation considerations for optimal use of these medications, identified several knowledge gaps, and areas for future research.

In this multicentre, randomised, open-label trial, 59 adults were allocated 1:1 to efsubaglutide alfa 3 mg Q2W or 1 mg QW for 12 weeks after a 1-week 1 mg run-in. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 13 (end of 12-week treatment). Secondary endpoints included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), CGM time in range (TIR, 3.9-10.0 mmol/L) and tight TIR (3.9-7.8 mmol/L), 24-h mean glucose, weight, lipids, and adverse events. Continuous outcomes were analysed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM); categorical outcomes used stratified Mantel-Haenszel tests; p values/CI were descriptive. HbA1c decreased by -1.45% (SE 0.14) with Q2W and -1.53% (0.14) with QW; LS mean difference (Q2W-QW) 0.09% (95% CI -0.32, 0.50). FPG fell similarly (-2.07 vs. -2.22 mmol/L). TIR increased from 45.0% to 77.2% with Q2W and 75.1% with QW; tight TIR reached 53.8% and 48.8%, respectively. End-of-treatment 24-h mean CGM glucose was 8.12 versus 8.66 mmol/L (Q2W vs. QW). At week 13, HbA1c <7.0% was achieved by 55.2% (Q2W) and 65.5% (QW); ≤6.5% by 37.9% and 24.1%. Gastrointestinal adverse events predominated and were mostly mild to moderate; no hypoglycaemia or cardiovascular events occurred. Over 12 weeks, efsubaglutide alfa 3 mg Q2W provided glycaemic and CGM benefits comparable to 1 mg QW with favourable tolerability. These findings support the feasibility of a biweekly regimen as an alternative to weekly dosing; larger, longer-duration confirmatory trials in more diverse populations are warranted.",

Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) is a measure of skin barrier function with emerging utility in atopy and food allergy. To determine whether use of TEWL as a stopping criterion can prevent anaphylaxis during a peanut oral food challenge (OFC). This was a single-center randomized clinical trial of children aged 6 months to 5 years with a history of a clinical peanut allergic reaction and positive peanut skin prick and/or serum immunoglobulin E testing. All participants underwent peanut OFC at an allergy referral clinic. The study began May 1, 2023, and ended August 31, 2024. The intervention was stopping OFC based on a 1 g/m2/h rise in TEWL plus 1 objective allergic symptom observed by the physician during OFC. Standard OFC stopping criteria or the intervention criteria, whichever came first, were used in the intervention group. OFC stopping criteria from standard research were used in the control group. This was a single-intervention study. Rate of anaphylaxis, defined as a Consortium for Food Allergy Research (CoFAR) score of 2 or higher, compared between the intervention and control groups using 4 anaphylaxis criteria approaches: CoFAR, Brighton Collaboration, Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN), and World Allergy Organization (WAO). A total of 40 participants were included in the final analysis. The mean (SD) age of participants was 31.8 (16.18) months, with a median of 32.5 (range, 9-62) months; 23 (58%) were male. Using CoFAR criteria, among reactors, the anaphylaxis rate was 10 of 16 (63%; 95% CI, 39%-86%) in the intervention group compared with 14 of 14 (100%; 95% CI, 100%-100%) in the control group (P = .02). Using WAO criteria, 2 of 16 participants were reactors in the intervention group (anaphylaxis rate, 13%; 95% CI, 0%-29%) compared with 8 of 14 (57%; 95% CI, 31%-83%) in the control group (P = .02). There was no significant difference when comparing anaphylaxis rates using Brighton or FAAN criteria (eg, rate of 56% [95% CI, 32%-81%] vs 71% [95% CI, 48%-95%] in intervention vs control participants using Brighton criteria [P = .47]). The median CoFAR score in reactors in the intervention vs control groups was 1.8 (IQR, 1.0-2.0) vs 2.6 (IQR, 2.0-3.0) (P = .006). Eight of 16 participants (50%) in the intervention vs 12 of 14 (86%) in the control group required epinephrine (P = .06). In this randomized clinical trial, prospective use of TEWL as a stopping criterion reduced anaphylaxis rates during OFC in children with peanut allergy, suggesting use of TEWL could make OFC safer and more accessible.

To assess whether early administration of levosimendan reduces the time to successful VA-ECMO weaning in patients with severe but potentially reversible cardiogenic shock. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted across 11 intensive care units (ICUs) in France. Between August 27, 2021, and September 10, 2024, 205 adult patients with acute cardiogenic shock who had started VA-ECMO in the preceding 48 hours were enrolled. Final follow-up was completed on November 10, 2024. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive levosimendan, 0.15 μg/kg per minute, to be increased to 0.20 μg/kg per minute after 2 hours (n = 101), or placebo (n = 104). The primary outcome was time to successful ECMO weaning within 30 days following randomization. Secondary outcomes included ECMO-, mechanical ventilation-, and organ failure-free days, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, serious adverse events, and all-cause 30- and 60-day mortality. Among the 205 randomized patients (median age, 58 [IQR, 50-67] years; 149 [72.7%] male), main cardiogenic shock etiologies were postcardiotomy (79 [38.5%]), acute myocardial infarction (56 [27.3%]), and myocarditis (28 [13.7%]).

      "abstract": "Tricuspid valve infective endocarditis (TVIE) is increasingly prevalent, especially among intravenous drug users. Surgical intervention is the standard treatment for severe cases, but percutaneous mechanical aspiration (PMA) has emerged as a less invasive alternative in high-risk patients. Comparative data on both strategies remain limited. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of PMA versus surgical management in patients with TVIE through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A comprehensive search of 5 databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus) through July 2025 identified studies comparing PMA and surgery for TVIE. Outcomes included all-cause mortality (30-day and 1-year), hospital length of stay, in-hospital mortality, and readmission for endocarditis. Risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) were pooled using a random-effects model. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I. Ten retrospective studies involving 6,035 patients were included (974 treated with PMA and 5,061 treated with surgery). The risk of in-hospital mortality was similar between PMA and surgery (RR = 1.07; p = 0.91). PMA was associated with a higher risk for 30-day mortality (RR = 2.71; 95% CI 1.53 to 4.82; p <0.001) but not for 1-year mortality (RR = 1.13; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.77; p = 0.60) or readmission for endocarditis (RR = 0.82; p = 0.63) compared with surgery. PMA was also associated with a shorter hospital stay (MD = -7.0 days; 95% CI -13.0 to -1.1; p = 0.03). The risk of bias was moderate to serious in all studies. In conclusion, the present systematic review of ten retrospective studies, surgical management of TVIE was associated with better short-term survival compared with PMA although the risks of 1-year mortality and readmission were similar. Randomized trials are required to better define the risk benefit profile of these approaches to TVIE.",

This study sought to compare the economic and quality of life outcomes of CABG vs PCI and determine their cost-effectiveness in the FAME (Fractional Flow Reserve vs Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation) 3 randomized trial. FAME 3 randomly assigned 1,500 patients with 3-vessel CAD to either CABG or fractional flow reserve-guided PCI using zotarolimus drug-eluting stents. We documented resource use and quality of life over 5 years of follow-up. We calculated costs by applying Medicare reimbursement rates to resources used, assessed quality of life using the EuroQOL EQ-5D, calculated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from EQ-5D utility values, and used multivariable regression to compare outcomes by treatment assignment. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio based on 5-year outcomes and also on projected life expectancies, and assessed its variability in 10,000 bootstrap replications. Cumulative costs over 5 years were 30% higher in patients assigned to CABG (95% CI: 16%-46%; P < 0.001). QALYs over 5 years did not differ significantly between the PCI (4.05 ± 0.84) and CABG groups (4.03 ± 0.82), although EQ-5D scores improved more rapidly after PCI. Patients <65 years of age at enrollment assigned to PCI were more likely to be employed at 5 years (56% vs 47%; P = 0.025). PCI had greater economic value than CABG over 5 years, with lower costs and higher QALYs in 66% of replications, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for CABG above the $150,000/QALY benchmark in 98% of bootstrap replications. These findings were essentially unchanged in several lifetime projections based on the outcomes documented within the trial follow-up period. Fractional flow reserve-guided PCI using zotarolimus drug-eluting stents provides significantly better long-term value than CABG for treatment of patients with multivessel CAD, with equivalent clinical outcomes at substantially lower cost.",

      "abstract": "People with cardiovascular disease are at risk of recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events, and chronic low-grade inflammation may be a major underlying factor. Treatment with low-dose colchicine has been proposed for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in individuals at high cardiovascular risk. A previous Cochrane review showed considerable uncertainty regarding the benefits and harms of this approach. To evaluate the benefits and harms of low-dose colchicine in the prevention of cardiovascular events in adults with a history of stable CVD or following myocardial infarction or stroke. We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature until February 2025 using Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the drugs@FDA database, references of key papers, and references of included studies. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of low-dose colchicine for a minimum of six months versus any control intervention in patients of any age with cardiovascular disease (i.e. history of stable cardiovascular disease, previous myocardial infarction or stroke). Our critical outcomes were all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and serious adverse events. Our important outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, stroke, all-cause hospitalisations, coronary revascularisation (percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)/angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)), quality of life, and gastrointestinal adverse events (i.e. diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, or vomiting). Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB2 tool. We conducted meta-analyses using the random-effects model. We generated forest plots to facilitate visualisation of the data. We did not perform any subgroup analysis. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for all critical outcomes and for cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and coronary revascularisation. This was carried out by two review authors working independently. We included 12 studies involving 22,983 randomised participants. The follow-up in the studies ranged from 6 to 80 months. Overall, 11,524 participants were assigned to low-dose colchicine treatment and 11,459 were assigned to a control intervention, which constituted either usual care plus placebo or usual care only. The doses of colchicine used were 0.5 mg once or twice daily. At baseline, the mean age of participants ranged from 57 to 74 years. Most participants (79.4%) were male. There is high-certainty evidence that low-dose colchicine treatment reduces the risk of myocardial infarction, with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.96; 22,153 participants, 8 studies; I = 51%), yielding an absolute risk reduction of 9 fewer events (95% CI 16 fewer to 2 fewer) per 1000 patients, when the myocardial infarction rate is about 4% (36 events per 1000 patients) in the control group. There is also high-certainty evidence that low-dose colchicine reduces the risk of stroke with a RR of 0.67 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.95; 22,483 participants, 10 studies; I = 40%), yielding an absolute risk reduction of 8 fewer events (95% CI 12 fewer to 1 fewer) per 1000 patients, when the stroke rate is about 2% (22 events per 1000 patients) in the control group. There is high-certainty evidence that the use of low-dose colchicine does not increase the rate of serious adverse events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.02; 15,677 participants, 4 studies; I = 0%). However, gastrointestinal adverse events were more common under treatment with colchicine (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.57; 22,185 participants, 10 studies; I = 91%). For all other outcomes assessed, the evidence is of moderate certainty. Colchicine probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.21; 22,747 participants, 10 studies; I = 1%; moderate-certainty evidence), in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.22; 22,271 participants; 8 studies; I = 13%; moderate-certainty evidence), and coronary revascularisation (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.08; 13,705 participants, 5 studies; I = 40%; moderate-certainty evidence). There is no evidence about the benefits or harms of colchicine on quality-of-life or on the risk of all-cause hospitalisation. People with cardiovascular disease using low-dose colchicine as secondary prevention for at least six months benefit from reduced rates of myocardial infarction and stroke, without an increase in serious adverse events. Moderate-certainty evidence did not show a benefit from low-dose colchicine for the risk of mortality (i.e. all-cause and cardiovascular mortality) or coronary revascularisation rates. Colchicine use was associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse events, which were typically described as mild and transient in nature. Additional studies are warranted to investigate the benefits and harms of low-dose colchicine in relevant subgroups and in specific indications, such as long-term use in individuals with stable coronary artery disease versus limited-time use following acute coronary syndrome.

Acoramidis, an approved oral therapy for ATTR-CM, achieves early, near-complete (≥90%) TTR stabilization. In the phase 3 ATTRibute-CM (Efficacy and Safety of Acoramidis in Participants with Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy) study, acoramidis significantly reduced the composite of all-cause mortality or first CV-related hospitalization (CVH), with an effect observed at month 3. Its efficacy on the burden of cumulative CV outcome events has not been reported. This study was a post hoc exploratory recurrent-event analysis of the efficacy of acoramidis on the cumulative incidence of CV outcomes from ATTRibute-CM and its open-label extension. Cumulative incidences of centrally adjudicated CV-related mortality (CVM) or recurrent CVH (first and, if applicable, subsequent CVH), recurrent CVH alone (month 30), and CVM (month 42) were measured in the modified intention-to-treat population (acoramidis, n = 409; placebo, n = 202). Mean cumulative events by treatment, and the difference between treatment groups were estimated by using a modified Andersen-Gill model. Acoramidis significantly reduced the cumulative risk of CVM or recurrent CVH through month 30 vs placebo (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.43-0.62; P < 0.0001). A notable proportion of CV outcome events (19% of CVM or recurrent CVH events, 22% of CVH) occurred within the first 6 months. Numerically fewer cumulative events were observed with acoramidis compared with placebo at month 1, and the difference increased progressively, resulting at month 30 in 53 events avoided per 100 treated participants (95% CI: 29-79). At month 42, CVM was reduced with continuous acoramidis vs placebo-to-acoramidis (HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.39-0.79; P = 0.0011). The annualized frequency of recurrent CVH was significantly decreased through month 30 (relative risk ratio: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.35-0.69; P < 0.0001). Acoramidis significantly reduced the cumulative burden of CV outcomes in ATTR-CM over 30 months. Numerically fewer events were observed with acoramidis vs placebo by month 1, and the difference increased progressively over time, resulting in 53 events avoided per 100 treated patients at month 30. Almost one-fourth of the cumulative CV events occurred within the first 6 months. These exploratory findings suggest that cumulative event burden may occur early, highlighting the importance of timely evaluation, diagnosis and treatment in ATTR-CM.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the relative effectiveness (rVE) of HD-IIV vs standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine (SD-IIV) against severe clinical outcomes in persons with CKD from the elderly general population. DANFLU-2 (A Pragmatic Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Effectiveness of High-Dose Influenza Vaccine vs. Standard-Dose Influenza Vaccine in Older Adults) was a pragmatic, open-label, individually randomized trial conducted in Denmark during the 2022-2023, 2023-2024, and 2024-2025 influenza seasons with the aim of assessing the rVE of HD-IIV vs SD-IIV in an older adult general population. In this prespecified secondary analysis, we assessed the rVE against severe clinical outcomes according to the presence of CKD. CKD was defined using data from laboratory registries and International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision diagnosis codes 10 years before vaccination. Among 332,438 DANFLU-2 participants (mean age 73.7 ± 5.8 years; 48.6% women), 46,788 (14.1%) had CKD at baseline. The effect of HD-IIV vs SD-IIV on hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia differed by CKD status: rVE was 16.9% (95% CI: 3.4%-28.5%) in participants with CKD vs 0.6% (95% CI: -9.6% to 9.9%) in those without CKD (P interaction = 0.046). Absolute risks for hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia were 1.7% with SD-IIV vs 1.3% with HD-IIV in CKD, corresponding to an absolute risk reduction of -0.29% (95% CI: -0.50% to 0.058%; number needed to treat [NNT] = 359). For influenza hospitalizations specifically, the benefit of HD-IIV was also substantially greater in CKD: rVE 68.6% (95% CI: 46.7%-82.3%; NNT = 561) vs 30.6% (95% CI: 7.2%-48.2%; NNT =3,953) in non-CKD (P interaction = 0.0079). Reductions in hospitalizations for cardiorespiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and laboratory-confirmed influenza were consistent regardless of CKD (all P interaction > 0.05). In this prespecified analysis of DANFLU-2, including the largest CKD population ever in an individually randomized vaccine trial, we observed a benefit of HD-IIV vs SD-IIV against hospitalization for influenza or pneumonia, as well as hospitalization for influenza, with suggestion of a greater relative benefit among those with CKD.

      "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have been established as effective treatments for type 2 diabetes, offering benefits beyond glycaemic control; however, their associations across multiple health outcomes remain insufficiently assessed. Thus, we conducted an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to comprehensively evaluate the broad spectrum of their effects. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar through June 13, 2025, to identify meta-analyses of RCTs assessing the effects of GLP-1RAs on various health outcomes, including cardiovascular, renal, metabolic, oncologic, gastrointestinal and other domains. Effect sizes were recalculated using random-effects models and converted to equivalent odds ratios (eORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for consistency. The methodological quality of each review was assessed using the AMSTAR 2, and the certainty of evidence for each association was evaluated according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework (high, moderate, low or very low certainty). We preregistered our study protocol with PROSPERO (CRD420251112823). After applying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 studies comprising 432 RCTs were included, covering 65 unique outcomes across 6 clinical domains. GLP-1RAs use was associated with reduced risks of heart failure (eOR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.64-0.79]; low certainty) and peripheral artery disease (0.75 [0.67-0.84]; low certainty). Drug-specific analyses exhibited protective effects of liraglutide (eOR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.80-0.91]), albiglutide (0.65 [0.47-0.89]), and dulaglutide (0.78 [0.68-0.90]) for major cardiovascular events, myocardial infarction and stroke, respectively. Renal outcomes indicated that GLP-1RAs use was associated with reducing the risk of kidney-specific composite outcomes (eOR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.66-0.87]; low certainty), including nephropathy (0.74 [0.61-0.92]; low certainty) and albuminuria (0.73 [0.55-0.97]; very low certainty). GLP-1RAs were also associated with reductions in body weight (eOR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.36-0.60]; moderate certainty) and glycated haemoglobin A1c (0.83 [0.71-0.97]; high certainty), but no substantial association with cancer risk was found. Gastrointestinal adverse events, including nausea (9.62 [4.60-20.10]; high certainty), dyspepsia (4.85 [1.52-15.45]; moderate certainty), and constipation (3.39 [1.54-7.47]; high certainty), were consistently reported. GLP-1RAs use was associated with higher lumbar spine (eOR, 1.99 [95% CI, 1.38-2.85]; low certainty) and hip-neck bone mineral density (1.79 [1.08-2.98]; low certainty). In this study, GLP-1RAs were associated with cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic benefits in type 2 diabetes without increasing cancer risk, though gastrointestinal adverse events were common. Our findings support the clinical use of GLP-1RAs, with attention to individual risk profiles and treatment tolerability.",

Inconsistent implementation of evidence-based recommendations for infection prevention and management and delays in detection and treatment of maternal sepsis contribute to the number of preventable deaths. We conducted a cluster-randomized trial to assess a multicomponent intervention, the Active Prevention and Treatment of Maternal Sepsis (APT-Sepsis) program. This program was designed to support health care providers in achieving three goals: adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) hand-hygiene standards; adoption of evidence-based practices for maternal infection prevention and management; and early detection of sepsis and use of the FAST-M (fluids, antibiotics, source control, transfer if required, and monitoring) treatment bundle. Usual care was provided in the control group, along with dissemination of guidelines. The primary outcome was a composite of infection-related maternal death, infection-related near-miss event (events in which women survived a life-threatening complication), or severe infection-related illness (deep surgical-site, deep perineal, or body-cavity infection) among women who were pregnant or had recently been pregnant. We randomly assigned 59 health facilities (where 431,394 women gave birth during the trial) in Malawi and Uganda to the intervention group (30 clusters) or the usual-care group (29 clusters). A primary-outcome event occurred in 1.4% of the patients in the intervention group and in 1.9% of those in the usual-care group (risk ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.83; P<0.001). This effect was generally consistent between countries and among facilities of difference sizes and was sustained over time. Implementation of the APT-Sepsis program led to a significantly lower risk of a composite of infection-related maternal death, infection-related near-miss event, or severe infection-related illness than usual care.

Compared to patients with lower UACR, those with higher UACR were younger, with a more frequent history of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, and lower eGFR.

Whether this survival advantage persists among adults with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown. To examine sex differences in mortality and treatment with kidney replacement therapy (KRT; including dialysis and transplant) among adults with incident stage 5 CKD. This population-based cohort study used linked administrative and kidney care program data from Alberta, Canada. Adults 18 years and older with incident non-KRT-dependent stage 5 CKD were identified between April 2005 and March 2019 and observed from study entry until death, out-migration, or March 2021. Data were analyzed from January to August 2025. Sex-specific, age-stratified standardized mortality ratios were calculated using general population mortality data. Five-year probabilities of all-cause death, receipt of maintenance dialysis, and kidney transplant were estimated in incident stage 5 CKD cases using multistate models, stratified by age and presence of diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Among 7506 cohort members, 4121 (54.9%) were male (median [IQR] age, 70 [58-80] years), and 3385 (45.1%) were female (median [IQR] age, 74 [61-83] years). The median (IQR) follow-up was 7.9 (4.7-11.5) years. Compared with the general population, female individuals experienced greater excess mortality than male individuals, particularly at younger ages (eg, among adults younger than 55 years: standardized mortality ratio, 40.9 [95% CI, 34.6-47.3] in female individuals vs 15.9 [95% CI, 13.5-18.2] in male individuals); this difference narrowed with increasing age. Within the stage 5 CKD cohort, 5-year all-cause mortality risks were higher in younger female individuals than male individuals (younger than 55 years: 20.7% vs 14.6%) and similar between sexes at older ages. Irrespective of comorbidity, female individuals younger than 65 years were substantially less likely to receive a kidney transplant, and female individuals 65 years and older were less likely to receive dialysis or a transplant. In this cohort study using data from a universal health care system, across all ages, the female survival advantage observed in the general population was absent or even reversed after developing stage 5 CKD. Fewer female individuals transitioned to KRT treatment, independent of their comorbidities. Younger female individuals experienced the greatest survival disadvantage and were less likely to receive a transplant. These findings suggest that differences in treatment decision-making or inequities in access to KRT may contribute to poorer outcomes in female individuals, especially at younger ages. Further investigations are warranted to understand the potential underlying structural, social, and biological mechanisms.",

Systematic reviews that used meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials were eligible if they compared a drug or non-drug intervention with a passive control in individuals with a diagnosis of ADHD. Primary outcomes were severity of ADHD symptoms, analysed by rater type (clinician-rated, parent-rated, teacher-rated, or self-rated) and time point (short term (12 weeks, or study endpoint), medium term (26 weeks), and long term (52 weeks)),acceptability (participants dropping out for any reason), and tolerability (participants dropping out owing to any side effects). Secondary outcomes included daily functioning, quality of life, comorbid symptoms, and key side effects (decreased sleep and appetite). Eligible meta-analyses were re-estimated with a standardised statistical approach. Methodological quality was assessed using AMSTAR-2. Evidence certainty was evaluated using an algorithmic version of the GRADE framework, adapted for drug and non-drug interventions. 115 of 414 full text articles were deemed eligible and 299 were excluded; the eligible articles comprised 221 unique combinations of participants, interventions, comparators, and outcomes.

      "abstract": "The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed these rapid practice points addressing the comparative effectiveness and harms of trivalent (3 different influenza viruses or viral proteins) and quadrivalent (4 different influenza viruses or viral proteins) influenza vaccines in adults aged 18 years or older who are not pregnant or immunocompromised. These practice points do not address adults aged 18 years or older who are pregnant or immunocompromised. The ACP Population Health and Medical Science Committee (PHMSC) developed the rapid practice points on the basis of a rapid review by the ACP Center for Evidence Reviews at Cochrane Austria. The rapid review was a focused update of the 2024 comprehensive, high-quality systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The ACP PHMSC focused on the comparative effectiveness of influenza vaccines compared with each other because of the established efficacy and safety of the standard influenza vaccines.",
