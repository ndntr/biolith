      "abstract": "To determine whether hyperangulated videolaryngoscopy (HAVL) improves first-attempt success (FAS) in adult orotracheal intubations compared to standard-geometry videolaryngoscopy (SGVL), with a focus on emergency settings. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative observational studies evaluating HAVL versus SGVL in adult tracheal intubations. Comprehensive searches were performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus, and web of science from inception through November 2024. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB2 and Newcastle-Ottawa tools, and certainty of evidence was rated using GRADE. Both emergency and operating room intubations were included; most emergency data derived from large cohort studies. Of 4445 screened records, 25 studies (17 RCTs, 8 observational; 38,597 patients) were included. HAVL was associated with lower FAS overall (87.2 % vs 91.0 %; pooled RR 0.96, 95 % CI 0.94-0.99; p = 0.002). In emergency intubations (8 studies; n = 34,927), HAVL yielded reduced FAS (RR 0.97, 95 % CI 0.95-0.99; p = 0.003). There was no significant difference in difficult airways (RR 0.98, 95 % CI 0.92-1.05; p = 0.57). HAVL was linked to higher rates of airway trauma (7.5 % vs 2.9 %; RR 1.88, 95 % CI 1.01-3.49; p = 0.046) and numerically more adverse events. Certainty of evidence was low due to risk of bias and heterogeneity. In emergency intubations, HAVL was associated with lower first-attempt success and increased airway trauma compared to SGVL. These findings support prioritizing SGVL for emergency airway management, with careful operator training if HAVL is used.",

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are among the few pharmacotherapy options available for this population, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of efficacy and safety. To assess the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RAs in children and adolescents (<18 years) with obesity, prediabetes, or T2D. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published from inception until February 28, 2025. Data analysis was completed from January 2025 to April 2025. RCTs comparing GLP-1 RAs to placebo in children and adolescents with obesity, overweight, prediabetes, or T2D with reported safety and efficacy data were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data on sample size, population, interventions, follow-up, and outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using version 2 of the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB2). Efficacy outcomes (except lipids) were analyzed as estimated treatment differences, lipids as estimated treatment ratios, and safety via rate ratios. A random-effects inverse variance model was used for all outcomes. The primary efficacy outcomes were change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (in percentage points), fasting glucose (in milligrams per deciliter), body weight (in kilograms), body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), BMI z scores or percentiles, BMI standard deviation score (SDS), lipid outcomes, and blood pressure. Exploratory efficacy outcomes included obstructive sleep apnea and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Safety outcomes included gastrointestinal adverse effects (GI AEs), infections, hepatobiliary disorders, suicidal ideation or behaviors, depression, hypoglycemia, and adverse event discontinuations. A total of 18 RCTs (11 in obesity, 6 in T2D, and 1 in prediabetes) with 1402 participants (838 GLP-1 RA users and 564 placebo) were included (mean [range] age, 13.7 [6-17] years; 831 female participants (59.3%); median [IQR] treatment duration, 0.51 [0.25-1.00] years). GLP-1 RAs significantly reduced HbA1c (-0.44%; 95% CI, -0.68% to -0.21%), fasting glucose (-9.92 mg/dL; 95% CI, -16.20 to -3.64), body weight (-3.02 kg; 95% CI, -4.98 to -1.06), BMI (-1.45; 95% CI, -2.40 to -0.49), BMI SDS (-0.20; 95% CI, -0.36 to -0.05), BMI percentile (-7.24%; 95% CI, -12.97% to -1.51%), and systolic blood pressure (-2.73 mm Hg; 95% CI, -4.04 to -1.43) and increased GI AE (log[rate ratio] [RR], 0.75). Other AEs, including suicidal ideation or behaviors, showed no significant differences. In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 trials, GLP-1 RAs significantly improved glycemic, weight, and cardiometabolic outcomes in children and adolescents with T2D or obesity. Available data over a relatively short follow-up suggested suicidal ideation or behaviors were not significantly different, although GI AEs warrant attention in long-term management.",

The primary outcomes were changes in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting glucagon levels, body weight, waist circumference, along with the incidence of adverse events (AEs). Secondary outcomes included body mass index (BMI), lipid profiles, and blood pressure. Six RCTs involving 1272 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with placebo, survodutide significantly reduced HbA1c (weighted mean difference [WMD]: -0.66%, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-1.08, -0.23], p = 0.002) and fasting glucagon levels (WMD: -7 pmol/L, 95% CI [-10.3, -3.69], p = 0.016).

Additionally, significant reductions were observed in BMI, and modest reductions were noted in total cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure.

A greater reduction in HbA1c was specifically associated with a higher total weekly dose (>2.4 mg), while more pronounced effects on body weight and waist circumference were observed with both higher doses and longer treatment durations (>16 weeks). However, it is crucial to highlight the significant increase in gastrointestinal AEs and the associated risk of treatment discontinuation.

In this phase 3, multinational, randomized, double-blind trial, we examined the safety and efficacy of once-daily orforglipron at doses of 6 mg, 12 mg, or 36 mg, as compared with placebo (assigned in a 3:3:3:4 ratio) as an adjunct to healthy diet and physical activity for 72 weeks. All the patients had obesity without diabetes mellitus. The primary end point was the percent change in body weight from baseline to week 72, as assessed according to the treatment-regimen estimand in the intention-to-treat population. A total of 3127 patients underwent randomization. The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 72 was -7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], -8.2 to -6.8) with 6 mg of orforglipron, -8.4% (95% CI, -9.1 to -7.7) with 12 mg of orforglipron, and -11.2% (95% CI, -12.0 to -10.4) with 36 mg of orforglipron, as compared with -2.1% (95% CI, -2.8 to -1.4) with placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). Among the patients in the orforglipron 36-mg group, 54.6% had a reduction of 10% or more, 36.0% had a reduction of 15% or more, and 18.4% had a reduction of 20% or more, as compared with 12.9%, 5.9%, and 2.8% of the patients, respectively, in the placebo group. Waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and non-HDL cholesterol levels significantly improved with orforglipron treatment as compared with placebo. Adverse events resulted in treatment discontinuation in 5.3 to 10.3% of the patients in the orforglipron groups and in 2.7% of those in the placebo group. The most common adverse events with orforglipron were gastrointestinal effects, which were mostly mild to moderate. In adults with obesity, 72-week treatment with orforglipron led to significantly greater reductions in body weight than placebo; the adverse-event profile was consistent with that of other GLP-1 receptor agonists.

      "abstract": "Poorly controlled hypertension is a common problem worldwide, particularly in low-resource settings. We conducted an open-label, randomized, controlled trial of a home-based model of hypertension care in South Africa. Adults with hypertension were assigned to receive home-based care, which consisted of patient monitoring of blood pressure, home visits from a community health worker (CHW) for data collection and medication delivery, and remote nurse-led decision making supported by a mobile application (CHW group); enhanced home-based care, which consisted of the same intervention but with blood-pressure machines transmitting readings automatically (enhanced CHW group); or standard care with clinic-based management (standard-care group). The primary outcome was the systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were the systolic blood pressure at 12 months and hypertension control at 6 and 12 months. Safety outcomes included adverse events, deaths, and retention in care. A total of 774 adults underwent randomization. The mean age was 62 years; 76.0% of the participants were women, 13.6% had diabetes mellitus, and 46.5% had human immunodeficiency virus infection. The mean systolic blood pressure at 6 months was lower in the CHW group than in the standard-care group (difference, -7.9 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], -10.5 to -5.3; P<0.001) and was also lower in the enhanced CHW group than in the standard-care group (difference, -9.1 mm Hg; 95% CI, -11.7 to -6.4; P<0.001). The percentage of participants with hypertension control at 6 months was 57.6% in the standard-care group, as compared with 76.9% in the CHW group (relative risk, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.51) and 82.8% in the enhanced CHW group (relative risk, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.62).

The primary outcome was MACE; secondary outcomes included heart failure (HF) and kidney outcomes. Random-effects meta-analyses were followed by meta-regression evaluating associations with HbA1c and bodyweight reduction. A total of 73 263 individuals were included from 10 trials (ELIXA, LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, EXSCEL, Harmony Outcomes, PIONEER 6, REWIND, AMPLITUDE-O, FLOW, and SOUL). GLP-1RAs reduced MACE by 14% (hazard ratio: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.82 to 0.91; p <0.001), as well as hospitalisation for HF and the composite kidney outcome (both p <0.001). Meta-regression showed that every 1% extra reduction in HbA1c corresponded to a 27% lower HR for MACE (p = 0.015; R = 0.61). While HbA1c reduction was not significantly associated with secondary outcomes, the directionality was consistent with MACE. Bodyweight change was not associated with any of the analysed endpoints, including MACE (p = 0.13; R = 0.21). HbA1c reduction, not bodyweight change, was significantly and proportionally associated with MACE risk reduction. HbA1c lowering may serve as a useful surrogate for the cardiovascular improvements associated with GLP-1RAs in type 2 diabetes.",

The precision and focality of stimulation may influence therapeutic outcomes; thus, investigation of personalized focal high-definition (HD) tDCS for treating depression is needed.

The trial was conducted from December 1, 2020, to March 7, 2024, at UCLA. Each participant received a 4-week follow-up. Participants were required to meet diagnostic criteria for a current major depressive episode (evaluated using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview), present moderate to severe depressive symptoms (ie, have a 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAMD] score ≥14 and <24), be either treatment naive or receiving a stable standard antidepressant regimen, and be 18 to 65 years of age. Key exclusion criteria included treatment-resistant depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. Of 560 volunteers screened, 71 were found to be eligible for participation.

Aficamten, compared with placebo, lowered left ventricular outflow tract gradients (LVOT-G), improved measures of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, and showed evidence of favorable remodeling when added to standard of care medical therapy in SEQUOIA-HCM. The comparative effectiveness of monotherapy with aficamten vs metoprolol was investigated in MAPLE-HCM. This study evaluated the effect of monotherapy with aficamten compared with metoprolol on cardiac structure and function in participants enrolled in the MAPLE-HCM study. Serial echocardiograms and other clinical measures were collected over 24 weeks in participants receiving escalating doses of aficamten 5 to 20 mg or metoprolol 50 to 200 mg. The study enrolled 175 participants (mean age 58 ± 13 years, 42% women, 80% White, 14% Asian). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 68% ± 4% with resting and Valsalva LVOT-G of 47 ± 29 mm Hg and 74 ± 33 mm Hg, respectively. Compared with metoprolol, aficamten decreased resting LVOT-G (-30 mm Hg [95% CI: -37 to -23 mm Hg]; P < 0.001) and Valsalva LVOT-G (-35 mm Hg [95% CI: -44 to -26 mm Hg]; P < 0.001); reduced left atrial volume index (left atrial volume index -7.0 mL/m [95% CI: -9.1 to -4.8 mL/m]; P < 0.001); and improved E/e' (lateral E/e' -2.8 [95% CI: -4.0 to -1.6]; P < 0.001; septal E/e' -3.1 [95% CI: -4.5 to -1.7]; P < 0.001). Maximal wall thickness decreased (-1.0 mm [95% CI: -1.8 to -0.2 mm]; P = 0.02). LVEF, absolute LV global longitudinal strain, and absolute global circumferential strain decreased (LVEF -4% [95% CI: -5% to -3%]; global longitudinal strain -1.2% [95% CI: -1.8% to -0.5%]; global circumferential strain -2.5% [95% CI: -3.7% to -1.3%]; all P < 0.001) with no significant change in resting cardiac output between groups. Mitral valve systolic anterior motion and mitral regurgitation significantly decreased with aficamten at week 24. In addition to lowering Valsalva LVOT-G and left atrial volume index, treatment with aficamten compared with metoprolol over 24 weeks led to improvement in measures of LV diastolic function, mitral valve systolic anterior motion, and mitral regurgitation. Aficamten therapy resulted in modest reduction in LVEF compared with metoprolol. These exploratory findings further support the overall superiority of therapy with aficamten over metoprolol demonstrated in MAPLE-HCM with evidence of favorable changes in multiple echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and function in patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM.

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of tailored antiplatelet treatment with temporal modulation of the intensity of platelet inhibition in patients undergoing complex high-risk PCI. We randomly assigned 2018 patients with high-risk anatomical or clinical characteristics undergoing complex PCI to a tailored antiplatelet strategy with early escalation (low-dose ticagrelor at 60 mg twice daily plus aspirin <6 months) and late de-escalation (clopidogrel monotherapy >6 months) or dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin for 12 months). The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, stent thrombosis, unplanned urgent revascularization, and clinically relevant bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium Type 2, 3, or 5) at 12 months. The mean age was 64.0 years, 22.6% had left main PCI, 19.5% had complex bifurcation PCI, 84.1% had diffuse long lesions, 93.7% had multivessel PCI, and 36.7% had medically treated diabetes. At 12 months, a primary outcome event occurred in 105 patients (10.5%) assigned to tailored antiplatelet therapy and in 89 patients (8.8%) assigned to dual antiplatelet therapy [hazard ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.90-1.58; P = .21]. The incidence of major ischaemic events appeared to be similar in both groups. The incidence of clinically relevant bleeding at 12 months was 7.2% in the tailored-therapy group and 4.8% in the dual-therapy group (difference, 2.45% points; 95% CI, 0.37-4.53). Among high-risk patients undergoing complex PCI, tailored antiplatelet strategy with early escalation and late de-escalation, as compared with dual antiplatelet therapy, did not decrease the incidence of primary net adverse events at 12 months.

To evaluate the 52-week efficacy and safety of elinzanetant, a dual neurokinin-targeted therapy, for treating moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause. OASIS-3 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase 3 clinical trial that was conducted at 83 sites in North America and Europe from August 27, 2021, to February 12, 2024, and included postmenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years who were seeking treatment for moderate to severe VMS (no requirement for a minimum number of VMS events per week). The data were analyzed on March 11, 2024. Once-daily oral elinzanetant, 120 mg, or matching placebo for 52 weeks. The primary outcome was mean change from baseline to week 12 in the frequency of daily moderate to severe VMS, which was analyzed using a mixed model with repeated measures. Secondary end points included changes over 52 weeks in measures evaluating sleep disturbance and the effect on menopause-related quality of life. Exploratory end points included mean changes over 50 weeks in frequency and severity of daily moderate to severe VMS. Exploratory and secondary end points were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Safety was also assessed. Overall, 313 women (mean [SD] age, 54.6 [4.7] years; 51 [16.3%] were Black or African American, and 240 [76.7%] were White individuals; 34 [10.9%] were Hispanic or Latina) were randomized to receive elinzanetant and 315 (mean [SD] age, 54.9 [5.0] years; 44 [14.0%] Black or African American, 34 [10.8%] Hispanic or Latina, and 253 [80.3%] White individuals) to receive placebo. At week 12, the mean change from baseline in daily moderate to severe VMS frequency was -5.4 (95% CI, -6.3 to -4.5) for elinzanetant and -3.5 (95% CI, -4.1 to -2.9) for placebo; the least-squares mean difference for elinzanetant vs placebo was -1.6 (95% CI, -2.0 to -1.1; P < .001). Although no statistical hypotheses were defined, nor was the study powered to detect between-group differences for the secondary and exploratory end points, descriptive analyses showed numerical advantages for elinzanetant vs placebo for improving VMS frequency and severity over 50 weeks and sleep disturbances and menopause-related quality of life over 52 weeks. Regarding safety, elinzanetant was not associated with hepatotoxic effects, endometrial hyperplasia, or meaningful changes in bone density or bone turnover markers. Treatment-related adverse events were more common with elinzanetant than placebo (30.4% vs 14.6%); the most frequent were somnolence, fatigue, and headache. The OASIS-3 randomized clinical trial expanded on findings from the 26-week OASIS-1 and OASIS-2 trials, exploring the use of elinzanetant over a longer duration and in a broader population.

However, there are concerns regarding their association with serious gastrointestinal adverse events, although findings have been inconsistent. We systematically searched 5 databases for placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials assessing GLP-1RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, overweight/obesity, or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis/metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. We included trials that reported cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, cholangitis, cholestasis, pancreatitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastritis, esophagitis, gastrointestinal ischemia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intestinal obstruction, paralytic ileus, gastrointestinal ulceration, gastrointestinal perforation, or gastroparesis. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model, with subgroup analyses evaluating risks based on patient population, GLP-1RA vs dual-agonist formulation, weight-loss profile, dosing, and duration of action. We included 55 randomized controlled trials involving 106,395 participants. GLP-1RAs increased the risk of cholelithiasis (risk ratio [RR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.09-1.97; 2 more cases per 1000) and probably increased the risk of GERD (RR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.48-3.25; 4 more cases per 1000) compared with placebo. GLP-1RAs probably have little or no effect on the risk of other gastrointestinal or biliary events. Subgroup analyses showed that the increased risks of cholelithiasis and GERD were more pronounced in trials including individuals with overweight/obesity or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis/metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, weight-loss-inducing GLP-1RAs, or high-dose formulations, although these subgroup effects were not statistically significant. GLP-1RAs are associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis and GERD, but do not appear to increase the risk of other gastrointestinal or biliary adverse events.",

To assess risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to HT in women with VMS. In this secondary analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials of HT, postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years from 40 US clinical centers were included. Data were collected from November 1993 to September 2012, and data were analyzed from December 2024 to May 2025. Conjugated equine estrogens (CEE), 0.625 mg per day, or CEE with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 2.5 mg per day, vs placebo. Atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD; defined as composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for angina, coronary revascularization, ischemic stroke, peripheral arterial disease, carotid artery disease, or CVD death). Of 27 347 included postmenopausal women, the mean (SD) age was 63.4 (7.2) years; a total of 10 739 (39.3%) had a hysterectomy, and 16 608 (60.7%) had an intact uterus. The median (IQR) follow-up was 7.2 (6.4-8.1) years and 5.6 (4.8-6.5) years for those in the CEE alone trial and the CEE plus MPA trial, respectively. In the CEE alone trial, moderate or severe VMS were present at baseline in 905 (27.6%), 705 (14.7%), and 220 (8.7%) women aged 50 to 59 years, 60 to 69 years, and 70 to 79 years, respectively; in the CEE plus MPA trial, moderate or severe VMS was present in 1225 (22.4%), 649 (8.7%), and 172 (4.8%), respectively. Among women with moderate or severe VMS at enrollment, 3382 (96.7%) recalled having symptoms near menopause onset. CEE alone reduced VMS by 41% across all age groups (overall relative risk [RR], 0.59; 95% CI, 0.53-0.66). However, in the CEE plus MPA trial, VMS reduction was attenuated with age (age 50-59 years: RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.35-0.48; age 60-69 years: RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.61-0.85; age 70-79 years: RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.91-1.59; interaction P for trend < .001). Both CEE alone and CEE plus MPA appeared to have neutral effects on ASCVD in women with moderate or severe VMS aged 50 to 59 years (CEE alone: hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.53-1.35; CEE plus MPA: HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.44-1.57). While the estimated risk was higher for CEE alone in women with VMS aged 60 to 69 years, there was no clear signal of harm (CEE alone: HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.90-1.90; CEE plus MPA: HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.51-1.39). However, women with VMS 70 years and older had increased risks of ASCVD (CEE alone: HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.06-3.59; 217 excess events per 10 000 person-years; interaction P for trend = .03; CEE plus MPA: HR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.36-7.63; 382 excess events per 10 000 person-years; interaction P for trend = .02). In this secondary analysis of 2 randomized clinical trials, among younger postmenopausal women aged 50 to 59 years, both CEE alone and CEE plus MPA reduced VMS without significantly affecting ASCVD risk. In women with VMS 70 years and older, risks for ASCVD were increased in both trials. The findings support guideline recommendations for treatment of VMS with HT in women aged 50 to 59 years, caution if initiating HT in women aged 60 to 69 years, and avoidance of HT in women 70 years and older.

This prespecified analysis aimed to determine if the predicted risk of kidney disease progression, based on KDIGO risk categories, influenced the benefits and safety of this combination therapy. The double-blind, double-dummy trial randomized 818 adults with CKD and type 2 diabetes [urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥100 to <5000 mg/g] to receive once-daily finerenone plus empagliflozin, finerenone alone or empagliflozin alone, all in addition to a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor. The relative change in UACR from baseline to day 180 (primary endpoint) and a >30% reduction in UACR (secondary endpoint) across KDIGO risk categories was assessed. At baseline, among 781 with available data, 11.3% of participants were classified as low/moderate risk, 29.6% as high risk and 59.2% as very high risk. At 180 days, combination therapy significantly reduced UACR levels across all KDIGO risk categories (low/moderate: -61.7%; high: -60.7%; very high: -52.4%). This reduction was consistently greater than that achieved with either monotherapy alone. More than half of patients on combination therapy experienced UACR reductions of >30% (low/moderate: 58.1%; high: 74.2%; very high: 70.6%), again outperforming monotherapies across all risk groups. While hyperkalemia was more common with combination therapy, early eGFR declines (>30% within 30 days) were less frequent in individuals with higher KDIGO risk compared with lower risk. Overall, the safety profile of combination therapy remained consistent across all KDIGO risk categories, with no unexpected safety signals.

      "abstract": "Aldosterone dysregulation plays an important pathogenic role in hard-to-control hypertension. In several studies, baxdrostat, an aldosterone synthase inhibitor, reduced the seated systolic blood pressure of patients with uncontrolled or resistant hypertension. In this phase 3, multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients with a seated systolic blood pressure of between 140 mm Hg and less than 170 mm Hg despite the receipt of stable treatment with two antihypertensive medications (uncontrolled hypertension) or three or more such medications (resistant hypertension), including a diuretic. After a 2-week placebo run-in period, we randomly assigned patients with a seated systolic blood pressure of 135 mm Hg or more in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive baxdrostat at a dose of 1 mg, baxdrostat at a dose of 2 mg, or placebo once daily for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the change in seated systolic blood pressure from baseline to week 12. A total of 796 patients underwent randomization and 794 received 1-mg baxdrostat (264 patients), 2-mg baxdrostat (266 patients), or placebo (264 patients) in addition to background therapy. At 12 weeks, the change from baseline in the least-squares mean seated systolic blood pressure was -14.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], -16.5 to -12.5) with 1-mg baxdrostat, -15.7 mm Hg (95% CI, -17.6 to -13.7) with 2-mg baxdrostat, and -5.8 mm Hg (95% CI, -7.9 to -3.8) with placebo. The estimated difference from placebo (placebo-corrected difference) was -8.7 mm Hg (95% CI, -11.5 to -5.8) with 1-mg baxdrostat and -9.8 mm Hg (95% CI, -12.6 to -7.0) with 2-mg baxdrostat (P<0.001 for both comparisons). A potassium level of more than 6.0 mmol per liter was reported in 6 patients (2.3%) with 1-mg baxdrostat, in 8 patients (3.0%) with 2-mg baxdrostat, and in 1 patient (0.4%) with placebo. Among patients with uncontrolled or resistant hypertension, the addition of baxdrostat to background therapy resulted in a significantly lower seated systolic blood pressure at 12 weeks than placebo.

After a 2-week placebo run-in period, we randomly assigned patients with a seated systolic blood pressure of 135 mm Hg or more in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive baxdrostat at a dose of 1 mg, baxdrostat at a dose of 2 mg, or placebo once daily for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the change in seated systolic blood pressure from baseline to week 12."
