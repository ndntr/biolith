      "abstract": "The optimal duration of octreotide infusion for esophageal variceal bleeding remains unclear. We aimed to compare the efficacy of 1-day versus 5-day octreotide infusion combined with endoscopic therapy, with the primary outcome of early (5-day) re-bleeding under a non-inferiority framework and secondary outcomes of 6-week re-bleeding and all-cause mortality. This nationwide, multicenter, non-inferiority, open-label, randomized, controlled trial included 220 patients with cirrhosis and acute esophageal variceal bleeding who underwent endoscopic band ligation in five tertiary-care and three university-based hospitals across Thailand. They received a 1-day (n=109) or 5-day (n=111) regimen of continuous octreotide infusion after successful endoscopy. Re-bleeding, transfusion requirements, and mortality were assessed. The majority of participants were men (180/220), and the average age was 56 years. The 5-day re-bleeding (1.83% vs. 1.80%, p≥0.99), 6-week re-bleeding (8.26% vs. 10.81%, p=0.52), and 6-week all-cause mortality (5.50% vs. 6.31%, p=0.80) rates were similar between the 1- and 5-day groups. The event-rate difference in early re-bleeding was 0.03%, indicating non-inferiority (95% CI, 3.50-3.56%). Patients in the 1-day group required significantly fewer blood transfusions and had a shorter time to oral diet and shorter hospital stay. Following successful endoscopic band ligation, the 1-day regimen of octreotide had a non-inferior effect compared to the standard 5-day regimen in the prevention of 5-day re-bleeding and exhibited no significant differences in the prevention of 6-week re-bleeding and all-cause mortality.",

We aimed to examine the clinical efficacy and safety of maintenance inhaled corticosteroids plus budesonide-formoterol reliever or terbutaline reliever in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma. This open-label, parallel-group, randomised, controlled, phase 4 trial was conducted at Wellington Hospital and two community-based primary care facilities in New Zealand. Eligible participants were aged 16-75 years, had a self-reported doctor's diagnosis of asthma, were using reliever only therapy or maintenance inhaled corticosteroids with short-acting β2-agonist reliever therapy, and were registered with a general practitioner. Participants had to have reported mean reliever use on two or more occasions per week in the 12 weeks before enrolment and had evidence of airway inflammation (FeNO ≥25 parts per billion [ppb]) at screening. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to budesonide-formoterol (budesonide 200 μg and formoterol 6 μg) reliever or terbutaline 250 μg reliever therapy using a computer-generated sequence in block sizes of four and six, stratified by region, baseline inhaled corticosteroids maintenance dose, and history of severe asthma exacerbation in the previous 12 months.

      "abstract": "Emergency Medical Services (EMS) patients with chest pain are often suspected of having non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). Current risk stratification protocols for NSTE-ACS have limitations, leading to a lack of a well-organised prehospital diagnostic pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated that using clinical risk scores (CRS) including point-of-care (POC)-troponin in the EMS can improve prehospital diagnostic pathways for suspected NSTE-ACS. The primary aim of this systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis was to assess safety of low-risk stratification for suspected NSTE-ACS patients in the prehospital setting. Prospective studies using CRS or POC-troponin for risk stratification in suspected NSTE-ACS patients within the EMS setting were included. Safety was assessed using sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) for patients identified as low risk, based on CRS or POC-troponin measurement, for three different endpoints within 30 days: (1) all-cause mortality, (2) composite of mortality and/or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), (3) major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Of 1526 articles screened, 6 were included, comprising 5.239 patients, and all utilised CRS derived from the History, ECG, Age, Risk-factor and Troponin (HEART) score. The summary of low-risk CRS diagnostic performance predicted all-cause mortality with a sensitivity of 93.2% (83.5-98.1) and NPV of 99.8% (99.5-99.9); mortality and/or AMI with a sensitivity of 91.8% (83.0-96.2) and an NPV of 97.3% (89.9-99.3); and MACE with a sensitivity of 92.8% (88.7-95.5) and an NPV of 97.2% (92.1-99.0). Lowering the CRS cut-off value for identifying low-risk patients increased sensitivity and NPV but decreased the proportion of patients classified as low risk. In well-trained EMS systems, where prompt and accurate follow-up of low-risk patients is possible, HEART-derived CRS effectively identify patients with a very low risk of 30-day mortality and MACE. However, implementation in other healthcare systems requires additional validation, given the variations in healthcare structure, risk stratification processes and follow-up capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Reducing blood loss at the time of scheduled cesarean improves maternal outcomes. Type of suture material and closure technique may contribute to reduction in blood loss specifically related to the incision site as well as more expeditiously achieve uterine contractility. Prior publications have noted reduced closure times when using knotless barbed suture, but available evidence remains limited. To examine whether patients whose hysterotomies were closed with Stratafix barbed suture at the time of scheduled cesarean delivery had lower quantified blood loss compared to patients who received Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture. This was a prospective randomized clinical trial at a single tertiary care center in New York City. Patients with a scheduled primary or repeat cesarean delivery ≥37.0 weeks' gestation provided informed consent and were randomized to either Stratafix barbed suture or Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture for hysterotomy closure. The primary outcome was quantified blood loss, measured in milliliters using the mobile Stryker Triton artificial intelligence scanner. Secondary outcomes included (1) single-layer hysterotomy closure time, (2) use of additional hemostatic sutures, (3) intraoperative use of hemostatic agents, (4) rate of surgical site infection (including endometritis), and (5) differences in average postoperative pain. The Mann-Whitney U test compared observed medians of continuous outcomes between groups. Chi-squared tests compared proportional differences in categorical outcomes between groups. An a posteriori multivariable quantile regression model examined whether continuous outcomes differed when controlling for suspected confounders. Between July 20, 2021 and November 30, 2023, 226 patients were randomized to either Stratafix barbed suture (n=113) or Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture (n=113) at the time of scheduled cesarean delivery. We observed no significant difference between the median quantified blood loss observed in the Stratafix barbed suture group (544.5 [250.7-838.8] mL) and the Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture group (600 [348-852] mL; P=.22). Median time to hysterotomy closure was 1.3 minutes shorter in the Stratafix barbed suture group (4.1[2.6-5.6] minutes) and the Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture group (5.4 [3.5-7.2] minutes; P<.001). In an a posteriori multivariable quantile regression adjusting for confounders, the median total quantified blood loss was not statistically significantly different between groups (P=.37). Median time to hysterotomy closure was 1.8 minutes shorter for the Stratafix barbed suture group (P<.01). The use of Stratafix barbed sutures was not associated with a reduction in blood loss compared with the Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture. However, the results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that Stratafix barbed suture may be associated with faster single-layer hysterotomy closure time. This suggests that Stratafix barbed suture could have benefits over Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture for the single-layer closure of hysterotomy during cesarean delivery. Any possible benefits of using Stratafix barbed suture at the time of hysterotomy closure during scheduled cesarean require further exploration.",

The primary outcome was quantified blood loss, measured in milliliters using the mobile Stryker Triton artificial intelligence scanner. Secondary outcomes included (1) single-layer hysterotomy closure time, (2) use of additional hemostatic sutures, (3) intraoperative use of hemostatic agents, (4) rate of surgical site infection (including endometritis), and (5) differences in average postoperative pain. The Mann-Whitney U test compared observed medians of continuous outcomes between groups. Chi-squared tests compared proportional differences in categorical outcomes between groups. An a posteriori multivariable quantile regression model examined whether continuous outcomes differed when controlling for suspected confounders."

However, the results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that Stratafix barbed suture may be associated with faster single-layer hysterotomy closure time. This suggests that Stratafix barbed suture could have benefits over Vicryl (Polyglactin 910) suture for the single-layer closure of hysterotomy during cesarean delivery. Any possible benefits of using Stratafix barbed suture at the time of hysterotomy closure during scheduled cesarean require further exploration."

Changes between semaglutide and placebo groups over 26 weeks in total daily insulin dose (TDD), basal and bolus insulin doses, carbohydrate intake, and user-initiated bolus counts were analyzed using linear mixed models. Mediation analysis was used to attribute direct effects of semaglutide versus weight loss on insulin dose reduction. From baseline to week 26, there was a significant 22.6% reduction in TDD (95% CI -28.3 to -17.0), which was driven by greater reductions in bolus insulin (-30.5%; 95% CI -39.5 to -21.5) than basal insulin (-15.6%; 95% CI -21.5 to -9.7). The basal/TDD ratio increased from 0.56 to 0.62 (P < 0.001) and insulin dose (in units/kg/day) decreased from 0.72 to 0.60 (P < 0.001) in the semaglutide group. At week 4, an 83% (-11.1 U/day) reduction in TDD was due to a direct drug effect, and 17% (-2.3 U/day) was attributed to weight loss, whereas at week 26, the difference was split evenly between direct effect (-11.4 U/day; 52%) and weight loss (-10.5 U/day; 48%). Daily carbohydrate intake decreased from 137 g (95% CI 107-167) at baseline to 107 g (95% CI 76-137) at 26 weeks. Semaglutide produced rapid, sustained, and primarily bolus-driven insulin dose reductions, with early effects being largely independent of weight loss in adults with T1D and obesity.",

      "abstract": "Adolescent obesity is a global public health problem with multiple causes. The mainstay approach for managing obesity includes interventions targeting changes in health-related behaviours (diet, physical activity, and behaviour). However, previous research highlighted uncertainty about the sustainability and long-term results of these approaches. To assess the effects of multimodal health behaviour-changing interventions for adolescents aged 10 to 19 living with obesity. We used CENTRAL, MEDLINE, three other databases, and two trial registers, together with reference checking and contact with study authors, to identify studies included in the review. The latest search date was 28 February 2024. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adolescents aged 10 to 19 living with obesity that compared interventions involving a minimum of two health-related behaviour components (modifications in diet, physical activity, or behavioural change) to control (including no treatment, usual care, or waiting-list control) with a minimum of one year of follow-up. Critical outcomes included physical well-being, mental well-being, physical activity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), obesity-associated disability, adverse events, and anthropometry (body mass index (BMI) z-score). We used the original version of the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias (RoB 1). We synthesised results for each outcome using meta-analysis, where possible, with a random-effects model. Where this was not possible, we described the results narratively. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for critical outcomes included in two key summary of findings tables. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMD). We included 33 RCTs with 5949 participants aged 10 to 19, primarily from high-income countries. We included 13 community-based interventions in schools, churches, and community centres, and 20 healthcare-based interventions implemented in primary care and hospitals. Intervention components included sessions on dietary modification, physical activity, and behavioural change. Of the 33 included studies, one targeted parents only, one involved only adolescents, and the remainder used family-based approaches, primarily through individual or group sessions. Healthcare-based multimodal interventions versus control Healthcare-based multimodal interventions may result in little to no difference in physical well-being at 12 months of follow-up (multiple scales: SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.39; I² = 67%; 4 studies, 1006 participants; low-certainty evidence). They may result in little to no difference in mental well-being at 12 to 18 months of follow-up (multiple scales: SMD 0.09, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.24; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 693 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of these interventions on self-reported physical activity (final score) at 12 months (multiple scales: SMD 0.51, 95% CI -0.07 to 1.10; I² = 93%; 4 studies, 964 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and when measured as a change-from-baseline score, these interventions may result in little to no difference in self-reported physical activity (multiple scales: SMD 0.02, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.34; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 156 participants; low-certainty evidence). These interventions may slightly improve HRQoL at 12 months (multiple scales: SMD 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.24; I² = 4%; 7 studies, 1454 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of healthcare-based multimodal interventions on adverse events (0 events; 1 study, 46 participants; very low-certainty evidence). These interventions may result in little to no difference in BMI z-score at 12 to 18 months (MD -0.11, 95% CI -0.19 to -0.02; I² = 78%; 17 studies, 2666 participants; low-certainty evidence) and 24 months (MD 0.50, 95% CI -0.35 to 1.35; I² not applicable; 1 study, 33 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported obesity-associated disability. Community-based multimodal interventions versus control Community-based multimodal interventions may improve physical well-being at 12 months of follow-up (Youth Quality of Life instrument - Weight module: MD 13.50, 95% CI 4.99 to 22.01; I² not applicable; 1 study, 136 participants; low-certainty evidence). These interventions may result in little to no difference in mental well-being at 12 months (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire: MD 1.20, 95% CI -0.46 to 2.86; I² not applicable; 1 study, 208 participants; low-certainty evidence). These interventions may result in little to no difference in self-reported physical activity at 24 months (Global Physical Activity Questionnaire: ß coefficient = -0.04, 95% CI -0.3 to 0.2; P = 0.76; low-certainty evidence). Community-based multimodal interventions likely result in little to no difference in HRQoL at 12 months (multiple scales: SMD 0.06, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.24; I² = 19%; 4 studies, 666 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and may result in little to no difference in HRQoL at 24 months (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory: SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.27; I² not applicable; 1 study, 188 participants; low-certainty evidence). These interventions may result in little to no difference in BMI z-score at 12 months (MD -0.07, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.08; I² = 85%; 5 studies, 585 participants; low-certainty evidence), and may reduce BMI z-score slightly at 24 months of follow-up (MD -0.47, 95% CI -0.96 to 0.02; I² = 98%; 3 studies, 430 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported data on obesity-associated disability or adverse events. Multimodal health behaviour-changing interventions may result in a small improvement in physical well-being at 12 months and BMI z-score at 12 months when delivered in the community, and in HRQoL at 12 months when delivered in healthcare settings. They may have little to no effect on other pre-defined critical outcomes, including mental well-being and physical activity. Future research should consider innovative approaches to the care of adolescents living with obesity and involve diverse populations, as we found limited research conducted in disadvantaged and culturally/ethnically diverse populations and other low-resource settings.

          "text": "Multimodal health behaviour-changing interventions may result in a small improvement in physical well-being at 12 months and BMI z-score at 12 months when delivered in the community, and in HRQoL at 12 months when delivered in healthcare settings. They may have little to no effect on other pre-defined critical outcomes, including mental well-being and physical activity. Future research should consider innovative approaches to the care of adolescents living with obesity and involve diverse populations, as we found limited research conducted in disadvantaged and culturally/ethnically diverse populations and other low-resource settings."

However, most treatments focus on symptom reduction without addressing the underlying biopsychosocial needs of patients. To determine the effectiveness of spinal manipulation and clinician-supported biopsychosocial self-management vs medical care for adults with increased risk of chronic disabling LBP. This 2 × 2 factorial randomized clinical trial enrolled participants in 3 research clinics at the Universities of Minnesota and Pittsburgh from November 2018 to May 2023; final follow-up was in June 2024. Adults with acute or subacute LBP at moderate to high risk of chronicity based on the STarT Back tool were randomized to 1 of 4 groups, with interventions lasting up to 8 weeks. Statistical analysis was conducted from November 2024 to June 2025. Spinal manipulation therapy (n = 201), supported self-management (n = 305), or combined supported self-management with spinal manipulation (n = 193) compared with guideline-based medical care (n = 301). Physical therapists and chiropractors provided spinal manipulation and supported self-management. The 2 primary outcomes averaged over a follow-up of 1 year were monthly low back disability (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) and weekly pain intensity (numerical rating scale). Secondary analysis examined the proportion of participants achieving a 50% or higher reduction in the primary outcome measures. Among the 1000 participants randomized (mean [SD] age, 47 [16] years; 58% female), 93% completed the trial. The omnibus test for differences across the 4 treatment groups was statistically significant for disability (P = .001; supported self-management, 4.7; spinal manipulation, 5.5; combined supported self-management with spinal manipulation, 4.8; medical care, 5.9) but not pain intensity (P = .16; supported self-management, 2.8; spinal manipulation, 3.0; combined supported self-management with spinal manipulation, 2.8; medical care, 3.0). Averaged over 12 months, LBP disability was significantly lower compared with medical care for supported self-management (mean difference, -1.2 [95% CI, -1.9 to -0.5]) and supported self-management with spinal manipulation (mean difference, -1.1 [95% CI, -1.9 to -0.3]) but not spinal manipulation alone (mean difference, -0.4 [95% CI, -1.2 to 0.4]).

This study examines whether the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 (LS7) metric developed for cardiovascular health is also linked to mortality outcomes in cancer survivors and explores potential biological mechanisms underlying this relationship. Longitudinal analyses were conducted on 779 cancer survivors from the Moli-sani study (n = 24 325), followed for 14.6 years (median). The LS7 metric includes smoking, physical activity, diet, body mass index, blood pressure, total blood cholesterol, and glucose. Each ideal metric was assigned 2 points, with scores ranging from 0 to 14. The LS7 score was categorized as poor (0-6), intermediate (7-9), and ideal (10-14) cardiovascular health. Shared biological risk factors (e.g. inflammatory and renal markers) were analysed as potential mediators. Cancer survivors in the ideal cardiovascular health category had a 38% lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to those with poor cardiovascular health [hazard ratio (HR) .62; 95% confidence interval (CI) .41-.94]. Similar findings were observed in cancer-free participants (HR .68; 95% CI .59-.78). Each 1-unit increase in LS7 metric was linked to lower cancer mortality (HR .90; 95% CI .82-.98). Replacing the original dietary component of the LS7 with the Mediterranean diet score resulted in reduced hazards of CVD (HR .84; 95% CI .71-1.00), cancer (HR .90; 95% CI .83-.98), and non-CVD/non-cancer mortality (e.g. deaths from neurodegenerative, cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases) (HR .83; 95% CI .70-.98). Altogether, inflammation, heart rate, and serum vitamin D accounted for over 50% of the associations between LS7 metric and mortality. The LS7 metric, originally developed for cardiovascular health, is associated with lower all-cause and cancer mortality in cancer survivors, potentially through shared biological mechanisms. These findings support the inclusion of LS7 risk factors in public health efforts targeting both CVD and cancer outcomes.",

Children aged 6 to 17 years presenting with a nonoperative acute limb injury (<24 hours) and a verbal numerical rating scale (vNRS) pain score of 5 or more out of 10 were enrolled. Date of final follow-up was March 22, 2023. The opioid trial randomized participants to a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus hydromorphone, ibuprofen plus acetaminophen, or ibuprofen alone. The nonopioid trial randomized participants to a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus acetaminophen or ibuprofen alone. In all groups, ibuprofen was dosed at 10 mg/kg (maximum, 600 mg). The acetaminophen dose was 15 mg/kg (maximum, 1000 mg), and the hydromorphone dose was 0.05 mg/kg (maximum, 5 mg). The primary efficacy outcome was self-reported vNRS pain score at 60 minutes post medication administration (score range, 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst pain]; minimal clinically important difference, 1.5).

      "abstract": "The cardiac myosin inhibitor aficamten was significantly more effective than metoprolol at improving exercise tolerance in MAPLE-HCM (Metoprolol vs Aficamten in Patients with LVOT Obstruction on Exercise Capacity in HCM), a head-to-head, international, double-blind, randomized trial in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM). Given the primary treatment goal to improve patients' health status, defining the incremental benefits of aficamten over metoprolol on patients' symptoms, function, and quality of life is needed. In this study, the authors sought to compare patient-reported health status benefits of aficamten with metoprolol. Adults with symptomatic oHCM (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ] Clinical Summary Score [CSS] ≤90; left ventricular outflow tract obstruction ≥30 mm Hg at rest or ≥50 mm Hg with Valsalva) were randomly assigned to 24 weeks of aficamten or metoprolol as monotherapy. Changes in KCCQ Overall Summary Score (OSS) and Seattle Angina Questionnaire Summary Score (SAQ-SS), collected serially throughout the trial, were compared between treatment groups at 24 weeks using linear regression, adjusted for randomization strata and baseline scores. Individual participant experiences were described by comparing categories of clinically meaningful within-participant change: ≤-5 (worse), >-5 to <+5 (no change), +5 to <+10 (small improvement), +10 to <+15 (moderate improvement), +15 to <+20 (large improvement), and ≥+20 points (very large improvement). Among 175 randomized patients, baseline health status scores were similar between treatment groups (n = 88 aficamten; n = 87 metoprolol). Aficamten, compared with metoprolol, resulted in a greater 24-week KCCQ-OSS improvement (adjusted between-group difference: +7.8 points; 95% CI: 3.3-12.3; P < 0.001), primarily driven by a greater proportion of aficamten-treated (38.6%) vs metoprolol-treated (18.4%) patients experiencing a very large (≥20 points) KCCQ-OSS improvement (number needed to treat = 4.9; 95% CI: 3.0-13.9), and a smaller proportion experiencing worsening health status (≤-5-point change: 6.8% vs 18.4%; number needed to harm = 8.6; 95% CI: 4.7-53.3). Nonsignificant SAQ-SS improvements with aficamten vs metoprolol (+4.6 points; 95% CI -0.3 to 9.5 points; P = 0.063) were driven by significantly larger improvements in the SAQ Physical Limitation scale (+10.1 points; 95% CI: 3.9-16.2 points; P = 0.001). Aficamten improved the health status of patients with symptomatic oHCM significantly more than did metoprolol, highlighting its potential as an effective initial therapeutic option.

Multicentre, assessor blinded, cluster randomised clinical trial. 28 French hospitals, 19 January 2016 to 16 December 2021. Index cases; adults and children weighing >15 kg with scabies, confirmed by dermoscopy. Index cases were randomly assigned to the ivermectin group or permethrin group (1:1 ratio). Each member of the cluster, defined as the household of each index case, received the same treatment as the index case, except for children weighing <15 kg who were prescribed topical 5% permethrin. All participants received oral ivermectin 200 µg/kg or 5% permethrin cream on day 0 and day 10. Permethrin cream was applied to the whole body, from head to toe. The primary outcome was clinical cure of the cluster on day 28 (ie, disappearance of clinical signs and symptoms of scabies for all cluster members). Secondary outcomes were index case and individual level analyses and safety. Dermatologists were used as assessors and were masked to the treatment. 507 participants in 142 households (clusters) were treated with ivermectin and 568 participants in 147 households received permethrin. Cluster level cure rates were 71.8% versus 88.5% (-16.7 percentage point difference, 95% confidence interval (CI) -26.3 to -7.1) for ivermectin versus permethrin. Secondary outcome percentage point differences also showed the inferiority of ivermectin compared with 5% permethrin for index cases (76.6%  91.5%; percentage point difference -14.9, 95% CI -23.6 to -6.2) and participants (85.3%  94.2%; -9.2 percentage point difference, -14.9 to -3.5). Intraclass correlation coefficients were higher for permethrin than ivermectin for all clusters (0.68, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.75  0.46, 0.37 to 0.56) and for cluster size >1 (0.67, 0.60 to 0.74  0.47, 0.37 to 0.56). Cutaneous adverse events were found in 11.9% and 15.6% of participants treated with ivermectin and permethrin, respectively. The results of this cluster randomised trial of classic scabies, confirmed by dermoscopy, did not show the non-inferiority of oral ivermectin compared with 5% permethrin cream, given on days 0 and 10, in achieving clinical cure of scabies on day 28 in index cases and their household members. Conversely, the trial showed the statistical superiority of 5% permethrin cream. NCT02407782.",

Reperfusion therapy aims to rapidly relieve acute RV pressure overload and to normalize hemodynamics. STORM-PE (A Prospective, Multicenter, Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluating Anticoagulation Alone Versus Anticoagulation Plus Mechanical Aspiration With the Indigo Aspiration System for the Treatment of Intermediate-High Risk Acute Pulmonary Embolism) is the first reported randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy and to evaluate the safety of mechanical thrombectomy, specifically computer-assisted vacuum thrombectomy (CAVT) with anticoagulation compared to anticoagulation alone. STORM-PE is an international randomized controlled trial with 1:1 randomization to CAVT with anticoagulation or anticoagulation alone. Eligible adults had acute-onset (symptoms ≤14 days), intermediate-high risk PE and were normotensive, with an RV/LV ratio ≥1.0 on computed tomographic pulmonary angiography and elevated cardiac biomarkers. The primary end-point analysis tested for a difference between groups for the change in RV/LV ratio at 48 hours, assessed by a blinded independent imaging core laboratory. Secondary end points included major adverse events within 7 days (a composite of clinical deterioration necessitating rescue therapy, PE-related mortality, symptomatic recurrent PE, and major bleeding), adjudicated by an external clinical events committee. Additional outcomes included change in vital signs and core laboratory-assessed pulmonary artery obstruction at 48 hours. A total of 100 patients enrolled across 22 sites were randomized to CAVT (n=47) or anticoagulation alone (n=53). Baseline characteristics were comparable between arms. At 48 hours, mean reduction in RV/LV ratio was greater for CAVT (0.52±0.37) than anticoagulation (0.24±0.40), a difference of 0.27 (95% CI, 0.12-0.43; <0.001). Refined modified and modified Miller scores exhibited greater changes for CAVT than anticoagulation alone at 48 hours (<0.001). Early normalization of vital signs within 48 hours was more frequent after CAVT. The major adverse event rate within 7 days was not different between groups (CAVT, 4.3% versus anticoagulation, 7.5%; =0.681). Two PE-related deaths occurred in the CAVT arm. CAVT was superior to anticoagulation alone in reducing RV/LV ratio within 48 hours in patients with intermediate-high risk PE, accompanied by earlier normalization of vital signs and major adverse event rates comparable to those for anticoagulation.
