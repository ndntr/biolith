To investigate whether precision immunotherapy guided by the presence of macrophage activation-like syndrome or sepsis-induced immunoparalysis improves organ dysfunction by day 9. A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in 6 countries. Patients with sepsis, defined by Sepsis-3, were included if they had community-acquired or hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia or bacteremia and sepsis and had displayed either macrophage activation-like syndrome (blood ferritin >4420 ng/mL) or sepsis-induced immunoparalysis (blood ferritin ≤4420 ng/mL and <5000 human leukocyte antigen DR receptors on CD45/CD14 monocytes). The first patient was enrolled August 5, 2021, and the last follow-up, April 29, 2024. Eligible patients were randomized to receive standard care and precision immunotherapy or standard care and placebo. Those in the precision immunotherapy group with macrophage activation-like syndrome received anakinra intravenously (IV) and placebo subcutaneously, and those with sepsis-induced immunoparalysis received subcutaneous recombinant human interferon gamma and IV placebo. Those in the placebo group received both IV and subcutaneous placebo. Treatment was administered for up to 15 days. The primary end point was a decrease of at least 1.4 points in the mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score from baseline by day 9. The SOFA score evaluates 6 organ systems, ranging from 0, no dysfunction, to 4, failure, and the total score ranges from 0, normal, to 24, most severe form of multiorgan failure. Key secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality. Of 672 patients assessed for eligibility, 281 were randomized and 276 were included in the primary analysis population (mean [SD] age, 70 [13] years; 93 females [33.7%]; median baseline SOFA score, 9 [IQR, 7-11]). The SOFA decrease end point was attained by 46 of 131 patients (35.1%) in the precision immunotherapy group and by 26 of 145 patients (17.9%) in the placebo group (difference, 17.2% [95% CI, 6.8% to 27.2%]; P = .002). Mortality at 28 days was not statistically significantly different between groups. A total of 1069 serious treatment-emergent adverse events (88.8%) were reported; increased incidence of anemia was noted in the anakinra group; and hemorrhage in the recombinant human interferon gamma group. Among patients with sepsis, precision immunotherapy targeting macrophage activation-like syndrome and sepsis-induced immunoparalysis improved organ dysfunction by day 9 compared with placebo.

      "abstract": "Acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common bacterial infections in children worldwide, and the most common reason for prescribing antibiotics. Although serious complications (e.g. mastoiditis or meningitis) are rare, the infection causes acute pain and can lead to hearing impairment. Since AOM often resolves spontaneously, current treatment guidelines recommend an approach of watchful waiting (no initial antibiotics). However, decongestants and antihistamines, administered orally or nasally, might reduce inflammation and mucosal oedema in the middle ear and help resolve AOM in children. To assess the benefits and harms of decongestants and antihistamines in treating acute otitis media in children. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov in February 2025. We checked reference lists of relevant articles for additional studies. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with children (from any setting) with AOM. Eligible comparisons were decongestants versus no intervention or placebo, antihistamines versus no intervention or placebo, decongestants plus antihistamines versus no intervention or placebo, decongestants versus antihistamines, one decongestant versus another, and one antihistamine versus another. The route of administration could be oral or nasal. Our critical outcomes were presence of AOM within seven days from starting treatment, severe complications (e.g. mastoiditis, meningitis, sinus thrombosis, facial paralysis, labyrinthitis), any adverse events (e.g. drowsiness), otalgia (yes/no) within seven days from starting treatment, and otalgia (score) within seven days from starting treatment. Our important outcomes included the presence of otitis media with effusion (OME) within 10 to 14 days from starting treatment. Two review authors used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2) to independently assess risk of bias. We used standard Cochrane methods. We evaluated the benefits and harms using a random-effects model, calculating risk ratios (RRs) and risk differences (RDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes. Where the results could not be pooled due to the nature of the data, we described them narratively. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We identified 15 studies (3066 participants) conducted in the USA (11 studies), Denmark (2 studies), Canada (1 study), and the UK (1 study), and published between 1965 and 2003. In 12 studies, the children's ages ranged from three months to 15 years. One study also included a few adults aged up to 40 years, and one study may have also included adults aged 18 years. Participants received concomitant antibiotics in 12 studies. Four studies evaluated decongestants versus placebo or no intervention. Four studies evaluated antihistamines versus placebo or no intervention. Two studies contained three parallel treatment arms (decongestants versus antihistamines versus placebo). Three studies compared combinations of decongestants and antihistamines to placebo or no intervention. Two studies contained four parallel treatment arms (combinations of decongestants and antihistamines versus decongestants versus antihistamines versus placebo). Decongestants versus placebo or no intervention 1. No studies reported the presence of AOM within seven days. 2. Evidence from one study suggests that decongestants may result in little to no difference in severe complications compared to no intervention (no events; low-certainty evidence). 3. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of decongestants on any adverse events compared to placebo (RR 3.60, 95% CI 0.16 to 83.28; I² = 71%; 3 studies, 296 participants; very low-certainty evidence). 4. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of decongestants on otalgia within seven days compared to placebo (RR 3.24, 95% CI 0.14 to 75.91; 1 study, 50 participants; very low-certainty evidence). 5. No studies reported an otalgia score within seven days. 6. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of decongestants on the presence of OME within 10 to 14 days compared to placebo (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.29; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 239 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Another study, excluded from the meta-analysis, reported OME at 14 days after starting treatment, with 46/101 events in the decongestant group and 34/94 events in the placebo group. The certainty of evidence was low to very low mainly due to study limitations (risk of bias), inconsistency, and imprecision. Antihistamines versus placebo or no intervention 1. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of antihistamines on the presence of AOM within seven days compared to placebo (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.36; 1 study, 90 participants; very low-certainty evidence). 2. Evidence from one study suggests that antihistamines may result in little to no difference in severe complications compared to no intervention (no events; low-certainty evidence). 3. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of antihistamines on any adverse events compared to placebo (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.37 to 133.12; I² = not applicable; 2 studies, 192 participants; very low-certainty evidence). 4. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of antihistamines on otalgia within seven days compared to placebo (RR 3.52, 95% CI 0.15 to 82.34; 1 study, 48 participants; very low-certainty evidence). 5. No studies reported an otalgia score within seven days. 6. Antihistamines may result in little to no difference in the presence of OME within 10 to 14 days compared to placebo (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.45, I² = 0%; 3 studies, 439 participants; low-certainty evidence). The certainty of evidence was low to very low, mainly due to study limitations (risk of bias) and imprecision. The evidence is very uncertain about the benefits and harms of oral or nasal decongestants or antihistamines for children with AOM. No relevant trials have been published since 2003. No studies are ongoing. This Cochrane review received no dedicated funding. Protocol (2023): doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015839.",

The hip joints are some of the most commonly affected in OA. Hip OA is also known as coxarthrosis. This study aimed to compare the effects of conventional radiofrequency (RF) to those of intraarticular steroid treatment methods on pain, limitations, and quality of life in patients who had advanced OA of the hip and could not undergo surgery for any reason. The study was designed as a randomized, prospective single-center study. A total of 40 patients with advanced primary hip OA who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. Patients were randomized into 2 groups, each of which included 20 individuals. One group received conventional (thermal) radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to the femoral and obturator sensory branches of the hip, while the other group received intraarticular steroid injections in their hips. Scores on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and the physical-function component of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were completed before, one month after, and 3 months after the procedure. The VAS was recorded both at rest and during activity. Each patient's gender, body mass index (BMI), affected hip side, duration of pain, and previous treatments for the hip were recorded, as were the procedure-related complications each patient experienced. Forty patients were followed up on for 3 months. The analysis revealed that at both one month and 3 months after treatment, the 2 groups of patients showed a significant improvement in their scores on the resting VAS, activity VAS, and physical-function component of the SF-36 from the pre-procedure values (P < 0.05). As for resting VAS scores in the hip intraarticular steroid injection (HIASI) group and activity VAS scores in the thermal radiofrequency ablation (TRFA) group, there was a statistically significant difference between the groups at one month and 3 months after the procedure, respectively (P < 0.05). This study found a statistically significant correlation between hip stage and age, but no significant correlation was found for gender and weight. No difference between the groups appeared in the complications related to the procedure at the 3-month follow-up. The follow-up period was relatively short. The sample size was small, and to avoid neuritis, a half dose of triamcinolone acetonide was given to the patients in the TRFA group. Conventional RF is more effective at treating the symptoms of advanced coxarthrosis than are intraarticular steroids, based on observations of the activity in the 3-month follow-up of patients with the condition.",

The analysis revealed that at both one month and 3 months after treatment, the 2 groups of patients showed a significant improvement in their scores on the resting VAS, activity VAS, and physical-function component of the SF-36 from the pre-procedure values (P < 0.05). As for resting VAS scores in the hip intraarticular steroid injection (HIASI) group and activity VAS scores in the thermal radiofrequency ablation (TRFA) group, there was a statistically significant difference between the groups at one month and 3 months after the procedure, respectively (P < 0.05). This study found a statistically significant correlation between hip stage and age, but no significant correlation was found for gender and weight. No difference between the groups appeared in the complications related to the procedure at the 3-month follow-up."

      "abstract": "This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders on the management of functional seizures. Following a National Academy of Medicine-compliant process, a multidisciplinary panel conducted a systematic review and integrated the findings with the authors' clinical experience to develop recommendations. A systematic review of the available evidence from first published articles to February 25, 2025, identified 12 Class II-III studies. The review found that psychological interventions are possibly effective in increasing the likelihood of achieving freedom from functional seizures, decreasing the frequency of functional seizures, decreasing anxiety, and improving health-related quality of life and psychosocial functioning for individuals with functional seizures. Key recommendations state that, when evaluating patients with seizure-like episodes, clinicians should seek historical and semiological information (including smartphone videos) from both patients and witnesses and may obtain video-EEG of all typical seizure-like episodes where feasible. Clinicians should evaluate patients diagnosed with functional seizures for co-occurring psychiatric disorders and co-occurring epilepsy. Clinicians should adhere to universal standards of care for patients, including speaking respectfully, refraining from unnecessary harm, and avoiding stigmatizing behavior. Clinicians should provide a specific diagnostic label and rationale for the diagnosis, should engage in shared decision making regarding the treatment plan, and should provide continuity of care to individuals diagnosed with functional seizures. When psychological interventions for functional seizures are indicated, clinicians should counsel patients regarding the potential benefits and risks of these interventions and should refer interested and appropriate patients to these interventions for the treatment of functional seizures. Clinicians should involve family, caregivers, or others in the social support network in the psychological treatment of individuals with functional seizures. Clinicians should not prescribe benzodiazepines or antiseizure medications for patients with functional seizures without co-occurring epilepsy or another indication for these medications and should counsel patients regarding the potential risks and lack of evidence of benefit for using these medications for functional seizures. Clinicians should taper off antiseizure medications for patients with functional seizures and without another indication for these medications. The guideline also identifies gaps in the available evidence and outlines potentially clinically impactful avenues for future research.",

      "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) as adjunctive therapies for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and overweight or obesity. A literature search was conducted in June 2023 and updated in June 2025. Eligible studies included adults with T1D, body mass index ≥25 kg/m, and GLP-1RA treatment alongside insulin for ≥12 weeks. Changes in body weight, HbA1c, and insulin dose were expressed as mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Safety outcomes were assessed using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Data were pooled using random-effects models. Exactly 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. GLP-1RA treatment was associated with a body weight reduction of 4.31 kg (95% CI: 3.61-5.00 kg) and a HbA1c reduction of 0.25% (95% CI: 0.18-0.32%). Across all studies, insulin dosage was reduced by 9.24 U/day (95% CI: 7.04-11.45 U/day). Subgroup analysis identified that semaglutide achieved the greatest reductions in all outcome measures.

      "abstract": "To date, clinical trials have been underpowered to assess which antiretrovirals perform best in people with advanced HIV disease. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of an integrase inhibitor-containing versus a boosted protease inhibitor-containing regimen for this population. In this open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority trial in seven European countries (Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Ireland, and the UK), therapy-naive adults with advanced HIV disease were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (integrase inhibitor group) or darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (boosted protease inhibitor group) for 48 weeks. Randomisation was computer generated in permuted blocks within strata with block sizes of four and stratified by country and baseline CD4 cell count. The primary composite outcome (time to first occurrence of specified virological or clinical events) and its components were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses in both modified intention-to-treat (mITT) and per-protocol populations. The mITT population included all randomly allocated participants who received at least one dose of the study drug, whereas the per-protocol population excluded those who received incorrect treatment. Non-inferiority of the integrase inhibitor-based regimen versus the boosted protease inhibitor-containing regimen was declared if the upper limit of the 95% CI of the hazard ratio (HR) for the primary composite endpoint was less than 1·606, corresponding to a 12% difference in the cumulative probability of the composite primary endpoint. Adverse events, a secondary endpoint, were recorded at eight visits in all participants. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03696160, and is completed. Between May 13, 2019, and June 26, 2023, 222 people were randomly assigned to the integrase inhibitor group and 225 to the boosted protease inhibitor group. Of these 447 recruited participants, 442 (99%) participants with a median CD4 count of 41 cells per μL (IQR 17-79) received at least one dose. 358 (81%) of the 442 treated participants self-reported as male and 84 (19%) female, and 276 (62%) were of White ethnicity, 83 (19%) Black, and 83 (19%) other. In the mITT analysis, the 48-week composite primary outcome event occurred in 49 (22%) of 220 participants in the integrase inhibitor group versus 70 (32%) of 222 participants in the boosted protease inhibitor group (adjusted HR 0·70 [95% CI 0·48-1·00]; non-inferiority shown). The per-protocol analysis gave a similar estimated adjusted HR of 0·69 (0·48-1·00; non-inferiority shown). By mITT, drug-related adverse events (grade ≥2) occurred in 16 (7%) of 220 participants in the integrase inhibitor group versus 32 (14%) of 222 in the boosted protease inhibitor group (p=0·043). The rates of serious adverse events or adverse events leading to study discontinuation did not differ between groups. 12 deaths occurred during the study (nine in the integrase inhibitor group and three in the boosted protease inhibitor group), not related to the study drugs. In people with advanced HIV disease, bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide was shown to be non-inferior to darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide and resulted in fewer adverse events, supporting its use as a preferred first-line antiretroviral regimen in this vulnerable population.

The MAPLE-HCM trial showed greater improvement in exercise capacity and secondary endpoints for aficamten monotherapy vs metoprolol monotherapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of aficamten vs metoprolol across multiple clinically relevant and patient-centric measures of disease burden in oHCM. Patients with oHCM and left ventricular outflow tract gradient (LVOT-G) ≥30 mm Hg at rest and/or ≥50 mm Hg with Valsalva were randomly assigned to aficamten (n = 88) or metoprolol (n = 87). Dose titration was based on vital signs and echocardiograms. Assessment of clinical response by treatment arm was based on improvement in multiple parameters reflecting oHCM disease burden: LVOT-G <30 mm Hg at rest and <50 mm Hg with Valsalva; ≥1 class improvement in NYHA functional class and/or ≥10-point improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CSS); ≥50% reduction in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide; ≥1.0 mL/kg/min increase in peak oxygen consumption (pVO); and ≥10% reduction in left atrial volume index. Clinical response was classified by number of efficacy outcomes achieved: nonresponder (none), limited (1 or 2), positive (3 or 4), or complete (all 5). Baseline characteristics were similar for both treatment groups. For the overall cohort, mean age was 58 ± 13.2 years; 73 (42%) were women, 103 (70%) were in NYHA functional class II and 52 (30%) in class III, mean pVO was 19.9 ± 5.1 mL/kg/min, and mean KCCQ-CSS score was 66 ± 16. At 24 weeks, aficamten treatment was associated with greater benefits in all efficacy outcome measures, with numbers needed to treat ranging from 1.5 to 5.0 relative to metoprolol treatment. Patients treated with aficamten were more likely to be either positive or complete responders compared with patients treated with metoprolol (78% vs 3%, respectively; P < 0.001). In patients with symptomatic oHCM, aficamten monotherapy led to superior and rapid treatment benefits across several clinically relevant outcome measures of disease burden compared with metoprolol. These observations support the emerging role of aficamten as monotherapy for oHCM.

We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving adolescents and adults with C3 glomerulopathy or primary immune-complex MPGN, including those with native kidney disease and those with disease recurrence after transplantation. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive pegcetacoplan or placebo. The primary end point was the log-transformed ratio of the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio at week 26 as compared with baseline. A total of 124 patients underwent randomization. The change in proteinuria (as measured by the log-transformed ratio to baseline in the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio) was significantly greater with pegcetacoplan than with placebo (geometric mean of the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio, -67.2% [95% confidence interval {CI}, -74.9 to -57.2] vs. 2.9% [95% CI, -8.6 to 15.9]). The difference represents a relative reduction of 68.1% (95% CI, 57.3 to 76.2) as compared with placebo. In hierarchical testing of five secondary end points, significantly higher percentages of patients in the pegcetacoplan group than in the placebo group met the composite renal end-point criteria (stabilization of estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] and ≥50% reduction in urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio) (49% vs. 3%) and had at least a 50% reduction in the protein-to-creatinine ratio (60% vs. 5%). Among 69 patients with evaluable kidney-biopsy samples, the change in the activity score of the C3 glomerulopathy histologic index did not differ significantly between the two groups; subsequent end points (decrease in C3 staining and change in eGFR) were not formally tested. Pegcetacoplan was not associated with more adverse events than placebo. No serious infections from encapsulated bacteria occurred; 1 patient receiving pegcetacoplan died from coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. No allograft rejection or loss occurred. Pegcetacoplan resulted in a significantly greater reduction in proteinuria than placebo among patients with C3 glomerulopathy or primary immune-complex MPGN.

In hierarchical testing of five secondary end points, significantly higher percentages of patients in the pegcetacoplan group than in the placebo group met the composite renal end-point criteria (stabilization of estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] and ≥50% reduction in urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio) (49% vs. 3%) and had at least a 50% reduction in the protein-to-creatinine ratio (60% vs. 5%). Among 69 patients with evaluable kidney-biopsy samples, the change in the activity score of the C3 glomerulopathy histologic index did not differ significantly between the two groups; subsequent end points (decrease in C3 staining and change in eGFR) were not formally tested. Pegcetacoplan was not associated with more adverse events than placebo. No serious infections from encapsulated bacteria occurred; 1 patient receiving pegcetacoplan died from coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. No allograft rejection or loss occurred."

To assess the risk of gestational diabetes associated with OCS use during pregnancy. This nationwide, population-based cohort study included pregnancies resulting in live births in Korea from 2010 through 2021. A sequential landmark analysis was conducted, with OCS exposure assessed in 3-week intervals between 1 and 27 weeks' gestation. Data were analyzed from June 26, 2024, to September 19, 2025. Pregnancies among women who were exposed to OCSs were compared with pregnancies among women who were not exposed to OCSs within each 3-week interval and in pooled analyses. Gestational diabetes was assessed from 20 weeks plus 1 day of gestation until delivery using a previously validated algorithm. Propensity score-based overlap weighting was applied to adjust for comorbidities, medication use, and health care utilization. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using bootstrapping with 200 replications. Subgroup analyses by age, indication, duration of action, dose, timing, and duration of exposures were performed. Among 3 848 270 pregnancies, 1 325 940 were eligible for analysis, of which 79 710 (6.0%) were exposed to OCSs between 1 and 27 weeks' gestation. OCS exposure was not associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes in most intervals, except between 4 and 6 weeks' gestation (weighted RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.17). In the pooled analysis, gestational diabetes occurred in 9.50% (95% CI, 9.26%-9.74%) of pregnancies among women in the exposed group vs 7.36% (95% CI, 7.31%-7.43%) of pregnancies among those in the unexposed group (weighted RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99-1.03). Subgroup analyses showed no significant effect modification by maternal age, indication, duration of action, dosage, timing, or duration of exposure. In this cohort study, OCS exposure during pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes, except for a modest increase in risk among women exposed to OCSs between 4 and 6 weeks' gestation, supporting the use of OCSs when clinically indicated.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes is a critical risk factor for cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Type 2 diabetes increases all-cause and cardiovascular death and impairs health-related quality of life. More than a third of people with type 2 diabetes develop kidney failure, requiring treatment with dialysis or kidney transplantation. People with CKD and type 2 diabetes have a substantially higher risk of premature cardiovascular complications. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are glucose-lowering agents that achieve glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes and may prevent poor kidney and cardiovascular outcomes for people with CKD and type 2 diabetes. However, new trials are emerging rapidly, and continuous evidence synthesis is essential to summarising cumulative evidence. This review aims to assess the benefits and harms of DPP-4 inhibitors in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes. We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 25 March 2025 using a search strategy designed by an Information Specialist. Studies in the Register are continually identified through regular searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomised controlled studies (RCTs) were eligible if they compared treatment with a DPP-4 inhibitor against placebo, standard medical care (including usual other glucose-lowering agents or no treatment), or another glucose-lowering agent in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes. We included all CKD categories (from 1 to 5), including people treated with dialysis. People with type 1 diabetes and kidney transplant recipients were excluded. The critical review outcomes were cardiovascular death and hypoglycaemia requiring third-party assistance. The key important outcomes included 3- and 4-point major cardiovascular events (MACE), nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and kidney failure. The risk of bias version 2 tool was used to assess the studies. Three review authors independently extracted data and assessed the study risk of bias. Treatment estimates were summarised using random effects meta-analysis and expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD), with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Evidence certainty was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Fifty-nine studies involving 27,893 participants were included. DPP-4 inhibitors with or without other background treatments were compared to placebo, standard medical care, sodium-glucose cotransport 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, sulfonylurea, other DPP-4 inhibitors, insulin, or alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. There were no studies evaluating treatment in children. We contacted 10 authors from primary studies to retrieve additional information, but no further data were added to this review. Compared to placebo or standard medical care, DPP-4 inhibitors may have little or no effect on the risk of cardiovascular death (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.14; 6 studies, 7568 participants; low-certainty evidence) and hypoglycaemia requiring third-party assistance in people with all CKD categories (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.25; I² = 0%; 10 studies, 8994 participants; low-certainty evidence). DPP-4 inhibitors probably have little or no effect on 3-point MACE compared with placebo (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.17; 1 study, 6979 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). DPP-4 inhibitors had uncertain effects on the risk of 4-point MACE compared with placebo (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.88; 1 study, 133 participants; very low-certainty evidence), nonfatal myocardial infarction compared with placebo in people with CKD categories 3-5, including those on dialysis (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.36 to 10.08; 1 study, 133 participants; very-low-certainty evidence), or nonfatal stroke compared with placebo (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.97; 1 study, 133 participants; very-low-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo or standard medical care, DPP-4 inhibitors probably have little or no effect on kidney failure in people with all CKD categories (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.53; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 7472 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The effects of DPP-4 inhibitors compared to other glucose-lowering agents were uncertain. No studies evaluated treatment on the clinical outcomes of life participation, lactic acidosis, blindness, diabetic ketoacidosis, peritoneal dialysis infection, or peritoneal dialysis failure. The overall risk of bias was assessed as low or very low for most included studies. DPP-4 inhibitors had an uncertain effect on the risks of cardiovascular death and hypoglycaemia requiring third-party assistance in people with CKD and type 2 diabetes when compared with placebo or standard medical care, whilst the effects on other glucose-lowering agents were uncertain. Despite the large number of studies, there is little evidence that DPP-4 inhibitors prevent key adverse clinical outcomes for people who have CKD and type 2 diabetes. Future well-designed and adequately powered RCTs can provide better information about the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors on key patient-reported outcomes and cost to better inform decision-making and clinical practice in this setting.

      "abstract": "With increasing global incidence of acute dengue virus (DENV) infection, more accurate estimates of the burden of neurological events following infection are required; however, population-based estimates are lacking. To evaluate the risk and excess burden of neurological events in a cohort of DENV-infected adults in the acute postinfectious period vs population-based comparators without DENV infection. This was a retrospective, population-based cohort study in Singapore. National registries were used to construct a cohort of all adults (aged ≥18 years) infected with DENV from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2023, for whom the index date (time 0 [T0]) was taken as the date of notification, and a cohort of uninfected population-based comparators, for whom T0 was randomly assigned to match T0 distribution in DENV-infected cases. As the period overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 within 30 days of T0 were additionally excluded, as were individuals who died before T0 and uninfected comparators with no prior health care contact. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 2017, through March 30, 2024. DENV infection recorded in the national registry. New-incident neurological events, including any neurological event, memory loss, movement disorders, and other neurological disorders (eg, fatigue or malaise, encephalitis or encephalopathy), following DENV infection were identified using national health care claims records, and risk was assessed over the acute follow-up period. Odds of new-incident neurological events in DENV-infected cases vs uninfected comparators were estimated using overlap-weighted logistic regression at 30 to 90 days after T0. A total of 65 207 confirmed DENV-infected cases (mean [SD] age, 48.4 [17.8] years; 34 876 [53.5%] male) were compared against 1 616 865 uninfected comparators (mean [SD] age, 54.8 [18.3] years; 730 702 [45.2%] male). At 30 days following DENV infection, individuals with DENV infection, compared with uninfected individuals, had elevated odds of any new-incident neurological event (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 9.69; 95% CI, 6.59-14.90), memory loss (aOR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.36-8.69), movement disorders (aOR, 7.10; 95% CI, 2.49-29.18), and other neurological events (aOR, 14.32; 95% CI, 8.61-26.04); risk trajectories diverged up to 90 days after infection. However, the overall excess burden was modest, with less than 1 excess event per 100 cases. The DENV-infected cases, compared with uninfected individuals, had increased odds of memory loss (aOR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.30-7.87) and movement disorders (aOR, 6.38; 95% CI, 2.23-25.96) only among those aged 60 years or older and in cases infected during DENV serotype 3 transmission. DENV infection was associated with significantly higher odds of acute new-incident neurological events following infection, although the excess burden was modest. Older adults should be monitored for a wider spectrum of potential neurological complications following DENV infection.",

At 30 days following DENV infection, individuals with DENV infection, compared with uninfected individuals, had elevated odds of any new-incident neurological event (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 9.69; 95% CI, 6.59-14.90), memory loss (aOR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.36-8.69), movement disorders (aOR, 7.10; 95% CI, 2.49-29.18), and other neurological events (aOR, 14.32; 95% CI, 8.61-26.04); risk trajectories diverged up to 90 days after infection. However, the overall excess burden was modest, with less than 1 excess event per 100 cases. The DENV-infected cases, compared with uninfected individuals, had increased odds of memory loss (aOR, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.30-7.87) and movement disorders (aOR, 6.38; 95% CI, 2.23-25.96) only among those aged 60 years or older and in cases infected during DENV serotype 3 transmission."

      "abstract": "Blepharitis is a common ocular condition characterized by inflammation of the eyelid margins, which can cause irritating symptoms and ocular surface damage. Conventional treatment of blepharitis consists of eyelid hygiene and artificial tears. To suppress inflammation, topical corticosteroids, with or without antibiotics, are frequently prescribed. However, long-term use is limited by side effects such as increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma and/or cataract formation. Newer steroid-sparing topical immunosuppressants have emerged as alternative treatments. To assess the benefits and harms of topical immunosuppressants for blepharitis in adults. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and three trial registries from inception to 6 April 2025. We searched the reference lists of included studies for any additional studies not identified by the electronic searches. There were no date or language restrictions on the selection of eligible studies. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical immunosuppressants (corticosteroids, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus) of different doses or carrier, with placebo, no treatment, conventional treatment (lid hygiene, artificial tears) or other topical immunosuppressants in adults with blepharitis. We excluded paired-eye studies and highly specific blepharitis subtypes. Our outcomes were: (1) change from baseline in composite (or total) symptom score; (2) change from baseline in tear film breakup time; (3) change from baseline in corneal staining scores; (4) proportion of individuals experiencing symptomatic improvement; (5) reduction in number of or eradication of colonies of positive cultures of bacteria; (6) quality of life measures; (7) economic costs of different topical immunosuppressants; and (8) adverse effects. We used Cochrane's risk of bias (RoB) 2 tool for all outcomes reported in the summary of findings tables. Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We used fixed-effect meta-analysis to combine data and forest plots to assess heterogeneity, effect size, and direction. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. When meta-analysis was not possible, we used narrative synthesis. We included 12 RCTs with 2752 participants (2802 eyes) in total. Six of the trials were conducted in the USA. Topical corticosteroid was the most frequently studied immunosuppressant, followed by cyclosporine and tacrolimus. The point of assessment and duration of treatment ranged from two to 12 weeks. No study measured the proportion of individuals experiencing symptomatic improvement. We report outcomes of interest for three key comparisons below at four to 12 weeks. No study assessed reduction or eradication of colonies of positive cultures of bacteria, quality of life or economic costs. Topical corticosteroids (with or without antibiotics) versus placebo The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of topical corticosteroids on composite symptom scores (corticosteroids with antibiotics: standard mean difference [SMD] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31 to 1.44; 2 studies, 57 participants; corticosteroids alone: SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.20; 2 studies, 232 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported tear breakup time. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of topical corticosteroids on corneal staining scores (corticosteroids with antibiotics: MD 0.70, 95% CI -1.05 to 2.45; 1 study, 27 participants; corticosteroids alone: MD 0.50, 95% CI -1.22 to 2.22; 1 study, 27 participants); both, very low-certainty evidence. The adverse event of irritation of the ocular surface was reported narratively and was similar between the two groups. The adverse event of ocular hypertension was reported narratively and not detected in either group in one study where it was reported. Topical corticosteroids (with or without antibiotics) versus antibiotics The evidence for topical corticosteroids was inconclusive. One study found that topical corticosteroid with antibiotic treatment may reduce symptom scores more than antibiotics alone (MD -11.34, 95% CI -13.13 to -9.55; 1 study, 148 participants), whereas the other found that it may have little to no effect (MD 0.40, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.91; 1 study, 201 participants); both, low-certainty evidence. Topical corticosteroids plus antibiotics probably result in greater reduction in corneal staining scores compared with antibiotics alone (MD -1.26, 95% CI -1.56 to -0.96; 1 study, 148 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). However, this effect was not observed for tear breakup time when antibiotics alone are likely to perform better (MD -1.10, 95% CI -1.39 to -0.81; 1 study, 148 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The adverse event of irritation of the ocular surface was reported narratively, and was similar between the two groups. The adverse event of ocular hypertension was reported narratively, and was higher in the corticosteroid (with or without antibiotics) group. Topical cyclosporine versus placebo Topical cyclosporine may have little to no effect on the composite symptom score compared with placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (SMD 0.15, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.57; 2 studies, 90 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of topical cyclosporine on tear breakup time compared with placebo (invasive time: MD 4.70, 95% CI -0.24 to 9.64; 1 study, 26 participants, although for non-invasive time, it may provide a potential benefit: MD 1.59, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.70; 1 study, 64 participants; both very low-certainty evidence). Topical cyclosporine may improve corneal staining compared with placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 2.60, 95% CI 0.68 to 4.52; 1 study, 26 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No study reported adverse events. Topical corticosteroids, with or without antibiotics, including cyclosporine may make little to no difference in reducing signs and symptoms of blepharitis at four to 12 weeks, compared with placebo or antibiotics alone. Topical corticosteroids are generally well tolerated and associated with minimal risk of ocular surface irritation. Topical corticosteroids plus antibiotics probably improve corneal staining compared to antibiotics alone. When managing patients with blepharitis, clinicians should consider the limited quantity and very low certainty of evidence for topical corticosteroids. Conventional lid hygiene and warm compress remain valid therapeutic options.

Ianalumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting B cells, is being assessed as a short-course second-line therapy in ITP. In this phase 3, randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, adults with primary ITP and an insufficient response or a relapse after first-line glucocorticoid therapy to receive ianalumab at a dose of 9 mg or 3 mg per kilogram of body weight or placebo once monthly for 4 months. Eltrombopag, an oral thrombopoietin-receptor agonist, was administered once daily in each group according to local prescribing information; the dose was tapered until discontinuation by the end of week 24 in eligible patients. The primary end point was freedom from treatment failure, as determined in a time-to-event analysis, with treatment failure defined by a platelet count of less than 30×10 per liter more than 8 weeks after randomization, initiation of rescue therapy more than 8 weeks after randomization, initiation of new ITP therapy, inability to taper or discontinue eltrombopag because of an inadequate platelet count, or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. The key secondary end point was a stable response at 6 months, defined by a platelet count of at least 50×10 per liter in at least 75% of the measurements between weeks 19 and 25 without use of rescue therapy or new ITP therapy. Safety was assessed. A total of 152 patients underwent randomization: 50 to the 9-mg ianalumab group, 51 to the 3-mg ianalumab group, and 51 to the placebo group. The estimated probability of being free from treatment failure at 12 months was 54% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39 to 67) in the 9-mg group, 51% (95% CI, 36 to 64) in the 3-mg group, and 30% (95% CI, 18 to 43) in the placebo group. The time to treatment failure was significantly longer with ianalumab plus eltrombopag than with placebo plus eltrombopag; the estimated hazard ratio for treatment failure (ianalumab vs. placebo) was 0.55 (P = 0.04) in the 9-mg group and 0.58 (P = 0.045) in the 3-mg group. The percentage of patients with a stable response at 6 months was significantly higher in the 9-mg group than in the placebo group (62% vs. 39%; P = 0.045).

The utility of tenecteplase compared with conventional regimens remains unstudied, to the authors' knowledge, in this patient population. To assess the relative safety and efficacy of tenecteplase compared with standard infusions of alteplase in patients with PVT. This was an open-label, parallel-group, non-inferiority randomized clinical trial among consecutive adult patients presenting with obstructive PVT of a mechanical prosthetic valve over the study period from October 2022 to August 2024 to a single tertiary care center in India. Patients received thrombolytic therapy with a low-dose slow infusion alteplase or weight-based bolus doses of tenecteplase. The primary outcomes were to determine the rates of complete thrombolytic success and the incidence of major complications. A total of 83 patients (mean [SD] age, 39.6 [12.4] years, 42 male [50.6%]) were randomized to receive alteplase (n = 43) or tenecteplase (n = 40). The rates of the primary efficacy end point (complete thrombolytic success) were significantly higher (risk ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03-1.39; P = .02 for noninferiority) in the tenecteplase group (39 patients [97.5%]) compared with the alteplase group (35 patients [81.5%]). Additionally, patients treated with tenecteplase had higher rates of complete success with the first administered dose and a shorter duration of hospital stay (median [IQR], 4.1 [3.2-5.1] days vs 6.5 [4.3-9.2] days; P < .001). The rates of major and minor adverse events were similar. Tenecteplase may be a safe and effective alternative to alteplase in patients presenting with obstructive PVT. Patients treated with tenecteplase in our study had higher rates of complete thrombolytic success and a shorter duration of hospital stay. Furthermore, the relative ease of drug administration with tenecteplase may translate to greater clinical benefit in a real-world setting. Clinical Trials Registry of India: CTRI/2022/10/046127.",

      "abstract": "Hirsutism (excessive and unwanted hair growth) is a distressing and relatively common endocrine problem in women that may prove difficult to manage. Cyproterone acetate (CPA), an antiandrogen, is frequently used to treat hirsutism, usually in combination with ethinylestradiol. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003. To assess the benefits and harms of cyproterone acetate (CPA) alone, or in combination with ethinylestradiol, and other medication in reducing hair growth and improving the endocrine profile in women with hirsutism secondary to ovarian hyperandrogenism as well as idiopathic hirsutism. We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL to 20 December 2022. We also searched the reference lists of relevant papers and clinical trial registries. We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) examining women of reproductive age with either idiopathic hirsutism or hirsutism secondary to ovarian hyperandrogenism. Hirsutism was defined as a Ferriman Gallwey (FG) score greater than 7. We included 23 studies. Only one study had more than 100 women included in the analysis. The primary outcomes were the objective and subjective assessment of clinical parameters (FG scores, linear hair growth and hair shaft diameter, women's feedback and frequency of hair removal). Secondary outcomes included endocrine parameters, side effects and withdrawals during therapy. Cyproterone acetate greater than 2 mg plus ethinylestradiol compared to cyproterone acetate 2 mg or less plus ethinylestradiol (dose comparison) After six months of treatment, we are uncertain of any difference in effect on FG scores (mean difference (MD) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.02 to 2.28; I = 0%; 2 RCTs, 145 women; very low-certainty evidence). There was likely little to no difference in free testosterone (MD 0.35 pmol/L, 95% CI -0.61 to 1.31; 1 RCT, 113 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Cyproterone acetate alone (no ethinylestradiol) compared to other interventions alone (no ethinylestradiol) There was little or no difference for CPA compared with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues on total testosterone at three months (MD 0.17 nmol/L, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.49). There was little or no evidence of an effect for CPA compared with GnRH agonist on androstenedione at three months (MD 0.66 nmol/L, 95% CI -0.44 to 1.76). Both results from one RCT (20 women; very low-certainty evidence). Cyproterone acetate plus ethinylestradiol compared to other interventions alone (no ethinylestradiol) There was little to no difference in effect for CPA plus ethinylestradiol on FG scores at six months compared with finasteride (MD 4.70, 95% CI -1.86 to 11.26; 1 RCT, 27 women; low-certainty evidence), spironolactone (MD 0.90, 95% CI -2.86 to 4.66; 1 RCT, 77 women; moderate-certainty evidence), ketoconazole (MD 0.70, 95% CI -0.84 to 2.24; 1 RCT, 81 women; moderate-certainty evidence), or pioglitazone plus flutamide plus metformin (Pio-Flu-Met) (MD 0.90, 95% CI -0.79 to 2.59; 1 RCT, 34 women; low-certainty evidence). CPA plus ethinylestradiol may improve hirsutism slightly compared with flutamide (MD 4.00, 95% CI 0.10 to 7.90; 1 RCT, 28 women). CPA plus ethinylestradiol likely results in little to no difference in total testosterone at six months compared with spironolactone (MD -0.06 nmol/L, 95% CI -1.25 to 1.13; 1 RCT, 77 women; moderate-certainty evidence), ketoconazole (MD -0.02 nmol/L, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.33; 1 RCT, 81 women; moderate-certainty evidence), or Pio-Flu-Met (MD -0.39 nmol/L, 95% CI -0.82 to 0.04; 1 RCT, 81 women; low-certainty evidence). CPA plus ethinylestradiol may be more effective than finasteride at six months (MD -1.60 nmol/L, 95% CI -2.39 to -0.81; 1 RCT, 27 women; low-certainty evidence). CPA plus ethinylestradiol may lower free testosterone slightly at six months compared to finasteride (MD -9.02 nmol/L, 95% CI -12.44 to -5.60; 1 RCT, 27 women; low-certainty evidence) or flutamide (MD -4.16 nmol/L, 95% CI -6.62 to -1.70; 1 RCT, 28 women; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference between CPA plus ethinylestradiol and spironolactone (MD 0.35 nmol/L, 95% CI -0.62 to 1.32; 1 RCT, 77 women; low-certainty evidence). CPA plus ethinylestradiol may be less effective than ketoconazole (MD 1.39 nmol/L, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.35; 1 RCT, 81 women; low-certainty evidence). Cyproterone acetate plus ethinylestradiol compared to other interventions plus ethinylestradiol CPA plus ethinylestradiol likely results in little to no difference in effect on FG scores at six months compared with finasteride plus ethinylestradiol (MD -0.91, 95% CI -1.82 to 0; 1 RCT, 26 women; moderate-certainty evidence) or spironolactone plus drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol (MD 0.69, 95% CI -0.80 to 2.18; 1 RCT, 89 women; high-certainty evidence). However, CPA plus ethinylestradiol may lower FG scores compared to spironolactone plus ethinylestradiol, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -0.93, 95% CI -1.68 to -0.19; 3 RCTs, 103 women; very low-certainty evidence). There was probably little to no difference in effect for CPA plus ethinylestradiol on total testosterone at six months compared with spironolactone plus ethinylestradiol (MD -0.20 nmol/L, 95% CI -0.64 to 0.24; 1 RCT, 45 women; moderate-certainty evidence), and likely results in little to no difference compared with drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol (MD 0.15 nmol/L, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.22; 1 RCT, 91 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Six months of CPA plus ethinylestradiol treatment likely lowered free testosterone levels compared to drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol (MD -0.31 pmol/L, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.09; 1 RCT, 91 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Data were lacking for all other outcomes in our main review comparisons. There were some differences in clinical outcome between CPA and spironolactone, CPA and flutamide, and CPA and finasteride. There were no clinical differences between CPA and the other medical therapies, possibly because of small study size, lack of standardised assessment and objective determinants of improvement in many studies. There are insufficient data presented to compare the adverse effects of all the treatment options. Larger, carefully designed studies are needed to compare efficacy and safety profiles between the therapeutic options available.",

      "abstract": "To compare the efficacy of 162 mg vs 81 mg aspirin daily for the prevention of preterm preeclampsia (less than 37 weeks of gestation) or preeclampsia with severe features among pregnant people at high risk. We conducted a pragmatic, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint clinical trial. Pregnant people at high risk for preeclampsia were randomized to treatment with either 162 mg or 81 mg aspirin daily beginning before 16 weeks of gestation until term and followed up until 6 weeks postpartum. The primary composite outcome of either preterm preeclampsia or preeclampsia with severe features was adjudicated by independent researchers blinded to treatment group. Secondary outcomes were the components of the composite, adherence to therapy, and maternal and neonatal complications. The anticipated incidence of the primary composite outcome in the 81-mg group was 8.6%. We calculated that enrollment of 394 participants (197 for each group) would have 80% power to detect a 7.1% reduction in the primary outcome with 162 mg aspirin compared with 81 mg, assuming a two-sided α of 0.05. Of 400 participants randomized, 365 had delivery data available and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, with 184 participants in the 162-mg group and 181 in the 81-mg group. The incidence of preterm preeclampsia or preeclampsia with severe features was 26 of 184 (14.1%) in the 162-mg group compared with 31 of 181 (17.1%) in the 81-mg group (relative risk 0.83, 95% CI, 0.51-1.33, P=.4). Individual outcomes of preterm preeclampsia and term preeclampsia with severe features were similar between aspirin groups. Adherence rates ranged from 88% to 91% and 89% to 92% for the 162-mg group compared with the 81-mg group, respectively, across study visits.

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and effects of dry needling in women with provoked vestibulodynia. Forty-six women diagnosed with provoked vestibulodynia were randomized to receive six weekly sessions of either real or sham dry needling (DN). Participants, investigators and data analysts were blinded. Feasibility outcomes (adherence to treatment, questionnaire completion and dropout rate) and side effects were measured throughout the study. Pain intensity during intercourse (0-10 numeric rating scale) was measured at baseline and posttreatment, and acceptability (questionnaire) was assessed at posttreatment. Women in the realDN group attended 99% of the planned treatment sessions, compared to 91% in the shamDN group. Additionally, 100% of the questionnaires were completed in the realDN group, compared to 93% in the shamDN group. All participants in the realDN group completed the study. In contrast, two participants in the shamDN group withdrew. For the main side effects, 96% of the participants in the realDN group and 52% in the shamDN group experienced muscle aches (p<.001). Moreover, 35% experienced autonomic reactions in the realDN group, while these were not observed in the shamDN group (p<.001). All participants reported high levels of acceptability across all dimensions, with no significant difference between groups. The realDN group showed a significant decrease in pain intensity compared to the shamDN group (mean difference between groups 2.4; 95%CI 1.4-3.3; p<.001). Our findings support the feasibility and acceptability of dry needling to treat women with provoked vestibulodynia and showed a significant effect in reducing pain. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents the results of a novel study examining the feasibility and acceptability of using dry needling to treat women suffering from provoked vestibulodynia and lays the groundwork to inform a future randomized controlled trial.",

While most home hospital programs have been implemented in urban areas, its feasibility in rural areas, where access to care is a major challenge, is unknown. To compare home hospital care with BAM hospital care for patients residing in rural areas. This randomized clinical trial took place from 2022 to 2023 with a 30-day follow-up in 3 rural areas in the US and Canada. Participants were adults recruited in the emergency department who required hospital-level care for select acute conditions (infections, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and other diagnoses). Patients in the home hospital group received acute care at home, including in-home nurse and/or paramedic visits, remote physician care, intravenous medications, remote monitoring, video communication, and point-of-care testing. Patients in the BAM group received services at a rural BAM hospital. The primary outcome was the relative change in the acute care episode's direct cost. Secondary outcomes were 30-day readmission, days at home within 30 days of discharge, and physical activity. Exploratory outcomes included the Picker Experience Score and Net Promoter Score. A total of 161 patients (79 home; 82 BAM) with mean (SD) age of 64.4 (17.2) years (home) and 64.9 (14.1) years (control) were included. Most were female (home, 52 [65.8%]; BAM, 50 [61.0%]). The adjusted mean cost of the acute episode was not significantly different (home vs BAM, 14% greater; 95% CI, -6% to 39%; P = .19). There were no significant differences in 30-day readmission (home vs BAM: 8 [10.1%] vs 14 [17.1%]) or mean (SD) days at home within 30 days of discharge (home vs BAM: 28.6 [3.4] vs 28.4 [3.4] days). Patients in the home hospital group were less sedentary, according to accelerometer measurements, than those in the BAM group (mean [SD], 78.0% [10.4%] vs 86.0% [7.2%] of the day sedentary; mean difference, -8.0%; 95% CI, -12.8% to -3.3%; P < .001) and had more mean (SD) steps daily (834.1 [1219.6] vs 120.4 [206.0] steps; mean difference, 713.7 steps; 95% CI, 290.2 to 1137.2 steps; P < .001). Total mean (SD) length of stay (ie, BAM and home hospital days for intervention patients and BAM days for control patients) was not significantly different (home vs BAM: 6.7 [5.0] days vs 5.4 [4.4] days), although patients receiving care at home transferred late in their course (mean [SD] day of transfer, 4.2 [4.3] of 6.7 days). Patients in the home hospital group reported better experiences than those in the BAM hospital group: the mean (SD) Picker experience score was 13.4 (2.6) vs 11.0 (3.8) (mean difference, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.8; P < .001), and the mean (SD) net-promoter score was 88.4 (32.3) vs 45.5 (69.9) (mean difference, 43.0; 95% CI, 17.5 to 68.5; P < .001). Safety events occurred in 11 (14.1%) home patients vs 10 (12.4%) BAM patients (mean difference, 1.8%; 95% CI, -8.1% to 11.6%; P = .74). In this randomized clinical trial of home hospital care in rural settings, cost and readmission were unchanged while patient activity and experience improved. Late transfer home likely attenuated the intervention's effect. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05256303.",

Patients in the home hospital group were less sedentary, according to accelerometer measurements, than those in the BAM group (mean [SD], 78.0% [10.4%] vs 86.0% [7.2%] of the day sedentary; mean difference, -8.0%; 95% CI, -12.8% to -3.3%; P < .001) and had more mean (SD) steps daily (834.1 [1219.6] vs 120.4 [206.0] steps; mean difference, 713.7 steps; 95% CI, 290.2 to 1137.2 steps; P < .001). Total mean (SD) length of stay (ie, BAM and home hospital days for intervention patients and BAM days for control patients) was not significantly different (home vs BAM: 6.7 [5.0] days vs 5.4 [4.4] days), although patients receiving care at home transferred late in their course (mean [SD] day of transfer, 4.2 [4.3] of 6.7 days). Patients in the home hospital group reported better experiences than those in the BAM hospital group: the mean (SD) Picker experience score was 13.4 (2.6) vs 11.0 (3.8) (mean difference, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.8; P < .001), and the mean (SD) net-promoter score was 88.4 (32.3) vs 45.5 (69.9) (mean difference, 43.0; 95% CI, 17.5 to 68.5; P < .001). Safety events occurred in 11 (14.1%) home patients vs 10 (12.4%) BAM patients (mean difference, 1.8%; 95% CI, -8.1% to 11.6%; P = .74)."

      "abstract": "There is limited guidance on how to stop using nicotine-containing vapes (otherwise known as e-cigarettes) and ensure long-term abstinence, whilst minimising the risk of tobacco smoking and other unintended consequences. Treatments could include pharmacological interventions, behavioural interventions, or both. To conduct a living systematic review assessing the benefits and harms of interventions to help people stop vaping compared to each other, placebo or no intervention. To assess how these interventions affect the use of combustible tobacco, and whether effects vary based on participant characteristics. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from 1 January 2004 to 1 July 2025. We also searched the references of eligible studies and abstracts from the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco conferences, and contacted study authors. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) recruiting people of any age using nicotine-containing vapes, regardless of tobacco smoking status. Studies had to test an intervention designed to support people to quit vaping, and plan to measure at least one of our outcomes. Critical outcomes: vaping cessation at six months or longer; change in combustible tobacco use at six months or longer; number of participants reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) at one week or longer. We used Cochrane's RoB 1 tool to assess risk of bias in the included studies. We followed standard Cochrane methods. We grouped studies by comparisons and outcomes, and calculated individual study and pooled effects, as appropriate. We used random-effects Mantel-Haenszel methods to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and random-effects inverse variance methods to calculate mean differences (MDs) and 95% CIs. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for our critical outcomes. Fifteen studies (six new to this updated version) involving 5800 participants are included. Fourteen studies included some participants who had previously smoked tobacco; in seven studies, participants were not smoking at baseline. Twelve studies only included participants aged 18 or older (five exclusively included people between 18 and 29); two included some participants under 18 years; and one included 13- to 17-year-olds only. Fourteen studies were conducted in the USA and one in Italy. We judged five studies at low, six at high, and four at unclear risk of bias. Pharmacological interventions Studies assessed our critical outcomes in relation to combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), cytisine, and varenicline compared to placebo or no/minimal support. For combination NRT versus no/minimal support, there was no clear evidence of benefit for vaping cessation rates at six months or longer, with the CI incorporating the possibility of reduced and increased cessation rates (very low-certainty evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.25; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 214 participants). One study investigating cytisine versus placebo did not report vaping cessation at six months or longer. When compared to placebo, varenicline increased vaping cessation rates at six months, but evidence was of low certainty due to imprecision (RR 2.71, 95% CI 1.33 to 5.49; I = 48%; 2 studies, 315 participants). One study comparing combination NRT versus no/minimal support reported combustible tobacco cessation. There was no clear evidence of higher tobacco cessation in either arm, and CIs were imprecise. The evidence was of very low certainty due to imprecision and risk of bias (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.37; 198 participants). Zero participants reported SAEs in the two studies investigating combination NRT versus no/minimal support (706 participants; very low-certainty evidence due to risk of bias and imprecision) and in the one study investigating cytisine versus placebo (159 participants; low-certainty evidence due to imprecision). Four studies evaluating varenicline versus placebo measured SAEs, with zero events reported in two studies. Thus, our effect estimate was based on two studies (RR 2.82, 95% CI 0.45 to 17.59; 304 participants; low-certainty evidence due to imprecision). Behavioural interventions Studies assessed our critical outcomes in relation to reducing nicotine/vaping behaviour and text message-based interventions compared to no/minimal support. There was no clear evidence that nicotine/vaping reduction increased vaping cessation at six months compared to minimal support (RR 3.38, 95% CI 0.43 to 26.30; 1 study, 17 participants; very low-certainty evidence due to imprecision and risk of bias). There was low-certainty evidence (due to indirectness) that text message-based interventions may increase vaping cessation rates compared to no/minimal support in 13- to 24-year-olds specifically (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.47; I = 0%; 2 studies, 4091 participants). There was very low-certainty evidence (due to indirectness and imprecision) that text message-based interventions for vaping cessation may result in little to no difference in smoking uptake (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.33; 1 study, 1036 participants) or cessation (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.19; 1 study, 793 participants) compared to no/minimal support. The one study investigating nicotine/vaping behaviour reduction versus minimal support did not report SAEs. Three studies investigating text message-based interventions reported SAEs; however, zero events were reported (2082 participants; low-certainty evidence due to imprecision). Low-certainty evidence suggests that text message-based interventions to help people stop nicotine vaping may help more youths and young adults to successfully stop compared to no/minimal support, with very uncertain evidence regarding their effect on smoking behaviours. Low-certainty evidence suggests that varenicline may help people quit vaping. Data exploring the effectiveness of combination NRT, cytisine, and nicotine/vaping behaviour reduction are inconclusive due to risk of bias and imprecision. Most studies that measured SAEs reported that none had occurred; however, more data are needed to draw clear conclusions. Studies that have investigated these interventions for quitting smoking have not demonstrated serious concerns about SAEs. It is important that future studies measure combustible tobacco outcomes so the complete risk profile of relevant interventions can be considered. Further RCTs are underway. To ensure this review continues to provide up-to-date information to decision-makers, we will maintain it as a living systematic review by running searches monthly and updating the review when relevant new evidence that will strengthen or change our conclusions emerges.

Through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Pan-Canadian Network for HIV/AIDS and STBBI (sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections) Clinical Trials Research, we have updated the 2017 guideline on clinical indications and drug regimens for PrEP and PEP in Canada. Drawing on meetings with community-based organizations representing key populations affected by HIV in Canada, along with evidence from 3 systematic reviews on PrEP, PEP, and HIV risk assessment tools (searches to June 2024), our diverse panel of 19 experts formulated recommendations on PrEP and PEP. We used a formal evidence-to-decision-making framework and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. We followed the Guidelines International Network principles for managing competing interests. Our guideline development and reporting adhere with Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II. This guideline contains 31 recommendations and 10 good practice statements. Although it is appropriate to prescribe PrEP to adults and adolescents who request it, clinicians are also encouraged to assess HIV risk during routine health visits to identify people who would benefit from PrEP. Clinicians should elicit information about patients' anatomy and sexual partners in a culturally sensitive and affirming manner to determine which PrEP regimens - daily oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), on-demand TDF/FTC, daily oral tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine, or long-acting injectable cabotegravir - are suitable options. When assessing whether PEP is needed, clinicians should consider the likelihood that the source person has transmissible HIV, as well as the biological risk of HIV transmission based on exposure type. Preferred PEP regimens are dolutegravir plus TDF/FTC, or bictegravir/tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine. Multiple safe, effective PrEP and PEP regimens are now available in Canada, making it increasingly possible to find suitable options for all who could benefit. Implementation of this guideline should expand access to biomedical HIV prevention interventions for those at risk and decrease the incidence of HIV in Canada.",

      "abstract": "Levosimendan may facilitate weaning from venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) and improve survival, but supporting evidence remains limited. To assess whether early administration of levosimendan reduces the time to successful VA-ECMO weaning in patients with severe but potentially reversible cardiogenic shock. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted across 11 intensive care units (ICUs) in France. Between August 27, 2021, and September 10, 2024, 205 adult patients with acute cardiogenic shock who had started VA-ECMO in the preceding 48 hours were enrolled. Final follow-up was completed on November 10, 2024. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive levosimendan, 0.15 μg/kg per minute, to be increased to 0.20 μg/kg per minute after 2 hours (n = 101), or placebo (n = 104). The primary outcome was time to successful ECMO weaning within 30 days following randomization. Secondary outcomes included ECMO-, mechanical ventilation-, and organ failure-free days, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, serious adverse events, and all-cause 30- and 60-day mortality. Among the 205 randomized patients (median age, 58 [IQR, 50-67] years; 149 [72.7%] male), main cardiogenic shock etiologies were postcardiotomy (79 [38.5%]), acute myocardial infarction (56 [27.3%]), and myocarditis (28 [13.7%]). Treatment dose was increased to 0.20 ± 0.01 μg/kg per minute in 93% of patients receiving levosimendan and in 96% of those receiving placebo. Within 30 days, 69 of 101 patients (68.3%) had a successful ECMO weaning in the levosimendan group compared with 71 of 104 (68.3%) in the placebo group (risk difference, 0.0% [95% CI, -12.8% to 12.7%]; subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.74-1.39]; P = .92).

          "text": "Among the 205 randomized patients (median age, 58 [IQR, 50-67] years; 149 [72.7%] male), main cardiogenic shock etiologies were postcardiotomy (79 [38.5%]), acute myocardial infarction (56 [27.3%]), and myocarditis (28 [13.7%]). Treatment dose was increased to 0.20 ± 0.01 μg/kg per minute in 93% of patients receiving levosimendan and in 96% of those receiving placebo. Within 30 days, 69 of 101 patients (68.3%) had a successful ECMO weaning in the levosimendan group compared with 71 of 104 (68.3%) in the placebo group (risk difference, 0.0% [95% CI, -12.8% to 12.7%]; subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.74-1.39]; P = .92). In the levosimendan and placebo groups, respectively, median ECMO duration (5 [IQR, 4-7] days vs 6 [IQR, 4-11] days; P = .53), mean ICU length of stay (18 [SD, 15] days vs 19 [SD, 15] days; P = .42), and 60-day mortality (27.7% vs 25.0%; risk difference, 2.7% [95% CI, -9.0% to 15.3%]; P = .78) did not differ significantly.
