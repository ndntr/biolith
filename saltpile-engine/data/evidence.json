      "abstract": "Five years from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, morbidity and mortality have subsided. Vaccines have contributed to reducing the risk of infection and severe disease. However, new COVID-19 variants continue to emerge, and the role of oral antivirals such as molnupiravir in preventing progression of disease or hospitalisation must be assessed. To assess the effects of molnupiravir in people with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and mild to moderate symptoms. We identified all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) by searching the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, Science Citation Index Expanded, the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease database, and the COVID Network Meta-Analysis database with no language restrictions up to 26 April 2024. We considered full-text articles, preprints, abstracts, trial registry records, and reports of ongoing trials. Cluster-RCTs were eligible for inclusion, but cross-over trials were ineligible. Participants had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without risk factors for severe disease. The intervention was molnupiravir 800 mg taken orally every 12 hours for five days, and control was no treatment, placebo, or standard of care, as defined by the study authors. We excluded studies comparing molnupiravir with treatment strategies that included molnupiravir. Our critical outcomes were all-cause mortality and hospitalisation. Our important outcomes were change in clinical status, viral clearance, quality of life, adverse events, and serious adverse events. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias in each included study using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2). Disagreements were resolved through discussion. We conducted a meta-analysis where two or more studies with reasonably similar clinical and methodological characteristics reported the same outcome. We used data from intention-to-treat analysis where available. We analysed all outcomes at the participant level using the generic inverse variance method, applying a random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. This review included 11 studies (31,272 participants). Eight studies recruited outpatients and three recruited inpatients. We did not meta-analyse inpatient studies, as characteristics varied widely. All outpatient studies included participants with mild to moderate COVID-19, with a mean age ranging from 35 years to 57 years and variable prevalences of comorbidities and COVID-19 vaccination. We excluded suboptimal molnupiravir dosing arms in four outpatient studies and one inpatient study. Outpatients Molnupiravir compared to placebo or usual care probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality at 28 to 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.65; 7 RCTs, 29,238 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The absolute reduction in mortality is nine fewer deaths per 10,000 people treated (95% CI 10 fewer to four fewer per 10,000), which we consider clinically insignificant. Molnupiravir may result in little to no difference in hospitalisation (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.12; 6 RCTs, 29,228 participants; low-certainty evidence), symptom resolution by day 14 (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.71; 3 RCTs, 22,400 participants; low-certainty evidence), and symptom resolution by day 28 (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.26; 3 RCTs, 24,728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Four studies reported viral clearance by day 5, which was higher in people receiving molnupiravir compared with those receiving placebo or usual care (RR 3.40, 95% CI 2.15 to 5.36; 3067 participants). The effect size decreased by day 10 (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.34; 2 RCTs, 2438 participants) and indicated little to no difference between molnupiravir and control by day 14 to 15 (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.13; 4 RCTs, 3062 participants). The results at day 28 to 30 again showed higher virus clearance in the molnupiravir arm (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.19; 3 RCTs, 397 participants), although there were few participants in this analysis. Molnupiravir probably results in little to no difference in adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.15; 7 RCTs, 4304 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Molnupiravir results in little to no difference in serious adverse events (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.21; 8 RCTs, 30,009 participants; high-certainty evidence). Inpatients The effect of molnupiravir in inpatients is unclear; substantial heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. Risk of bias and certainty of the evidence We assigned high risk of bias judgements to one of seven RCTs for all-cause mortality, one of six RCTs for hospitalisation, two of three RCTs for symptom resolution at 14 days and 28 days, three of seven RCTs for adverse events, and three of eight RCTs for serious adverse events. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for serious indirectness as well as risk of bias, as the populations across trials differed by vaccination status. There was no serious imprecision identified for any outcome. Publication bias is likely high in this review, as we identified 16 unpublished trials. Six were listed as complete, but only one had available data. In outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19, molnupiravir 800 mg taken orally every 12 hours for five days probably results in little to no difference in all-cause mortality and may result in little to no difference in rates of hospitalisation and symptom resolution. There is evidence of increased viral clearance by day 5, but the clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. There is probably little to no difference in adverse events, and there is little to no difference in serious adverse events, with molnupiravir versus placebo or standard care. Inpatient data are lacking, and there is no evidence of benefit of molnupiravir in this population. Further research involving inpatients may change this.

      "abstract": "Electronic cigarettes (EC) are handheld electronic vaping devices that produce an aerosol by heating a liquid. People who smoke, healthcare providers, and regulators want to know if EC can help people quit smoking, and if they are safe to use for this purpose. This review update was conducted as part of a living systematic review. To examine the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of EC for helping people who smoke tobacco achieve long-term smoking abstinence, in comparison to non-nicotine EC, other smoking cessation treatments, and no treatment. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to 1 March 2025, reference-checked, and contacted study authors. We included trials randomising people who smoked to an EC or control condition. We also included uncontrolled intervention studies where all participants received an EC intervention. Studies had to measure an eligible outcome. Critical outcomes were abstinence from smoking after at least six months, adverse events (AEs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). Important outcomes were biomarkers, toxicants/carcinogens, and longer-term EC use. We used the RoB 1 tool to assess risk of bias for each study and GRADE to assess evidence certainty. We followed standard Cochrane methods for screening and data extraction. Where appropriate, we pooled data using random-effects models to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean differences with 95% CIs. We included 104 completed studies (14 new to this update), representing 30,366 participants, of which 61 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We rated 11 included studies as being at low risk of bias, 70 at high risk (including all non-randomised studies), and the remainder at unclear risk overall. Nicotine EC result in increased quit rates compared to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (high-certainty evidence) (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.88; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 2703 participants). In absolute terms, this might translate to an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 5 more). The rate of occurrence of AEs is probably similar between groups (moderate-certainty evidence (limited by imprecision)) (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.37; I² = 58%; 7 studies, 2241 participants). SAEs were rare, and there is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates differ between groups due to very serious imprecision (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.03; I² = 30%; 8 studies, 2950 participants; low-certainty evidence). Nicotine EC probably result in increased quit rates compared to non-nicotine EC (moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision) (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.70; I² = 0%; 7 studies, 1918 participants). In absolute terms, this might lead to an additional two quitters per 100 (95% CI 0 to 4 more). There is probably little to no difference in the rate of AEs between these groups (moderate-certainty evidence) (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.08; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 840 participants). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differ between groups, due to very serious imprecision (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.73; I² = 0%; 10 studies, 1717 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to behavioural support only or no support, quit rates may be higher for participants randomised to nicotine EC (low-certainty evidence due to risk of bias) (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.25; I² = 13%; 11 studies, 6819 participants). In absolute terms, this represents an additional three quitters per 100 (95% CI 2 to 5 more). There was some evidence that (non-serious) AEs may be more common in people randomised to nicotine EC (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.55; I² = 66%; 8 studies, 2485 participants; very low-certainty evidence) but the evidence is uncertain and, again, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether rates of SAEs differed between groups (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.29; I² = 0%; 15 studies, 4716 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Data from non-randomised studies were consistent with RCT data. The most commonly reported AEs were throat/mouth irritation, headache, cough, and nausea, which tended to dissipate with continued EC use. Very few studies reported data on other outcomes or comparisons; hence, evidence for these is limited, with CIs often encompassing both clinically significant harm and benefit. There is high-certainty evidence that nicotine EC increase quit rates compared to NRT, and moderate-certainty evidence that they probably increase quit rates compared to EC without nicotine. Evidence comparing nicotine EC with behavioural support or no support also suggests benefit, but is less certain due to risk of bias inherent in the study designs. CIs were, for the most part, wide for data on AEs, SAEs, and other safety markers, with no evidence of a difference in AEs between nicotine and non-nicotine EC nor between nicotine EC and NRT, but low-certainty evidence for increased AEs compared with behavioural support/no support. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect evidence of serious harm from nicotine EC, but longer, larger trials are needed to fully evaluate safety. Included studies tested regulated nicotine-containing EC; illicit products and/or products containing other active substances (e.g. tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) may have different harm profiles. The main limitation of the evidence base remains imprecision for some comparisons and for safety outcomes due to the relatively small number of RCTs contributing, often with low event rates. Further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide up-to-date information to decision-makers, this is a living systematic review. We run and screen searches monthly, with the review updated when relevant new evidence becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the review's current status.

CIs were, for the most part, wide for data on AEs, SAEs, and other safety markers, with no evidence of a difference in AEs between nicotine and non-nicotine EC nor between nicotine EC and NRT, but low-certainty evidence for increased AEs compared with behavioural support/no support. Overall incidence of SAEs was low across all study arms. We did not detect evidence of serious harm from nicotine EC, but longer, larger trials are needed to fully evaluate safety. Included studies tested regulated nicotine-containing EC; illicit products and/or products containing other active substances (e.g. tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)) may have different harm profiles. The main limitation of the evidence base remains imprecision for some comparisons and for safety outcomes due to the relatively small number of RCTs contributing, often with low event rates. Further RCTs are underway. To ensure the review continues to provide up-to-date information to decision-makers, this is a living systematic review. We run and screen searches monthly, with the review updated when relevant new evidence becomes available. Please refer to the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the review's current status."

A total of eight randomized controlled trials comprising 88,526 participants were included. Enrollment age ranged from age 50 to 70 years; follow-up duration ranged from 7.3 to 12.3 years. For every 1,000 persons screened, 3.4 years (95%=CI 2.2, 5.1) passed before 1 death from lung cancer was prevented (ARR=0.001). The time to prevent one lung cancer death per 2,000 persons screened (ARR=0.0005) was 2.2 years (95% CI=1.4, 3.4); per 500 persons screened (ARR=0.002), it was 5.2 years (95%=CI 3.7, 7.3).

      "abstract": "The first month postprimary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is the highest risk period for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including stent thrombosis. Ticagrelor and double-dose clopidogrel are effective antiplatelet therapies, but no head-to-head comparison exists in this setting. The authors sought to evaluate the efficacy of ticagrelor over twice-daily clopidogrel in reducing MACE events within the first 1 month postprimary PCI. TADCLOT (Twice-A-Day CLOpidogrel vs Ticagrelor), a double-blind, randomized superiority trial at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi, Pakistan (February 19, 2024 to January 30, 2025), randomized 2,201 patients with STEMI within 24 hours of primary PCI 1:1 to ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose, 90 mg twice a day) or twice-daily clopidogrel (600-mg loading dose, 75 mg twice a day) for 1 month. The primary endpoint was MACEs (death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, stroke, or target lesion revascularization) at 1 month, analyzed by intention to treat. Secondary endpoints were individual MACE components and clinically significant bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium [BARC] type 2, 3, or 5). Among 2,201 randomized patients, MACEs occurred in 24 (2.2%) ticagrelor patients vs 32 (2.9%) in twice-daily clopidogrel patients (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.44-1.27; P = 0.28; absolute risk difference: -0.7%; 95% CI: -2.05 to 0.60). Cardiovascular death or definite stent thrombosis occurred in 21 (1.9%) vs 27 (2.5%) patients (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.44-1.37). Clinically significant bleeding (BARC type 2, 3, or 5) occurred in 6 patients (0.5%) with ticagrelor vs 4 (0.4%) with clopidogrel (HR: 1.50; 95% CI: 0.42-5.31). Major bleeding (BARC type 3 or 5) was infrequent and similar between the groups: 3 patients (0.3%) in the ticagrelor arm and 2 (0.2%) in the clopidogrel arm (HR: 1.50; 95% CI: 0.25-8.97). At both 7 (HR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.04-0.5; P = 0.002) and 14 days (HR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.23-0.91; P = 0.02), MACEs were significantly lower with ticagrelor compared with twice-daily clopidogrel, although these differences were no longer statistically significant at 30 days. Ticagrelor was not superior to twice-daily clopidogrel in reducing MACEs at 1 month after primary PCI, and bleeding rates were similar. However, event rates were lower than anticipated, and ticagrelor significantly reduced MACEs within the first 2 weeks compared with twice-daily clopidogrel.

We aimed to explore the effects of empagliflozin on a range of kidney outcomes in these population subtypes. In this meta-analysis, we used individual-level data from 23 340 participants in four large placebo-controlled trials (EMPA-REG OUTCOME, EMPEROR-Reduced, EMPEROR-Preserved, and EMPA-KIDNEY) to assess the effects of empagliflozin on conventional and exploratory acute and chronic kidney outcomes. We then assessed whether effects varied by predicted size of the acute eGFR dip on treatment initiation or among other key population subtypes using tests for heterogeneity and trend. The individual-level data were requested from Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim, Germany). Compared with placebo, allocation to empagliflozin reduced the risk of a marker of acute kidney injury (a ≥50% increase in serum creatinine in consecutive follow-up samples) by 20% (hazard ratio 0·80 [95% CI 0·72-0·88]; 1573 outcomes), acute kidney injury adverse events by 27% (0·73 [0·63-0·85]; 694 outcomes), a categorical chronic kidney disease progression outcome by 30% (0·70 [0·63-0·78]; 1403 outcomes), and kidney failure by 34% (0·66 [0·55-0·79]; 490 outcomes).

These kidney benefits were similar in subgroups divided by predicted size of acute eGFR dip, and were present irrespective of diabetes or heart failure status, level of kidney function, or albuminuria. SGLT2 inhibition reduces risk of acute and chronic kidney outcomes irrespective of the size of the acute dip in eGFR.

We searched databases on PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science for updates of the most recent review by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Evidence-to-Recommendations for each disease, which was performed during the 2023-2024 period. Outcomes included vaccine efficacy and effectiveness against hospitalization, other clinical end points, and safety. Of 17,263 identified references, 511 studies met the inclusion criteria. Covid-19 mRNA vaccines against the XBB.1.5 subvariant had pooled vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization of 46% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34 to 55; from cohort studies) and 50% (95% CI, 43 to 57; from case-control studies) among adults and 37% (95% CI, 29 to 44) among immunocompromised adults. In a case-control study, vaccines against the KP.2 subvariant showed an effectiveness of 68% (95% CI, 42 to 82). Maternal RSV vaccination (for infant protection), nirsevimab for infants, and RSV vaccines in adults who were 60 years of age or older showed vaccine effectiveness of 68% or more against hospitalization. Influenza vaccination had a pooled vaccine effectiveness of 48% (95% CI, 39 to 55) in adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years and 67% (95% CI, 58 to 75) in children against hospitalization. Safety profiles were consistent with previous evaluations. The diagnosis of myocarditis associated with Covid-19 vaccines occurred at rates of 1.3 to 3.1 per 100,000 doses in male adolescents, with lower risk associated with longer dosing intervals. The RSVPreF vaccine was associated with 18.2 excess cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome per million doses in older adults; a significant association with preterm birth was not observed when the vaccine was administered at 32 to 36 weeks' gestation. Ongoing peer-reviewed evidence supports the safety and effectiveness of immunizations against Covid-19, RSV, and influenza during the 2025-2026 season.

Influenza vaccination had a pooled vaccine effectiveness of 48% (95% CI, 39 to 55) in adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years and 67% (95% CI, 58 to 75) in children against hospitalization. Safety profiles were consistent with previous evaluations. The diagnosis of myocarditis associated with Covid-19 vaccines occurred at rates of 1.3 to 3.1 per 100,000 doses in male adolescents, with lower risk associated with longer dosing intervals. The RSVPreF vaccine was associated with 18.2 excess cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome per million doses in older adults; a significant association with preterm birth was not observed when the vaccine was administered at 32 to 36 weeks' gestation."

Because deaths from prostate cancer are expected to rise worldwide owing to increased life expectancy and population growth, a final analysis of the long-term outcomes of prostate cancer screening is essential to understanding the benefits and harms of PSA testing. We updated the findings from ERSPC, a multicenter, randomized study conducted across eight European countries with a focus on a predefined core age group of 162,236 men who were 55 to 69 years of age at the time of randomization. Participants were randomly assigned to the screening group and offered repeated PSA testing or to the control group and not invited for screening. The primary outcome was prostate cancer mortality. After a median follow-up of 23 years, prostate cancer mortality was 13% lower in the screening group (rate ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 0.95), and the absolute risk reduction was 0.22% (95% CI, 0.10 to 0.34). The cumulative incidence of prostate cancer was higher in the screening group than in the control group (rate ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.33). At a median of 23 years of follow-up, one death from prostate cancer was prevented for every 456 men (95% CI, 306 to 943) who were invited for screening, and one death from prostate cancer was averted for every 12 men (95% CI, 8 to 26) in whom prostate cancer was diagnosed, as compared with one death from prostate cancer prevented for every 628 men (95% CI, 419 to 1481) and one death averted for every 18 men (95% CI, 12 to 45) at 16 years of follow-up. Long-term follow-up confirms a sustained reduction in deaths from prostate cancer with PSA testing, alongside an improved harm-benefit ratio. Future screening strategies should adopt risk-based approaches to minimize overdiagnosis while maintaining clinical benefits.

      "abstract": "Boarding is the practice of holding patients in the emergency department (ED) or a temporary location after the decision to admit or transfer has been made. Previous literature suggests that ED Length of Stay (LOS), prolonged in boarded patients, is linked to worse outcomes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (SR/MA) to evaluate the differences in mortality and hospital LOS in ED-boarding (EDB) and non-ED boarding (non-EDB) critically ill patients in U.S. EDs. A systematic search was performed with medical librarians using major health science databases from 2012 through December 2024. Eligible studies included observational or randomized trials involving adults comparing EDB and non-EDB groups in U.S. EDs. Only full-text English-language articles were included. Outcomes were mortality and hospital LOS. We used random-effects meta-analysis to compare the outcomes. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I value while publication bias was assessed via the funnel plot. We identified 3139 studies and included 17, comprising 407,178 ED patients: 194,814 (48 %) EDB and 212,364 (52 %) non-EDB. 87.4 % of patients came from urban academic Emergency Departments with a resuscitation unit or team. Median ED LOS was 6.5 h (IQR 5.18-8.1) for EDB and 4.2 h (IQR 2.38-5.75) for non-EDB (p < 0.01). EDB patients had similar all-cause mortality (OR 1.06, 95 % CI 0.94-1.19, I = 69 %, p = 0.38) and hospital LOS (mean difference 0.38 days, 95 % CI -0.75-1.50, I = 61 %, p = 0.51). Funnel plot suggested publication bias favoring higher mortality in EDB. Our SR/MA suggested that EDB was associated with a non-statistically significant increase in mortality and hospital LOS compared to non-EDB. High heterogeneity and inconsistent boarding definitions were also noted.",

This study systematically evaluated the neuroprotective effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) based on randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence, aiming to provide key evidence-based insights for optimizing diabetes management strategies. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases to identify studies investigating the impact of GLP-1RAs on cognitive function in T2DM patients, with the search timeframe extending up to July 2025. The analysis focused on RCTs comparing the effects of GLP-1RAs versus placebo (or conventional therapy) on neurocognitive function in T2DM patients. Based on the inclusion criteria, 18 RCTs involving 11 114 participants were included in the primary meta-analysis. Pooled results demonstrated that, compared to the placebo group, GLP-1RA treatment significantly increased Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores by a weighted mean difference (WMD) of 1.33 (95% CI: 0.67-1.99; I = 82%) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores by a WMD of 1.70 (95% CI: 0.83-2.56; I = 96%). The effect size on MMSE was significantly greater with long-term GLP-1RA use (≥24 weeks) compared to short-term use (<24 weeks) (mean difference = 3.74; t = 6.52, df = 269, p < 0.0001; Cohen's d = 0.79). Sensitivity analyses yielded results closely aligned with the primary analysis, indicating robust stability. Jadad scale assessment confirmed that all included studies achieved a score ≥3. Current evidence indicates that GLP-1 RA-based therapy may improve cognitive function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with placebo. Furthermore, long-term administration or early initiation of GLP-1 RA treatment may offer greater cognitive benefits.",

This review aimed to systematically synthesise and analyse current evidence on the diagnostic utility of speech-based biomarkers for identifying MCI. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, Ovid Medline and PsycINFO databases were searched up to April 2025 without restrictions on language, article status or year.

In this multicenter, open-label, noninferiority trial, we randomly assigned patients who had shock and had been admitted to an intensive care unit within the past 24 hours to receive early insertion (<4 hours after randomization) of an arterial catheter (invasive strategy) or to be monitored with an automated brachial cuff (noninvasive strategy). Insertion of an arterial catheter was allowed later in patients assigned to the noninvasive-strategy group who met prespecified safety criteria. The primary outcome was death from any cause at day 28 (noninferiority margin, 5 percentage points). Adverse events of special interest related to the blood-pressure-monitoring device that was used were recorded, as was patient-reported pain or discomfort related to the ongoing presence of the device. A total of 1010 patients underwent randomization; 504 patients assigned to the noninvasive-strategy group and 502 assigned to the invasive-strategy group were included in the analyses. A total of 74 patients (14.7%) in the noninvasive-strategy group and 493 (98.2%) in the invasive-strategy group underwent insertion of an arterial catheter. Death within 28 days occurred in 173 patients (34.3%) in the noninvasive-strategy group and 185 (36.9%) in the invasive-strategy group (adjusted risk difference, -3.2 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -8.9 to 2.5; P = 0.006 for noninferiority). Results of per-protocol analyses were similar in the two groups. A total of 66 patients (13.1%) in the noninvasive-strategy group and 45 (9.0%) in the invasive-strategy group had at least 1 day of pain or discomfort related to the ongoing presence of the blood-pressure-monitoring device. Hematoma or hemorrhage related to the arterial catheter occurred in 5 patients (1.0%) in the noninvasive-strategy group and 41 patients (8.2%) in the invasive-strategy group.

We randomly assigned participants 45 to 85 years of age with knee pain, osteoarthritis, and meniscal tear to one of four groups: home exercise (3-month home-exercise program), home exercise plus text messages to encourage exercise adherence, home exercise plus text messages plus sham physical therapy (in-clinic sham manual therapy and sham ultrasound therapy), and home exercise plus text messages plus standard physical therapy (supervised strengthening, functional, and stretching exercises and manual therapy). The primary outcome was the change in the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain subscore (range, 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more pain) between baseline and 3 months, with adjustment for trial site, baseline KOOS pain subscore, and radiographic grade. A total of 879 participants underwent randomization (mean [±SD] age, 59.2±7.8 years). The difference in the 3-month change in the KOOS pain subscore between home exercise and home exercise plus text messages was -0.1 points (98.3% confidence interval [CI], -3.8 to 3.7) and between home exercise and home exercise plus text messages plus standard physical therapy was 2.5 points (98.3% CI, -1.3 to 6.2); the difference between home exercise plus text messages and home exercise plus text messages plus standard physical therapy was 2.5 points (98.3% CI, -1.4 to 6.5).

Vericiguat reduced risk of mortality but not HHF. In this ambulatory compensated cohort, time to first HHF may underestimate the overall worsening HF burden by failing to consider the high proportion of outpatient worsening HF events. This study aimed to determine the effect of vericiguat on the overall risk of worsening HF by incorporating the entire patient experience of worsening outpatient and inpatient HF episodes. VICTOR was a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing the effect of vericiguat in ambulatory patients with HFrEF who had not experienced recent worsening (defined as HHF admission within 6 months or outpatient intravenous diuretic use within 3 months) and were on a background of high use of contemporary guideline therapy. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death or HHF. The current analysis provides detailed effects of vericiguat on overall worsening HF in both the inpatient and outpatient settings, including urgent care visits for intravenous diuretics or outpatient oral diuretic initiation or intensification. A total of 6,105 participants were randomized. Outpatient worsening HF was more common as the first worsening HF event (n = 851, 59.3%), compared with HHF (n = 507, 35.4%) or urgent HF visits (n = 76, 5.3%). Outpatient oral diuretic initiation or intensification was associated with increased mortality (RR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.47-1.94; P < 0.001). Overall worsening HF occurred in 686 participants (22.5%) in the vericiguat group and 748 participants (24.8%) in the placebo group (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.81-1.00; P = 0.047). The composite of all-cause death and overall worsening HF occurred in 917 participants (30.0%) in the vericiguat group and 1,004 participants (32.9%) in the placebo group (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82-0.98; P = 0.016).

We searched multiple electronic databases from inception through August 14, 2024, to identify randomized controlled trials in adults with moderate-to-severe CD, comparing advanced therapies (eg, tumor necrosis factor antagonists, vedolizumab, interleukin 12/23, or interleukin 23p19 antagonists, and/or Janus kinase inhibitors) with placebo or another active comparator. Our primary outcomes were induction and maintenance of clinical remission; analyses were stratified by biologic therapy exposure status. We performed a network meta-analysis using a frequentist approach and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise certainty of evidence. We identified 28 trials of induction therapy and 22 trials of maintenance therapy of advanced therapies in patients with moderate-to-severe CD. In biologic-naïve patients, moderate-to-high certainty evidence supported the use of infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab, and guselkumab, and low certainty evidence supported the use of certolizumab pegol and upadacitinib over no treatment for inducing remission. Among active comparators, moderate-to-high certainty evidence supported the use of adalimumab and ustekinumab compared with certolizumab pegol and upadacitinib. Among patients with prior exposure to biologics, moderate-to-high certainty evidence supported the use of adalimumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, guselkumab, and upadacitinib, and low certainty evidence supported the use of vedolizumab and mirikizumab, over no treatment, for inducing remission. Among active comparators, moderate certainty evidence supported the use of risankizumab and guselkumab compared with vedolizumab and ustekinumab.

To determine if the proportion of patients with a platelet response is significantly greater in patients with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia treated with eltrombopag than in those treated with standard therapy (first-line treatments). This phase 3, randomized clinical trial enrolled patients (aged 1-<18 years) with newly diagnosed primary immune thrombocytopenia (platelet count <30 × 109/L who required pharmacological treatment but did not have severe bleeding or need a rapid increase in platelet count) from May 7, 2019, to January 25, 2024, at 23 centers participating in the Pediatric ITP Consortium of North America. Final follow-up occurred on February 26, 2025. Eltrombopag was administered orally based on a standard dosing schedule (n = 78) vs standard therapy (investigator choice of glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or anti-D immunoglobulin) (n = 40). The primary outcome was a sustained platelet response defined as 3 or more of 4 platelet counts greater than 50 × 109/L during weeks 6 to 12 without rescue treatment. The secondary outcomes included bleeding scores, change in health-related quality of life, and serious adverse events.

Overall, there was no between-group difference in the number and type of adverse events. In pediatric patients with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia requiring pharmacological treatment, eltrombopag resulted in a higher rate of sustained platelet response compared with standard therapy.

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) to treat uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Concerns about artemisinin resistance have led to global initiatives to develop new partner drugs to protect artemisinin derivatives in ACT. Pyronaridine-artesunate (PY-AS) is a novel ACT first recommended by the WHO in 2022. To evaluate the benefits of pyronaridine-artesunate compared to alternative ACTs for treating people with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria, and to evaluate the harms of pyronaridine-artesunate and other pyronaridine treatments compared to alternative treatments. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the ISRCTN registry for ongoing or recently completed trials. The date of the last search was 31 July 2024. For the efficacy analysis, we included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pyronaridine-artesunate for treating adults and children with uncomplicated P falciparum malaria compared to any other WHO-recommended ACT. For the safety analysis, we included RCTs that used pyronaridine alone or in combination with any other antimalarials. Our primary outcomes were treatment failure at days 28 and 42 (PCR-adjusted and -unadjusted), serious adverse events, adverse events leading to withdrawal from treatment, and elevated liver function tests. Secondary outcomes included early treatment failure, other adverse events, cost-effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability. We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess bias in the RCTs. Two review authors independently extracted all data and assessed the certainty of the evidence. We meta-analyzed data to calculate risk ratios (RRs) for treatment failures between comparisons, and for safety outcomes between and across comparisons. We included 15 studies (14 RCTs reporting safety and efficacy, 1 quasi-experimental study reporting acceptability and feasibility) with 7295 participants. For a separate safety analysis, we included 10 non-randomized studies (NRS) with 11,783 participants. Efficacy analysis (RCTs) We evaluated pyronaridine-artesunate versus the following. - Artemether-lumefantrine. Pyronaridine-artesunate probably performs better for PCR-adjusted failures at day 28 (RR 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.85; 5 RCTs, 3213 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); for unadjusted failures at day 28 (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.52; 5 RCTs, 3314 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and for unadjusted failures at day 42 (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.82; 4 RCTs, 3080 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). For PCR-adjusted failures at day 42, there is probably little or no difference between groups (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.51; 4 RCTs, 2575 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). - Artesunate-amodiaquine. Pyronaridine-artesunate may perform better for PCR-adjusted failures at day 28 (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.77; 1 RCT, 1245 participants; low-certainty evidence, CI crosses line of no effect); probably performs better for unadjusted failures at day 28 (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.81; 1 RCT, 1257 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); may make little or no difference for PCR-adjusted failures at day 42 (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.83; 1 RCT, 1091 participants; low-certainty evidence); and probably makes little or no difference for unadjusted failures at day 42 (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.23; 1 RCT, 1235 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). - Artesunate-mefloquine. Pyronaridine-artesunate may perform better for PCR-adjusted failures at day 28 (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.05; 1 RCT, 1117 participants; low-certainty evidence, CI crosses line of no effect); probably performs better for unadjusted failures at day 28 (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.78; 1 RCT, 1120 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); may make little or no difference for unadjusted failures at day 42 (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.31; 1 RCT, 1059 participants; low-certainty evidence); but may lead to higher PCR-adjusted failures at day 42 (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.90 to 3.57; 1 RCT, 1037 participants; low-certainty evidence). Safety analysis in adults and children (RCTs) Pyronaridine-artesunate was associated with raised liver enzymes compared to other antimalarials: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (RR 3.59, 95% CI 1.76 to 7.33; 8 RCTs, 6669 participants; high-certainty evidence) and aspartate transaminase (AST) (RR 2.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.41; 8 RCTs, 6669 participants; high-certainty evidence). There was no such effect with bilirubin (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.18; 7 RCTs, 6384 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was one reported case in which raised ALT occurred with raised bilirubin. No study reported severe drug-induced liver injury. Safety analysis in pregnant women (RCTs) We do not know if malaria testing and treatment with pyronaridine-artesunate for positive cases resulted in any difference in serious adverse effects for pregnant women compared to intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.15; 1 RCT, 250 participants; very-low certainty evidence). Acceptability and feasibility One study determined that the adherence rate to a three-day treatment with pyronaridine-artesunate in children aged under five years was 85.3%. Limited qualitative data suggests pyronaridine-artesunate is acceptable to patients and their carers. Certainty of the evidence and limitations The studies included in this review ranged between very low-certainty and high-certainty evidence, largely due to imprecision of the effect estimate with wide CIs, and indirectness, given that children under five years were under-represented (especially in Asia). We did not identify any evidence of cost-effectiveness. Pyronaridine-artesunate was efficacious against uncomplicated P falciparum malaria; achieved a PCR-adjusted treatment failure rate of less than 8% at days 28 and 42; and may be at least as good as artesunate-amodiaquine and artesunate-mefloquine (based on 1 RCT per drug) and may be at least as good as, or better than, artemether-lumefantrine. Pyronaridine-artesunate increases the risk of episodes of abnormally raised ALT and AST compared to other studied therapeutics.

          "text": "Efficacy analysis (RCTs) We evaluated pyronaridine-artesunate versus the following. - Artemether-lumefantrine. Pyronaridine-artesunate probably performs better for PCR-adjusted failures at day 28 (RR 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.85; 5 RCTs, 3213 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); for unadjusted failures at day 28 (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.52; 5 RCTs, 3314 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and for unadjusted failures at day 42 (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.82; 4 RCTs, 3080 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). For PCR-adjusted failures at day 42, there is probably little or no difference between groups (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.51; 4 RCTs, 2575 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). - Artesunate-amodiaquine. Pyronaridine-artesunate may perform better for PCR-adjusted failures at day 28 (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.77; 1 RCT, 1245 participants; low-certainty evidence, CI crosses line of no effect); probably performs better for unadjusted failures at day 28 (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.81; 1 RCT, 1257 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); may make little or no difference for PCR-adjusted failures at day 42 (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.83; 1 RCT, 1091 participants; low-certainty evidence); and probably makes little or no difference for unadjusted failures at day 42 (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.23; 1 RCT, 1235 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). - Artesunate-mefloquine. Pyronaridine-artesunate may perform better for PCR-adjusted failures at day 28 (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.05; 1 RCT, 1117 participants; low-certainty evidence, CI crosses line of no effect); probably performs better for unadjusted failures at day 28 (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.78; 1 RCT, 1120 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); may make little or no difference for unadjusted failures at day 42 (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.31; 1 RCT, 1059 participants; low-certainty evidence); but may lead to higher PCR-adjusted failures at day 42 (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.90 to 3.57; 1 RCT, 1037 participants; low-certainty evidence). Safety analysis in adults and children (RCTs) Pyronaridine-artesunate was associated with raised liver enzymes compared to other antimalarials: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (RR 3.59, 95% CI 1.76 to 7.33; 8 RCTs, 6669 participants; high-certainty evidence) and aspartate transaminase (AST) (RR 2.22, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.41; 8 RCTs, 6669 participants; high-certainty evidence). There was no such effect with bilirubin (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.18; 7 RCTs, 6384 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was one reported case in which raised ALT occurred with raised bilirubin. No study reported severe drug-induced liver injury. Safety analysis in pregnant women (RCTs) We do not know if malaria testing and treatment with pyronaridine-artesunate for positive cases resulted in any difference in serious adverse effects for pregnant women compared to intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.15; 1 RCT, 250 participants; very-low certainty evidence). Acceptability and feasibility One study determined that the adherence rate to a three-day treatment with pyronaridine-artesunate in children aged under five years was 85.3%. Limited qualitative data suggests pyronaridine-artesunate is acceptable to patients and their carers. Certainty of the evidence and limitations The studies included in this review ranged between very low-certainty and high-certainty evidence, largely due to imprecision of the effect estimate with wide CIs, and indirectness, given that children under five years were under-represented (especially in Asia). We did not identify any evidence of cost-effectiveness."

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 2010-June 2025) for randomized-controlled trials or cohort studies enrolling adults (age ≥18 years) with primary or metastatic brain tumors receiving therapeutic DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, betrixaban, and dabigatran) vs LMWH (enoxaparin, dalteparin, nadroparin, and tinzaparin). Studies limited to prophylactic dosing or non-brain tumor patients were excluded. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs were calculated using a restricted random-effects model. Heterogeneity () and bias were evaluated, with prespecified subgroups (tumor type, follow-up duration, and study quality) and sensitivity analyses. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42025635334). Among 762 publications identified, 10 retrospective cohort studies (1,572 patients: 645 DOAC, 895 LMWH) were included. Patients' mean or median age ranged 60.4-67 years (DOAC) vs 53-64 years (LMWH), with follow-up durations ranging from 3 to 12 months. Patients with primary or metastatic brain tumors receiving DOACs had a statistically significantly lower risk of any ICH compared with LMWH (RR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.29-0.87;  = 0.01,  = 49.50%). Reduction was more pronounced in 3 studies with three-month follow-up (RR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.57;  < 0.01,  < 0.01%).

Leave-one-out analyses confirmed robustness, and cumulative meta-analysis demonstrated stable estimates with narrowing CIs. Egger ( = 0.19) and Begg ( = 0.59) tests showed no statistical evidence of publication bias. In the current meta-analysis, DOACs were associated with significantly lower ICH risk than LMWH in patients with anticoagulated brain tumor, particularly those with primary brain tumors. Findings support DOACs as a safe anticoagulant in arterial and venous thromboembolism. Given observational designs with inherent confounding, findings warrant cautious interpretation.",

This update of the 2013 Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care guideline provides an evidence-based recommendation about instrument-based screening for depression. For this update, we commissioned a systematic review on benefits and harms of instrument-based screening (i.e., using a screening tool) for depression among adults. The systematic review covered relevant literature from October 2018 to May 2020, updated to January 2025 for trials, and to March 2025 for trial registries. We examined patient values and preferences via patient engagement surveys and focus groups; we engaged content experts and other interest holders at key points throughout the project. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to determine the certainty of evidence for each outcome and strength of the recommendation; adhered to the Guidelines International Network principles of managing competing interests; and followed Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation, and Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and the Public reporting guidance. We recommend against screening all adults aged 18 years and older for depression using questionnaires (strong recommendation, very low-certainty evidence), based on evidence suggesting that depression screening using a screening tool has little to no effect on health. This recommendation does not apply to adults with a personal history, current diagnosis, or clinical suspicion of a diagnosis of depression or another mental health disorder. It does apply to those who may be at an elevated risk of depression. The recommendation against screening adults for depression using a screening tool emphasizes the importance of good clinical care, where clinicians ask about their patients' well-being and remain vigilant for symptoms and signs of depression.",

We report a prespecified analysis of the SELECT trial on the relationships between baseline adiposity measures, treatment-induced adiposity changes, and subsequent MACE risk. Patients aged at least 45 years, with a BMI of at least 27 kg/m were enrolled in 41 countries (804 sites) and randomised 1:1 to once-weekly semaglutide 2·4 mg or placebo. The primary outcome was time to first MACE (composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke). Adiposity measures included weight and waist circumference. In this analysis, risk of MACE occurring after 20 weeks was assessed between patients by adiposity changes in the first 20 weeks and, in a separate analysis, all in-trial MACE were assessed between patients by adiposity changes over 104 weeks. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03574597. Semaglutide significantly reduced MACE incidence compared with placebo among 17 604 patients enrolled in SELECT, with consistent benefits across all baseline weight and waist circumference categories. In the semaglutide group, analyses for linear trends showed lower baseline bodyweight and waist circumference were associated with lower incidence of MACE-an average 4% reduction in risk per 5 kg lower bodyweight (hazard ratio [HR] 0·96 [95% CI 0·94-0·99]; p=0·001) and per 5 cm smaller waist circumference (0·96 [0·93-0·99]; p=0·004). In the placebo group, lower baseline waist circumference (0·96 [0·94-0·99]; p=0·007), but not bodyweight (0·99 [0·97-1·01]; p=0·28), was associated with a lower MACE risk and weight loss was paradoxically associated with increased MACE risk. In those receiving semaglutide there was no linear trend linking weight loss at week 20 to subsequent MACE risk, but greater waist circumference reduction at week 20 was associated with lower subsequent MACE risk, and waist circumference reduction by week 104 was associated with lower in-trial risk of MACE. An estimated 33% of the observed benefit on MACE was mediated through waist circumference reduction (HR 0·86 [95% CI 0·77-0·97] after adjustment for time-varying changes in waist circumference). The cardioprotective effects of semaglutide were independent of baseline adiposity and weight loss and had only a small association with waist circumference, suggesting some mechanisms for benefit beyond adiposity reduction.

Closed-loop insulin systems improve glycemia outside of pregnancy but have had limited testing in pregnancy. To assess the efficacy of a closed-loop system in pregnancy. Open-label trial enrolling pregnant women with type 1 diabetes at 14 clinical centers in Canada and Australia before 14 weeks' gestation with follow-up until 6 weeks postpartum. Enrollment occurred between June 2021 and July 2024 and follow-up was completed in March 2025. Participants were randomized 1:1 to closed-loop therapy (n = 46) or standard care (insulin pump or multiple daily insulin injections) (n = 45) with continuous glucose monitoring. The primary outcome was the percentage of time spent in the pregnancy-specific glucose range (63-140 mg/dL), measured by continuous glucose monitoring from 16 to 34 weeks' gestation. Among 94 enrolled participants, 3 experienced pregnancy loss prior to randomization, 91 were randomized (mean age, 31.7 [SD, 5.2] years; early pregnancy hemoglobin A1c, 7.4% [SD, 1.0%]), and 88 were included in the primary analysis. The mean percentage of time spent in the pregnancy-specific glucose range from 16 to 34 weeks' gestation was 65.4% in the closed-loop group and 50.3% in the standard care group (mean adjusted difference, 12.5 [95% CI, 9.5-15.6] percentage points; P < .001). There was 1 episode of severe hypoglycemia in the closed-loop group, and there were 2 episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis in the closed-loop group and 1 in the standard care group. Pregnant women with type 1 diabetes using a closed-loop system spent significantly more time in the pregnancy-specific glucose range than those receiving standard care. These findings support the use of this closed-loop system in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04902378.",

These shifts can influence the risk-benefit balance of interventions such as implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), which are designed to prevent sudden cardiac death. Long-term follow-up is therefore essential to determine whether early benefits are sustained, attenuated, or lost over time. This study sought to examine the long-term effect of primary prevention ICD implantation, compared with usual clinical care, in patients with nonischemic HFrEF enrolled in the DANISH (Danish Study To Assess the Efficacy of ICDs in Patients With Nonischemic Systolic Heart Failure on Mortality) trial. The DANISH trial enrolled 1,116 patients with nonischemic HFrEF, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%, NYHA functional class II-III (class IV if cardiac resynchronization therapy was planned), and elevated natriuretic peptide levels. The primary outcome was all-cause death, and secondary outcomes were cardiovascular death and sudden cardiovascular death. In this study with extended follow-up, patients were followed until death or January 31, 2024, whichever came first. During a median follow-up of 13.2 years (Q1-Q3: 11.6-14.6 years), 294 patients (52.9%) in the ICD group and 299 (53.4%) in the control group died. Compared with usual clinical care, ICD implantation did not significantly reduce the long-term rate of all-cause death (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.82-1.13), but it did reduce the long-term rate of sudden cardiovascular death (HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.36-0.80). The effect of ICD implantation on all-cause death was consistent regardless of age (P = 0.89). However, age significantly modified the effect of ICD implantation on sudden cardiovascular death, such that ICD implantation reduced the rate of this outcome in patients ≤70 years (HR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.23-0.62), but not in those >70 years (HR: 1.27; 95% CI: 0.56-2.89; P = 0.01).

      "abstract": "The optimal haemoglobin threshold for use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients remains an active area of research. Blood is a limited resource, and there are concerns about risks, including transmitted infections. If a liberal transfusion strategy does not improve clinical outcomes, or if it is equivalent, then adopting a more restrictive approach should be recognised as the standard of care. The aim of this review update was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes for participants randomised to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all clinical conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin concentration as a threshold for transfusion (most commonly, 7.0 g/dL to 8.0 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin concentration to direct transfusion (most commonly, 9.0 g/dL to 10.0 g/dL). Increasingly, investigators are considering other strategies including physiological triggers (i.e. central venous oxygen saturation), alone or in combination with such thresholds, to determine when a transfusion is indicated, so it is important to assess this growing body of evidence in tandem. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Transfusion Evidence Library, Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index, trial registries and PubMed on 14 October 2024. We checked reference lists of published reviews and papers for additional trials. We included randomised trials of surgical or medical participants that recruited adults or children. We excluded studies that focused on preterm neonates. Eligible trials assigned intervention groups based on different transfusion strategies or thresholds, usually defined by a haemoglobin concentration below which a RBC transfusion would be administered. We included trials in which investigators had allocated participants to higher thresholds or more liberal transfusion strategies compared to more restrictive ones, which might include no transfusion. We used standard Cochrane methods. We pooled risk ratios across trials using a random-effects model. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool, and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as being in the 'restrictive transfusion' group and those randomly allocated to the higher transfusion threshold as being in the 'liberal transfusion' group. Adult threshold comparison We included 61 trials (27,639 participants), across a range of clinical contexts: orthopaedic, cardiac or vascular surgery; critical care; neurocritical care; gastrointestinal bleeding; trauma; acute myocardial infarction; haematological malignancies and postpartum haemorrhage. The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group in most trials was between 7.0 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL. The main outcomes were exposure to blood transfusion, 30-day mortality, neurologic function, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebral vascular accident, infection and thromboembolism. Studies were generally at low risk of bias. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving at least one RBC transfusion by 42% when combining all clinical contexts (risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 0.65; high-certainty evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 97%), reflecting diversity in the strength of estimates, not the efficacy of the policy. When combining all clinical contexts, restrictive transfusion strategies did not modify the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14; 44 studies, 22,575 participants; high-certainty evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed including myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism or infection (moderate to high-certainty evidence). There were two exceptions in clinical populations. In gastrointestinal bleeding, 30-day mortality was lower with a restrictive transfusion strategy (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.95; 4 studies, 1574 participants). In critically ill patients with brain injury, unfavourable neurological outcome at 6 to 12 months was lower with a liberal transfusion strategy (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.22; 4 studies, 2297 participants) (moderate-certainty evidence). Transfusion-specific reactions are uncommon, but occurred more frequently with the liberal strategy (Peto odds ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.62; 18 studies, 11,505 participants). Paediatric threshold comparison We included eight trials (2764 participants), across a limited range of clinical contexts (critical care, cardiac surgery, haematological malignancies and severe malarial anaemia). The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive group in critical care and haematological malignancies trials was between 6.5 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL, and between 7.0 g/dL and 9 g/dL in cardiac surgery trials, depending on the cardiac abnormality and stage of repair. Studies were generally at low risk of bias. There was no clear difference in 30-day mortality between restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies, although confidence intervals were wide (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.08; 7 studies, 2571 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was moderate-certainty evidence of no clear difference between threshold strategies for infection; very low-certainty evidence of little to no difference for thrombosis and very low-certainty evidence of little to no difference for the outcomes multiple organ dysfunction and cerebrovascular accident. Physiological triggers Nine trials in adults (3818 participants) and one trial in children (100 participants) were identified. These tested different interventions and measures of physiological parameters in diverse clinical populations. The risk of bias was variable. Meta-analysis was not appropriate due to heterogeneity. A restrictive transfusion strategy significantly decreased the proportion of adults and children exposed to RBC transfusion. In most clinical contexts, there was no evidence of harm from a restrictive compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. Neurocritically ill patients, however, have better neurological outcomes at 6 to 12 months with a liberal transfusion strategy. Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes beyond mortality, and to what degree the optimal strategies for transfusion should be modified in some patient populations, including different types of acute bleeding, cancers and subgroups of patients with myocardial infarction and other neurological injuries. New studies need to recognise the clinical context and the limitations of the adoption of a single threshold of haemoglobin, and to consider evaluating the use of physiological parameters to modify transfusion.",

In critically ill patients with brain injury, unfavourable neurological outcome at 6 to 12 months was lower with a liberal transfusion strategy (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.22; 4 studies, 2297 participants) (moderate-certainty evidence). Transfusion-specific reactions are uncommon, but occurred more frequently with the liberal strategy (Peto odds ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.62; 18 studies, 11,505 participants). Paediatric threshold comparison We included eight trials (2764 participants), across a limited range of clinical contexts (critical care, cardiac surgery, haematological malignancies and severe malarial anaemia). The haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive group in critical care and haematological malignancies trials was between 6.5 g/dL and 8.0 g/dL, and between 7.0 g/dL and 9 g/dL in cardiac surgery trials, depending on the cardiac abnormality and stage of repair. Studies were generally at low risk of bias. There was no clear difference in 30-day mortality between restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies, although confidence intervals were wide (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.08; 7 studies, 2571 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was moderate-certainty evidence of no clear difference between threshold strategies for infection; very low-certainty evidence of little to no difference for thrombosis and very low-certainty evidence of little to no difference for the outcomes multiple organ dysfunction and cerebrovascular accident. Physiological triggers Nine trials in adults (3818 participants) and one trial in children (100 participants) were identified. These tested different interventions and measures of physiological parameters in diverse clinical populations. The risk of bias was variable. Meta-analysis was not appropriate due to heterogeneity."

          "text": "A restrictive transfusion strategy significantly decreased the proportion of adults and children exposed to RBC transfusion. In most clinical contexts, there was no evidence of harm from a restrictive compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. Neurocritically ill patients, however, have better neurological outcomes at 6 to 12 months with a liberal transfusion strategy. Further work is needed to improve our understanding of outcomes beyond mortality, and to what degree the optimal strategies for transfusion should be modified in some patient populations, including different types of acute bleeding, cancers and subgroups of patients with myocardial infarction and other neurological injuries. New studies need to recognise the clinical context and the limitations of the adoption of a single threshold of haemoglobin, and to consider evaluating the use of physiological parameters to modify transfusion."
